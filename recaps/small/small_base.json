        "Well, Sir Dedlock is back at Chesney Wold, but not totally recovered. Lady Dedlock has been buried in the family mausoleum. No one is told exactly how she died, and those few who do know are paid to stay quiet. George Rouncewell helps Sir Dedlock ride his horse. The stables are kept ship-shape by Phil. Mrs. Rouncewell is still the housekeeper. It's implied that when Sir Dedlock dies it'll be the end of the Dedlock family and its prominence.",

The Jarndyce and Jarndyce case is finally ready to \"come up,\" this time at Westminster Hall . On their way to Westminster, Esther and Allan meet Caddy passing by in a carriage. At Westminster Hall, they learn that legal costs have exhausted the entire worth of the estate. The shock is too much for the already ill Richard: though resolved to start life afresh -- \"to begin the world\" -- and reconciled at last with Mr. Jarndyce, he dies the same day. Miss Flite comes weeping to Esther. The \"poor, crazed\" woman has set her birds free. Lady Dedlock has been buried unobtrusively in the family mausoleum at Chesney Wold. How she died is a mystery. Sir Leicester, riding on the estate with George Rouncewell, constantly honors her memory and her burial place. He and Boythorn still quarrel over the disputed thoroughfare, but in a way that gives satisfaction to both. George and Phil Squod have a permanent residence in one of the lodges of the park. Chesney Wold, now headed only by an aging widower, settles into a \"dull repose.\" Sir Leicester himself will live only a little longer. In the evenings, Volumnia reads political treatises to him. She discovers that she will inherit the estate.",
        "\"Down in Lincolnshire\" The narrator says that Chesney Wold is now very quiet. Sir Leicester is still alive, but very sick. The feud with Boythorn still continues, but Boythorn now does it as a way of cheering Sir Leicester up. Phil now lives in a lodge on the grounds, maintaining the stables. Mrs. Rouncewell and George still care for Sir Leicester. There are visitors, including Bagnet. Much of the house is closed. Volumnia is still there, but the other cousins come only rarely. The house is so quiet and dismal that people are afraid to walk in it alone",

Boythorn, out of respect, tries to call off their feud about the right of way, but Sir Leicester needs something to keep him going, so they start it up again. George and Phil Squod are also retired in the country, keeping the lodge at Chesney Wold and waiting on Sir Leicester. Mrs. Rouncewell goes to church on the arm of her son. Volumnia amuses Sir Leicester and finds she will be his heir."

        "Tom does not return, and Silas's efforts to find him end in vain. In the meantime, a letter arrives from Aunt Polly, Sally's sister. Sally casts the letter aside when she sees Tom, who she thinks is Sid. The boy is brought in semi-conscious on a mattress, accompanied by a crowd including Jim, in chains, and the doctor. Some of the local men would like to hang Jim but are unwilling to risk having to compensate Jim's master. They treat Jim roughly and chain him hand and foot inside the shed. The doctor intervenes, telling the crowd how Jim has sacrificed his freedom to help nurse Tom. Sally, meanwhile, stays at Tom's bedside, glad that his condition has improved. Tom wakes and gleefully details how they set Jim free. Horrified to learn that Jim is now in chains, Tom explains that Miss Watson died two months ago and that her will stipulated that Jim should be set free. The old woman regretted ever having considered selling Jim down the river. Just then, Aunt Polly walks into the room. She has come to Arkansas from St. Petersburg after receiving a letter from Sally mentioning that Sid Sawyer--Tom's alias--had arrived with \"Tom\"--who was actually Huck. Tom has been intercepting communications between the sisters, and Polly has been forced to appear in person to sort out the confusion. After a tearful reunion with Sally, she identifies Tom and Huck and yells at both boys for their misadventures"
