        "The next night, Tom and Huck sneak out and start digging with their case knives. Huck agrees and tells Tom his head is getting \"leveler\" all the time. Jim wants to escape immediately, but Tom then tells Jim all about the little things he needs to do first, including writing in blood, throwing the tin plates out of the hut, etc. Tom then convinces the man who brings Jim his food that Jim is bewitched and offers to heal him by baking a pie, in which he plans to conceal the sheet ladder. Aunt Sally yells at poor Silas, who eventually discovers the missing spoon in his pocket, where Tom had placed it. Tom decides that the only way to steal back the spoon is to confuse his poor Aunt Sally even further. Tom has Huck hide one of spoons while Aunt Sally counts them, and then Huck puts it back when Aunt Sally counts again. By the time she has finished counting, Aunt Sally has no idea exactly how many spoons she has, and Tom is able to take one without any more trouble. Chapter 38 Tom designs a coat-of-arms for Jim to inscribe on the walls so as to permanently leave his mark on the prison cell. Next, Tom works out three mournful inscriptions and tells Jim he must carve them into a rock. Huck and Tom go to fetch an old grindstone for Jim to use as his rock, but it is too heavy for them to carry, so they are forced to allow Jim to leave his \"prison\" and come help them. Tom decides that Jim needs some cell companions, such as snakes and spiders. He tells Jim that he and Huck will find some for him, but Jim is vehemently opposed to the idea. Tom then tries to convince Jim to get a flower so he can water it with his tears. Chapter 39 Huck and Tom spend the next day catching creatures to live with Jim in his cell. They first gather about fifteen rats, but Aunt Sally's son frees them by accident and both Tom and Huck receive beatings for bringing rats into her house. Huck remarks that there was no shortage of snakes in the house for quite a while after that. Uncle Silas decides to start advertising Jim as a runaway slave in some of the local newspapers because he has failed to receive a reply to his earlier letters. Tom figures out how to stop Silas, by planting anonymous letters that warn him off this plan of action. Tom and Huck first plant a letter reading, \"Beware. Huck is frightened for their safety when he slips out the window and tells Tom they must leave immediately or they will be shot. As Tom, Huck and Jim start to move away from the hut, Tom gets caught on the fence and his britches rip quite loudly. When they get to a dark area, Huck, Jim, and Tom hide behind a bush and let the whole pack of farmers and dogs run past them. Once safe, they proceed to where the raft is hidden and Tom tells Jim he is a free man again, and that he will always be a free man from now on. Tom then shows them where he got a bullet in the leg, but Jim is worried for Tom's health. Jim tells Tom that he is not going to move until they get a doctor there and make sure he is safe. Tom gets mad at both of them and yells, but Huck ignores him and gets the canoe ready to go to town.",
        "Tom and Huck capture several rats to put in Jim's cabin, but one of the Phelps boys finds the box and lets all of the rats free into the house. After several creatures are accidentally freed in the Phelps' house, Tom and Huck finally capture enough rats, spiders, and snakes, and put them in Jim's cabin. To finish off the scheme, Tom writes an anonymous letter to the Phelps saying that a \"desperate gang of cutthroats\" will attempt to steal Jim out of the cabin. Huck returns to the house to pick up some butter and finds that the Phelps have gathered 15 men to battle the gang of cutthroats. Alarmed, Huck sneaks out the window and warns Tom that the men are here, and they must all escape immediately. Tom tells them to shove off, but Jim will not leave until a doctor has looked at Tom.",
        "Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas, rattled by the mysterious letter, send Tom and Huck to bed right after supper. Later that night, Huck sees that fifteen uneasy local farmers with guns have gathered in the front room of the house. Huck goes to the shed to warn Jim and Tom, but news of the armed men only excites Tom even more. In the darkness, Tom, Huck, and Jim escape through the hole they cut in the wall. Tom makes a noise going over the fence, attracting the attention of the men, who shoot at the boys and Jim as they run. Huck and Jim are concerned about Tom's wound, and Jim says they should get a doctor, since Tom would if the situation were reversed. Jim's statement confirms Huck's belief that Jim is \"white inside"

The men argue whether or not to hang Jim, and the doctor explains how Jim helped with Tom instead of running away. Tom relishes the retelling until he hears that Jim is still in captivity. Tom rises up in bed and demands that they free Jim because he has known all along that Miss Watson had died and set Jim free in her will. At that moment, Aunt Polly arrives, and Tom and Huck are forced to reveal their true identities.",
        "The doctor intervenes, telling the crowd how Jim has sacrificed his freedom to help nurse Tom. Tom wakes and gleefully details how they set Jim free. Horrified to learn that Jim is now in chains, Tom explains that Miss Watson died two months ago and that her will stipulated that Jim should be set free. She has come to Arkansas from St. Petersburg after receiving a letter from Sally mentioning that Sid Sawyer--Tom's alias--had arrived with \"Tom\"--who was actually Huck. After a tearful reunion with Sally, she identifies Tom and Huck and yells at both boys for their misadventures"

        "He carries with him a tiny note written by Mattie and left for him on the kitchen table: \"Don't trouble, Ethan\". He begins a farewell letter to Zeena. A coach is going to come later in the day to pick up Mattie's heavy trunk, and Jotham is going to take Mattie to the station when he goes to pick up the new hired girl. He suddenly considers a new plan: if he tells Andrew Hale that he needs money to hire a girl to help Zeena, he could use the cash advance to flee west with Mattie. She admires Ethan for taking care of Zeena and before her, his mother. He realizes the truth of his situation: Zeena cannot fend for herself, and Ethan's flight with Mattie would depend on deceiving the Hales.",
        "Ethan has a little make-shift study that he hadn't used in a while be because the heater that previously heated it was given to Mattie for her room. When Zeena was safely sleeping, Ethan headed to that room. He decides to write Zeena a letter and then leave with Mattie the next day. The farm isn't worth anything to sell, and there is no way Zeena could do any of the work on it. He cries and falls asleep thinking of how he and Mattie were supposed to sled tonight. When he wakes up, he realizes it's Mattie's final day on the farm. Mattie is waiting for him. Ethan touches Mattie and says, \"I don't want you should trouble either\" . Ethan warns her not to let Zeena get to her today. When Jotham comes in he tells Ethan that Zeena asked him to drive Mattie away. Ethan says that he will be the one to drive Mattie. When Zeena comes in she tells Mattie she's arranged for her trunk to be transported.",
        "Directly following her outburst over the broken dish, Zeena retires upstairs to bed, and a shaken Mattie continues to clear up the kitchen. Flinging aside in disgust a handmade cushion of Zeena's, Ethan mentally reviews the case of a local man who had deserted his wife in favor of the woman he loved. Encouraged by this precedent, Ethan resolves to run away with Mattie, and he prepares to write a letter of farewell to Zeena, leaving her the farm and the mill. But Ethan pauses at the prospect of starting over without any money, and he pictures the grim situation in which Zeena will be left. Ethan wakes up cold, stiff, and hungry, and rises in the knowledge that this will be Mattie's last day beneath his roof. As he stands alone in his study, he hears a step behind him and turns around to see Mattie, full of concern for his well-being after having listened all night for his return upstairs. Ethan, overwhelmed by her show of caring, lights the kitchen fire for her, and, as they sit down to a breakfast of leftovers, they decide not to worry about Zeena's threats. When Powell presses to secure the details for the new hired girl's arrival and Mattie's departure, Ethan responds by saying that the matter of Mattie's dismissal is itself still unresolved. Back in the kitchen, the men enter to find Mattie and Zeena seated at a full breakfast table. Zeena eats heartily, feeds scraps to the cat, and discusses departure and arrival times with Powell. She then endeavors to settle a few final matters with Mattie, as Ethan looks on wordlessly. Frantically searching for a solution, Ethan decides again to ask Andrew Hale for the advance on the lumber, feeling that Hale would relent if he thought that the money would make a difference in Zeena's health. With the money, Ethan decides, he will be able to run away with Mattie and start a new life elsewhere. She informs him that Hale is resting at home for the morning, and she speaks kindly to him about his fortitude in caring for Zeena before she goes on.",
        "He despises the thought of living out his years with Zeena. He goes to lie down on his couch, and throws away a cushion that Zeena made for him when they were engaged. Ethan springs up and goes to his desk to start a letter to Zeena. Even if there were not, Zeena could never run the place. She would have to go back to her people, the same fate Zeena was forcing on Mattie. In addition, he would have trouble supporting Mattie. Ethan knows he does not have the money to pay for he and Mattie to go. Ethan wakes with the realization it will be Mattie's last day with him. As the sun comes up and Mattie goes about her work, Ethan feels better. He feels that with the return of daylight, Zeena, too, will see that it is insane to let Mattie go. Ethan and Mattie try to reassure each other, but they are not bolstered. Ethan is floored and wonders how Jotham knows about Mattie's leaving. Ethan says he is not sure Mattie is going. Zeena, alert and active, remarks that the geraniums have been neglected. She then turns to Jotham and asks when Mattie's trunk will be picked up. Zeena says that she would like to go over the contents with Mattie before the trunk is picked up, implying that Mattie has stolen something. She adds that she has heard of Zeena's recent trip to the new doctor and sympathizes with Ethan about all the trouble he has had in his life.",
        "After Zeena retires upstairs, Mattie clears up the kitchen and Ethan makes his usual rounds outside. The kitchen is empty when he gets back, but Mattie has left a note for him, saying, \"Don't trouble, Ethan. \" Ethan feels he cannot give up the \"life\" and \"warmth\" that Mattie gives him. A storm of rebellion rises within him: why should he waste his life in service of the bitter, querulous Zeena, wose only pleasure is to inflict pain on him? He flings aside a cushion that Zeena had made and reflects on the case of a local man who had escaped from a similar life of misery by going West with the girl he loved. Encouraged by this example, Ethan decides to go West with Mattie, leaving a note for Zeena. And the farm and mill were mortgaged to the hilt; Zeena would only clear a thousand dollars on the sale. Ethan wakes cold, stiff and hungry, and recalls that it is Mattie's last day. Mattie comes in, aware that he has not been to bed, since she was listening all night for him to come upstairs. He comforts himself that Zeena may relent and allow Mattie to stay. When he goes out to the cow-barn he meets Jotham, who tells Ethan of the arrangements that Zeena has already made with him to take Mattie and her trunk to the station. Ethan replies that the question of Mattie's leaving is not settled. Zeena is unusually alert and is feeding the cat. She asks Jotham about the travel arrangements for Mattie. She and Mattie leave the room, and Jotham tells Ethan that he will go ahead with the travel arrangements. Mattie's presence seems to infuse the entire scene. Mrs Hale tells him that she has heard about Zeena's going to see the new doctor. She expresses regret that Zeena is not feeling well and says that she does not know what she would have done if Ethan had not been around to take care of her. He cannot find the heart to leave Zeena alone and destitute, particularly if it means deceiving two kind people."

While Strether is thinking that his whole life has been a lie since getting to Paris. When Strether leaves them and goes home, he realizes that all along, he's been allowing himself to enjoy Paris because he has enjoyed being among young women and men while still thinking to himself that he wasn't doing anything morally wrong.

Finally, Strether pipes up and tells Chad that he'll be a monster if he ever leaves Madame de Vionnet. It looks like this is that one last favor Strether told Madame he would do for her. Chad says that he would probably never do this, but probably ain't good enough for Strether. Strether says that he wants this to be the last thing he says to Chad during their time in Paris.

The van der Luydens are dismayed to learn that Ellen had been to see Mrs. Beaufort, an action they conceive of as imprudent, considering the Beauforts' fall from good society. At the opera, Archer feels guilty about his intended tryst with Ellen. Archer suddenly feels the urge to confess to her, and he persuades May to leave the opera early. Back home, Archer is on the verge of confessing when May interrupts him by mentioning that Ellen has decided to return to Europe."

        "In the worst letter ever, Griffin tells Kemp that he is taking charge: \"Port Burdock is no longer under the Queen, tell your Colonel of Police, and the rest of them; it is under me--the Terror! The letter also says that Griffin will kill Kemp that day. What's even better is that Griffin sent that letter without a stamp, so Kemp had to pay for it upon delivery. He writes a note for Adye, saying that Kemp will act as bait to catch Griffin. Adye shows up later, saying that Griffin grabbed the note from Kemp's servant. So now Griffin knows that Kemp wants to set a trap. Adye borrows Kemp's gun and tries to go for help, but Griffin trips him up and grabs the gun."

        "Flaminius, one of Timon's servants, arrives at Lucullus's house to ask for a loan, carrying a box under his arm. He gives Flaminius several coins as a bribe to tell Timon that he didn't speak to Lucullus, but Flaminius hurls them back at him. Flaminius wishes him ill, and departs. Servilius, Timon's servant, enters. Timon's third servant enters with Sempronius, another of Timon's friends. Sempronius is annoyed that Timon asks him for a loan, and suggests he had better ask Lucullus or Lucius or even Ventidius. Sempronius is even more annoyed when he hears that he has been asked after the other three; he wonders if he is Timon's last refuge.",
        "Flavius arrives, speaking sadly about his fallen master. Timon says he has forgotten all men, so Flavius says he was once Timon's poor honest servant. Flavius insists his grief is honest, and Timon sees he weeps. Timon softens to Flavius, since his weeping demonstrates a sense of pity. Flavius offers his money to Timon. He says Flavius is more honest than he is wise, for by betraying Timon he could have found a much better job. And then he asks Flavius if his kindness is a plot, \"A usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts, / expecting in return twenty for one?\" Flavius insists that what he offers is real kindness and love, and he offers to take care of Timon's comfort in the wilderness. Timon gives Flavius money on the condition that he lives apart from mankind, that he never gives anything to even the skinniest beggar. Flavius begs to stay, but Timon sends him away.",
        "Another servant of Timon visits Lord Sempronius and tells him that his master has asked for his help. Sempronius like the others has no intention of helping Timon.",
        "Later when he recognizes Timon, he is shocked to see Timons state and confesses that he was unaware of Timons misfortune. Timon instructs the prostitutes to spread disease among men, to which Timandra gets angry, but Alcibiades understands Timons state of mind. Flavius comes looking for Timon. But when the steward is ready to share his wealth, Timon is relieved to see a true human being and declares that Flavius is the only honest man in the world. Even then he asks Flavius whether there is a hidden motive behind his being kind to him. Flavius muses that if his master had this suspicious nature earlier, then he would have understood the true nature of his friends. Flavius wishes that his master would get rich and powerful once again.",

        "The setting is the garden in the Manor House--Jack's country estate. Miss Prism retorts that Uncle Jack is only looking out for Cecily's education. Cecily complains that Uncle Jack is so serious. This piques Cecily's interest and she wishes aloud that Uncle Jack would bring Ernest by sometime so that Miss Prism could reform him. While they're out, Merriman the butler tells Cecily that a Mr. Ernest Worthing has just arrived. Cecily is overjoyed to finally be able to meet the infamous Ernest, but she's scared at the same time. Algernon enters, disguised as Ernest. Charmingly, Algernon/Ernest asks Cecily to try to reform him that very afternoon. As they're flirting and Ernest is finding every way possible to compliment Cecily, like asking for a pink rose for his button-hole \"because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily\" . Algernon learns that Jack plans to send Ernest to Australia. When they ask him about it, Jack announces that he's returned early because his brother Ernest is dead. When Dr. Chasuble offers to perform a funeral ceremony for Ernest, Jack suddenly remembers something. Cecily comes from the house to meet her Uncle Jack with the happy news that his brother Ernest arrived just recently and is now in the dining-room. The mystery is solved when Jack sees Algernon sitting at the table. Jack refuses to shake hands with Algernon. We learn from Cecily that Ernest has been telling her about his poor friend, Mr. Bunbury. Finally, Cecily declares she will never speak to Uncle Jack again if he doesn't shake hands with Ernest. Jack gives in reluctantly and Miss Prism praises Cecily for her wonderful act of kindness today. They leave Jack and Ernest together. Furiously, Jack tells Algy to leave at once. But he's interrupted when Merriman comes in to reveal that Mr. Ernest's luggage has been put in the bedroom next to Jack's. Jack tells Merriman that unfortunately Ernest's dog-cart has arrived to take him away; he's been called back to town. While Jack rants at Algernon, Algernon talks about how pretty Cecily is. Jack declares the dog-cart is here and leaves, just in time to miss Algy's comment that he has fallen in love with Cecily. She and Ernest/Algernon exchange glances. She pleads with Merriman to let Ernest stay for another five minutes. Algernon informs her that Jack is sending him away and compliments her beauty. Distraught, he asks her if she could love him under any other name... say... Algernon, for instance. At that declaration, Ernest/Algernon promptly begins asking her about the rector and whether or not he performs christenings. Algernon leaves to find Dr. Chasuble about a very important matter. Soon, Merriman enters to tell Cecily that a Miss Fairfax has arrived to see Mr. Worthing. Cecily invites Miss Fairfax to sit with her until Uncle Jack comes out. They talk for a little while before Gwendolen works up the balls to ask Cecily if she can inspect her. Gwendolen, peering through her glasses, finds Cecily rather too attractive and loudly wishes that she were a bit older and more decidedly more dowdy. She asks about Cici's relations and finds out that Mr. Worthing is Cecily's guardian. Now that's problematic, Gwendolen says, since Ernest never mentioned it to her. When Cecily hears the name Ernest, she quickly explains the situation. Gwendolen rises to her feet. The two women eye each other coldly before Gwendolen announces--alluding to Cecily's rude manners--that they obviously move in different social circles. Right before they can start clawing at each other, Merriman comes by to arrange their tea things. As Merriman serves them, they glare at each other but chitchat in cordial tones. When Gwendolen jumps on him and asks if he's to be married to Cecily, Jack laughs it off and kisses Gwendolen. Cecily replies that he's not Ernest Worthing; that's Uncle Jack. Right on cue, Algernon enters and Cecily goes through the same routine with him. When he confirms he's not to be married to Gwendolen, she allows him to kiss her. Cecily backs away when she hears \"Algernon.\" They finally ask Jack who Ernest is and he is forced to admit that Ernest doesn't exist. They argue for a while and Algernon sits down agitatedly and begins to eat the muffins left by the ladies."

        "That afternoon, Mary is busy with the garden and realizes she won't have time to see Colin. She goes to his room and they get into a big argument, with Colin accusing Mary of being selfish. Colin threatens to send away Dickon if Mary doesn't spend more time with him, which enrages Mary. That night, Mary wakes up to hear Colin wailing and screaming for what seems like ages. Mary's words help Colin to snap out of his tantrum. The caretakers are amazed and let Mary put Colin to sleep. Mary tells Colin in a quiet voice about all the things she saw in the garden the day before. The next day, Mary meets up with Dickon in the garden, who is accompanied by a crow, a fox, and two tame squirrels. Mary tells Dickon about the episode with Colin, and Dickon feels quite sorry for the boy. Dickon insists that they have to get Colin to come outside, where he will feel happier and be less likely to think about negative things. Mary makes Dickon laugh by trying to speak in a Yorkshire dialect. Colin apologizes for threatening to send Dickon away before. At that moment, Mary decides to reveal to Colin that Dickon will come to see him the next day with his animal companions. Later that day, Dr. Craven comes to visit Colin. The doctor is surprised to find Colin with Mary and asking if he can go out soon to get some fresh air. Dr. Craven ends up staying for a very short time and not giving Colin any of the usual medicine. The next day, Mary runs into Colin's room declaring that it is spring. This morning Dickon and his animal companions--a newborn lamb, the fox, the crow, and the two squirrels--come to visit Colin in his room. Colin is delighted and amazed at the sight of Dickon and his creatures. Dickon shows Colin the animals and they look at picture books. When he enters Colin's room, he is surprised by Dickon's animals. Later, the nurse prepares Colin to go outside and he is left with Dickon and Mary, who push him in his wheelchair out into the gardens. Dickon suggests that soon Colin will be well enough to walk beside them instead of being pushed in a chair. When Ben spots Colin in the garden, he is extremely surprised. Colin tells Ben that he must obey him and that now he must be in on the secret of the garden.",
        "Needless to say, Mary and Dickon are relieved not to have to explain. Mary and Dickon look up to see Ben Weatherstaff on top of a ladder, looking over the garden wall. Ben shakes his fist at Mary and yells at her, saying that she has no business being in there. Dickon wheels Colin's chair over to Ben so Colin can have his say. Colin asks if Ben realizes who he is. Ben sees Colin's resemblance to his tragically deceased mom, but he calls Colin \"th'poor cripple\" . Colin is so offended at Ben's assumption that his back and legs are crooked that he finally stands up on his own. Now Colin has the confidence to tell Ben to leave them alone with their Secret Garden. For his part, Ben is quite overcome with emotion by the sight of Colin standing tall on his own.",
        "In the garden, Mary and Dickon begin speaking Yorkshire dialect, and, for the first time, Colin joins them. Mary and Dickon set about showing him all the treasures of the garden, but hesitate when Colin asks about the great gray tree from which his mother fell to her death. Mrs. Sowerby, Dickon's mother, suspects that Colin's mother is somehow still in the secret garden, still watching over her son, and that it is her influence that has brought the three children to the garden. Privately, Mary believes this to be a part of what she calls \"Magic,\" of the kind that Dickon works on everything that comes near to him. Colin tells Mary and Dickon that he intends to come out with them every day, and that soon he shall walk on his own and be strong enough to work in the garden. In his shock at seeing Colin, Ben Weatherstaff calls him \"the poor cripple\" and asks if he has crooked legs and a crooked back. Colin is incensed, and, with surprising strength, suddenly rises from his wheeled chair and commands the old man to look at him, so that Ben might attest to his unquestionable soundness."

Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Katharina then loses her temper and beats Grumio. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt. Tranio offers his own house, noting that the banquet will not be a grand affair but promising a better one later on in Pisa.
