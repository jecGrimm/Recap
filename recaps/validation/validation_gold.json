        "Mr. Jarndyce goes to Yorkshire to see Allan Woodcourt. Soon he invites Esther to join them. He has settled Allan in a new \"Bleak House.\" Upon seeing Esther's face when she reads the name of the new house, Jarndyce decides not to be selfish and releases Esther from her promise to marry him. He knows that she will be happier as Allan's wife than she would be as his. Esther is dumbfounded. Allan accepts Jarndyce's offer of Esther's hand, and Esther agrees. Esther passes from being the mistress of one Bleak House, to being mistress of the new one. Mr. Guppy, back at the St Alban's Bleak House, still pursues Esther. He has set up a business with Jobling, and has brought his mother to propose marriage to Esther again. Jarndyce doesn't even have to consult Esther to know that she will refuse him, and he refuses for her. In a funny scene, Mrs. Guppy is so put out by her refusal that she orders Mr. Jarndyce out of his own room in his own house. Esther's scars are slowly fading, and her good looks are coming back. In Chapter 65 the Jarndyce case is finallly ready to be argued before the court, but in Westminster Hall. On the way, the young people see Caddy Turveydrop, who congratulates Esther on her engagement to Woodcourt, and embraces her. They arrive late in court, and they learn that, although the estate would have been conferred entirely on Ada and Richard, it has been completely consumed in costs. The irony is so great that even though Richard, who is very ill, resolves to \"begin the world,\" he dies that day. Miss Flite arrives, weeping. She has finally freed her birds. In Chapter 66, we learn that Lady Dedlock, her body retrieved by her husband, has been buried in the family mausoleum at Chesney Wold. The world does not know how she died, and Sir Leicester keeps it a mystery. He rides around the estate with George, honoring her memory. The dispute with Boythorn continues, but with less real vehemence on both sides. The world of Chesney Wold becomes quieter, as Sir Leicester is an aging widower uninterested in society. He confers the estate on Volumnia. The final chapter jumps forward seven years to the happy Esther Woodcourt living in Lincolnshire. She and Allan are blessed with two little girls, and Ada's little boy, named Richard, was born not long after his father's death. Ada divides her time between both Bleak Houses. Esther's maid, Charley, is happily married to a miller. Esther now has little Emma, the youngest Neckett, as a maid. We have one more look at Mrs. Jellyby, how has decided that Africa is a lost cause and now campaigns for women in Parliament. Caddy is a happy wife and mother, though her child is deaf and dumb, and Prince has grown lame from too much dancing. Even Peepy Jellyby is reprised, all grown up and preparing to go into the Custom House like his father. Jarndyce, Ada, Woodcourt, and Allan all live happily ever after."

        "Huck returns to town and finds a doctor. Instead of allowing Huck to come along, the doctor makes Huck tell him where the raft is and takes the canoe out alone to find Tom and Jim. Huck falls asleep on a woodpile while waiting for him to return. When he wakes up, he is told the doctor has not yet returned. Huck soon sees Silas, who is very glad Huck is not hurt. Together, they go to the post office, and Silas asks where Sid is. Huck makes up a story about Sid taking off to gather news about the events of the night. When they return home, Aunt Sally makes a fuss over Huck, but is glad he has returned. A large gathering is held at the house, and the women discuss how they think Jim must have been crazy due to Jim's grindstone inscriptions and the tools found in his hut, all of which Huck and Tom actually crafted. Aunt Sally is worried about Sid's whereabouts. Huck tells her the same tale he told Uncle Silas, but it does not set her mind at ease. During the night, Huck sneaks out several times and each time sees her sitting with a lit candle on the front porch, waiting for Sid's return. Huck feels very sorry for her and wishes he could tell her everything. Chapter 42 The next day, the doctor appears, bringing Tom on a stretcher and Jim in chains. Tom is comatose due to a fever from the bullet wound, but is still alive. Aunt Sally takes him inside and immediately starts to care for him. Tom improves rapidly and is almost completely better by the next day. Huck goes into the bedroom to sit with Tom and see how he is doing. Aunt Sally walks in as well and while both of them are sitting there, Tom wakes up. He immediately starts to tell Aunt Sally about everything the two of them did and how they managed to help Jim escape. Aunt Sally cannot believe they were creating all of the trouble around her house. When Tom hears that Jim has been recaptured he shouts at them that they cannot chain Jim up anymore. He tells them that Jim has been free ever since Miss Watson died and freed him in her will. Apparently Miss Watson was so ashamed about planning to sell Jim that she felt it best to set him free. At that moment Aunt Polly, Aunt Sally's sister, appears. Aunt Sally is so surprised that she rushes over to her sister to give her a hug. Aunt Polly proceeds to tell Aunt Sally that the boys masquerading as Tom and Sid are actually Huck and Tom. Embarrassed, the boys look quite sheepish. Aunt Polly only gets angry when she discovers that Tom has been stealing and hiding her letters. She also explains to Aunt Sally that in regards to Jim, Tom is correct. Miss Watson freed Jim in her will. Chapter 43 Tom tells Huck he had planned for them to run all the way to the mouth of the Mississippi if they had managed to escape unharmed. Jim gets a positive reception in the house because of how well he cared for Tom when he was sick. Tom, feeling slightly guilty, gives Jim forty dollars for putting up with them the entire time and for being such a good prisoner. Jim turns to Huck and tells him he was right about being a rich man one day. Huck asks about his six thousand dollars, assuming Pap managed to take it all. However, Tom explains that Pap was never seen again after Huck disappeared. Finally, Jim reveals that the man he and Huck found dead in the floating house was in fact Pap, but Jim had not wanted Huck to see him. Huck ends the novel by announcing that Aunt Sally wants to adopt him now, so he needs to start planning on heading west since he tried to be civilized once before, and did not like it."

When Aunt Polly and the Phelpses hear about the assistance Jim gave the doctor in nursing Tom, they immediately unchain him, feed him, and treat him like a king. Tom gives Jim forty dollars for his troubles, and Jim declares that the omen of his hairy chest--which was supposed to bring him fortune--has come true. Tom makes a full recovery and wears the bullet from his leg on a watch-guard around his neck. He and Huck would like to go on another adventure, to \"Indian Territory\". Huck thinks it quite possible that Pap has taken all his money by now, but Jim says that could not have happened. Jim tells Huck that the dead body they found on the floating house during the flood was Pap. Huck now has nothing more to write about and is \"rotten glad\" about that, because writing a book turned out to be quite a task. He does not plan any future writings.

        "Equality 7-2521 figures out that \"I\" is the word he seeks when he reads one of the books in the house. When he sees the word, he understands and weeps in pity for man, knowing why he had never felt guilt for his sins and that centuries of repression will not destroy man's spirit. He reads for days and tells the Golden One about what he learns. In answer, she looks at him and says, \"I love you.\" He decides that they must choose their own names that distinguish them from others as names used to do in the Unmentionable Times. He chooses Prometheus, after the ancient man who brought light from god to man and was punished for his kindness. For the Golden One, he chooses Gaea, after the earth goddess who was the mother of all other gods. Prometheus now sees his future clearly. He recalls the Saint of the pyre, who chose Prometheus as his heir when Prometheus was only ten years old. Prometheus is now the heir of those who died for the cause of the word \"I.\" He plans to live in his house and survive on the products of his own hands while learning more from his books. Prometheus hopes to rebuild what the present has lost and go even further, while others with his skill continue to be held back by the weak and the dull-witted. He learns that in the past, men called his power of the sky Electricity and that electricity had been the source of many of their inventions. He decides to repair the motor that provides electricity to the house and bring light to his house. He will also use wires to create a barrier separating his property from other men because although they have the advantage of numbers, they do not have his mind. Gaea is pregnant, and Prometheus plans to raise their son as a man who understands the concept of \"I\" and takes pride in his own spirit. After he learns as much as he can from his new home, he also hopes to return to the City and retrieve his friend International 4-8818, as well as those such as Fraternity 2-5503 and Solidarity 9-6347 who feel their servitude and the loss of their individuality. He plans to lead them to his home and \"write the first chapter in the new history of man.\" Looking on the history of men, he wonders how man had abandoned his spirit for so long when all he had to do was remain free of other men after freeing himself from gods, kings, and birthrights and declaring himself to hold inalienable rights. He gave up his freedom for the word \"We\" and lost everything he had made, and anyone who sought as Prometheus had to regain it was punished. He asks why men had not anticipated their fall and suggests that a few men might have foreseen it but went unheeded. Prometheus wishes that he could tell the men who failed to stop the decay that hope still exists because \"man will go on. Man, not men.\" He and his friends will rebuild against the decrees of other men and of the Councils, and one day he will free the cities from enslavement. To signify his fight for freedom, he will carve the immortal word \"ego\" into the stone of his home."

        "Equality 7-2521 explains that he discovered the word \"I\" when he read the first book he found in the house. When he finally understood the word, he started to cry, and dropped the book. It was that beautiful. Equality 7-2521 also understood that it had been his sense of himself - of \"I\" - that revolted against his society and made him sin. No matter how hard society might try, that \"I\" can never be completely destroyed by it. Equality 7-2521 spent days reading the books he found. At last, he told Liberty 5-3000 what he had discovered. When she learned the word \"I,\" Liberty 5-3000 told Equality 7-2521 \"I love you.\" Finally, What a relief. Equality 7-2521 also told Liberty 5-3000 that it was time to get some new names. He decided to be Prometheus, after a heroic figure from mythology. Equality 7-2521 decided to call Liberty 5-3000 \"Gaea,\" after the earth goddess. Now, Equality 7-2521 - a.k.a. Prometheus - writes, he sees his own future life clearly. He will live in the house with Gaea, learn to grow their own food, and study the books carefully. Already, he's learned that the power he used in his light-box is called electricity, and that it was electricity that powered the house in which he's living. He plans to learn how to produce and control it. He'll even build an electric fence around the house, once he figures out how. Apparently, Gaea is already pregnant with Prometheus' child. When he's born , Prometheus will raise him like a real man, who knows the word \"I.\" Prometheus plans to eventually return to his old City, to find all of the individuals whose spirit hasn't been crushed yet, like International 4-8818. He'll lead them out of the City, to Freedom. Prometheus says Freedom means freedom from one's brothers. It is only other people that can take an individual's freedom away. Prometheus wonders how it could have been possible that human beings, after slowly winning their freedom from gods, kings, and each other, could have given it up again? The answer he comes up with? People started to worship the word \"we.\" And once that happened, civilization fell apart. Free thinking perished, and so did all of the great individuals who had kept society functioning. Prometheus is still shocked that it was ever able to happen, and that people did not see what was going on as it happened. But, he proclaims, \"man will go on. Man, not men\" . Prometheus swears that the day will come when he will destroy the cities and free all of the enslaved. And his home will be the capital of the new world. Prometheus promises to fight for the freedom of man, and for the holy word, which will be his banner. \"The word which can never die on this earth, for it is the heart of it, and the meaning, and the glory\" . The word? You guessed it: \"EGO.\""

        "Equality 7-2521 says that when, in the course of his reading, he first discovered and understood the meaning of the word \"I,\" he wept -- he who had never known tears. Equality 7-2521 reads many books for many days. When he finally lays aside his studies, he calls the Golden One and tells her what he has learned. Her first words on hearing his discoveries are: \"I love you.\" He tells her that the code of individualism requires each person to have their own name to differentiate them from the rest of humankind. He tells her of a figure about whom he has read. He was a legendary hero who lived far in the past, who took the light of the gods and brought it to humans. In this way, \"he taught men to be gods.\" He suffered for his deeds as all bearers of light must suffer. His name was Prometheus. \"It shall be your name,\" replies the Golden One. Additionally, he tells her of a heroine from the legends of the past. She was a goddess who was the mother of the earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. He requests that the Golden One take this name, for she is to be the mother of a new kind of gods. The Golden One agrees. Prometheus looks ahead and sees the future clearly before him. Prometheus says that he will continue to live in his own house and learn to grow food by tilling the soil. He will gain much knowledge from his books and use that knowledge in the coming years to re-create the achievements of the past. He is proud of the attainments he can reach, but also saddened by the inability of others to do the same, for their minds are shackled by the collectivist philosophy that keeps them enslaved. Prometheus learns that the power of the sky was known to the freethinkers of the past; they called it electricity and used it to light their cities, heat their homes, and power their inventions. He has found the engine in the home that produces this power and will learn to repair it. He will study the wires that carry this power, learn how to use them, and then create a network of wires around his house and the paths that lead to his house. In this way, he will make the house impregnable from assault by others, for they have nothing with which to threaten him but their numbers. They use brute force, but he uses his mind. Prometheus and Gaea will live on their mountaintop in peace and security. He says that she is pregnant with his child, who will be raised as a free man. Their son will be taught the word \"I\" and will learn reverence for his own spirit. He will learn what pride there is in being a human individual. When Prometheus's work is accomplished -- when he has read the books, fortified their home, and tilled the soil -- he intends to stealthily venture for the last time into the city of his birth. There he will call to him all those of independent spirit who remain -- his friend International 4-8818 and all those like him. He will seek out Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason, and Solidarity 9-6347, who screams in the night. He will reach out to any of the men and women whose heads are still unbowed, who retain the slightest spark of autonomy and who yearn in some form for freedom. These individuals will flock to him, and they will return to his fortress. Prometheus says that here, in the uncharted wilderness, they will build their city and write a new chapter in the history of human freedom."

Summary Equality 7-2521 tells us that he has discovered the word \"I\" while reading the books in his library. The discovery moves him to tremendous elation and pity for mankind. After he has read for some time, he calls the Golden One to him and tells her about what he has found. She listens and then tells him she loves him. He then decides that they each need a new name. He names himself Prometheus, and he names her Gaea. She accepts her name without comment. Equality 7-2521 concludes that the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, whom he saw burned at the stake in his youth, chose him as his heir to carry on his crusade after he was gone. He resolves to live in his new home and kill and raise his own food and learn the secrets of the Unmentionable Times from the books in the house. He will rebuild the world that has disintegrated at the hands of the collectivists because he is not shackled to the weakest of his society. He will build a fence of wires around his house so that no one from his old city can come onto his property unless he chooses to allow them. The Golden One becomes pregnant, and Equality 7-2521 resolves that his son will be raised as a real man who takes pride in his own existence. He will work to get his house into working order and his land planted, and when he has succeeded in renovating and restoring his home, he will go back to the city and gather the few people, including his friend International 4-8818, whose spirits have not been broken by society. He will bring them up to his home to begin a new race. Equality 7-2521 meditates on human history. He says that man was first enslaved by the gods, but that he broke free from the gods. Man was then enslaved by kings, but he revolted from the kings. He was then enslaved by his birth, kin, and race, and he broke free from all these things. He declared himself to have naturally endowed rights of which he could not be deprived. Equality 7-2521 wonders about everything that men have lost in the name of collectivism and why men could not see their demise coming. He concludes that there must have been some men who did see it coming and suffered great agonies during the fall, and he wishes he had a way to tell them across time that their hope is not forever lost. He concludes that man's spirit will always prevail over the evils of collectivism, though it may take time. He resolves that he will bring back the lost world for the sake of man's freedom, rights, life, and honor. Even if his new race fails, its members' sense of individualism will never die because these members are united under the most important word in human history: \"ego.\""

She is addicted to morphine and cannot find another job in the city because she will be found out to be a whore. Jurgis sees that she wants him to leave, so he does. Jurgis immerses himself in \"the world of ideas. Though he is only a hotel porter, he spends his interests and energy on learning about the socialist cause. One night, he is specifically invited to attend a dinner at the home of a man named Fisher, a man who had become a millionaire but gave it up to live in the heart of the city's slums. Fisher is \"one of the minds of the movement. Jurgis feels out of place at the dinner since he is just a common worker, and everyone else is a gentleman or lady. He takes a seat in the corner and listens to the conversations. The first debate of the evening begins between two of the Socialist Party members, a former professor named Nicholas Schliemann and a former itinerant preacher named Lucas. Schliemann comments that the final great battle of the socialist movement will be between the Socialist Party and the Catholic Church. Religion, he says, is an opiate of the masses and has no place in the future socialist world. He tells the group that religion is a fraud that perpetrates the imbalance of power. Lucas, a former evangelical preacher, attempts to defend the word of God, \"which is one long cry of the human spirit for deliverance from the sway of oppression. Lucas goes down a list of passages from the Bible and stories of Biblical figures that represent the tenets of socialism. His most ardent argument is for Jesus Christ whom he says \"denounced in unmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time\" and was crucified for upsetting the social order. He gives a long speech on the merits of Christianity as being harmonious with Socialism, and in the end, Schliemann accepts his proposal. A man named Maynard, an editor of an East Coast newspaper that denounced socialism, takes the chance to note how the two socialists cannot even agree on the meaning of the movement. The men then agree on a definition of the basics: \"that a socialist believes in the common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life; and, second, that a socialist believes that the means by which this is to be brought about is the class-conscious political organization of the wage-earners. This definition gives Schliemann the opportunity to begin a long speech in defense of socialism. He tells Maynard of how the socialist society would organize labor; a job for everyone with no desire for profit so that each man earned a wage commensurate with his work. He details how competition in society is a wasteful process that creates innumerable jobs and positions that do nothing but waste money and labor. Advertising is simply a \"science of persuading people to buy what they do not want. However, by those with the means of production take advantage of those that actually produce useful things. Schliemann details the advances of science, such as farming machines and dishwashing machines that make some menial labor unnecessary. This will free up labor to produce more meaningful products for society. In terms of creative capital, Schliemann details how each person with a creative impulse will be able to support himself through wages given by those that sought to reward his work. Socialism will rid the world of the negative waste of competition and give the world a positive moral stance on which to produce meaningful goods and services, he argues. Election Day comes a few hours after the dinner. Jurgis goes to the meeting hall with other Socialist Party members to hear the election results. The Socialist Party makes great gains all over the Midwest. In Chicago, the Socialist vote increases from 6700 to 47,000. All across the Midwest in towns large and small, there is a great numerical increase in the number of Socialist votes counted. In the end, the Socialist vote ends up as over four hundred thousand, \"an increase of something like three hundred and fifty per cent in four years. The Socialists rejoice at these numbers, but a speaker comes before the hall and warns the crowd against losing the momentum. He tells them that future elections will be difficult but that with perseverance they will overcome the Beef Trust and \"Chicago will be ours"

He has his own system for living under capitalism: he earns money working the fields over the summer and uses that money to buy a precise, scientific amount of food to keep him going the rest of the year. Jurgis walks in on an argument between Lucas and Schliemann on the value of religion to the socialist cause. Lucas believes wholeheartedly in using the Bible to preach about the redistribution of wealth. He points out that Jesus stood against the pride, greed, and luxury that wealth brings. Was it not Jesus who said, in the Sermon on the Mount: \"Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of Heaven\" ? Lucas keeps going on and on about Jesus as the first truly class-conscious man. Schliemann asks how they can feel free to use the Bible to preach this message when, right now, Christian bishops are accumulating huge wealth on the backs of the working man. Mr. Maynard, the east cost magazine editor, asks how it can be that two socialists disagree so actively about what direction to take the party? Lucas believes that socialism is a tool to creating a new promised land on Earth, New Jerusalem. Schliemann wants to see the centralization of all factories and private property, along with absolute freedom in thought and artistic production. Schliemann thinks this would lead to the natural development of communities based on like-minded people who choose to live and associate with one another. They would have so much more leisure time if they didn't have to compete with one another for work and there would be real time to devote to art and writing. Mr. Maynard wants to know how a society could possibly get by while demanding so little work from its members. Schliemann points out that capitalism wastes a lot of work on competition and strife between companies. If there was no concern about improving your standard of living, if everyone had enough to get by all right, the average worker would be much less stressed out and overwhelmed. After all, look how much each company spends on advertising! Without competition, there would be no need for marketing or for lying about the value of goods. Under this system, prices could be a lot lower because there would be no profit attached - a book would cost as much as necessary to cover production and no more. Schliemann doesn't mean that everyone will get exactly the same things - some people will work harder than others, and some will work less. Thus, some will get more than others. Still, everyone will be rewarded according to his efforts, and no one will be left behind. After the revolution, all of the social ills of ignorance, malnourishment of children, prostitution, and homelessness will be totally eliminated. Once labor is no longer figured into the cost of production, people won't have an incentive to do unpleasant work. In other words, let's say you were looking at two jobs, and one involved slaughtering cows and one involved growing vegetables. You would probably pick the second one unless there you got paid a lot more for the first one. But if all labor costs exactly the same thing - if you are paid according to how much you work, no matter what you are making - then there would be no reason ever to pursue a job you really, truly hated. This is why Schliemann feels that socialism will mean the end to unsafe labor practices: because factories will have to attract people to work for them. The power will all be on the side of the worker, not the factory owner. Schliemann predicts that this shift of power will also mean the end to the meatpacking industry as a whole. No one is going to choose to be surrounded by many, many slaughtered animals. In Schliemann's vision of a future world, we'll all be vegetarians. Jurgis overhears two women comment that Schliemann's speech must have converted Mr. Maynard to their cause. If not, then they'll know Mr. Maynard is a fool. The next day is Election Day. Jurgis hurries to a Socialist Party gathering to hear the results. The returns show that, across the board, there are more and more people turning out to vote for a socialist ticket. No city in the country is more actively socialist than Chicago. A speaker addresses the crowd: they must continue to organize! This is their opportunity! They must keep up their momentum! Chicago will be socialist!"

Jurgis attends a meeting with a magazine editor who opposes socialism but has agreed to listen to some proponents of the movement. Jurgis's role is to detail the unsanitary conditions under which meat is packed and sold to the public. Nicholas Schliemann, a fierce socialist, explains that the movement wishes to enact public ownership of the means of production. Once the inefficiency of production is eliminated through science and eradication of graft, no worker will be obliged to labor for countless hours a day merely to survive. He can work as little as two hours a day and devote the rest of his time to his personal interests. The basic goals of socialism are \"common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life. The means to bring about this revolution is to raise the class consciousness of the proletariat around the world through political organization. Later, the socialist party achieves phenomenal victories in the elections across the country. A spirited speaker at a political meeting urges socialists to continue fighting because the victory is not yet won, encouraging them with the words, \"Chicago will be ours"

Strether tells Maria that the last thing Chad told him is that he is \"exciting.\" Strether has never heard anyone call him this before. But Maria says that he excites her all the time. Frisky! Strether looks around Maria's place and says it's peaceful. Maria answers by saying that she wishes it were a place that Strether would like to be peaceful in. Which is about as straightforward as she could be about saying that she wants the two of them to shack up together. But Strether has written to Sarah Pocock and he plans on joining her in her trip back to Woollett. Um, what? At this point, Maria mentions that Strether never told her what the embarrassing object was that the Newsome family made all of their money off. Strether is about to tell her, but then she decides that she'd rather not know. Sheesh, thanks a lot Maria. Maybe some of the rest of us would like to know. Strether also says that he hopes that Chad won't go back to Woollett, and that if he does, it probably won't be for the money. Maria is aghast at the idea of Chad leaving Madame de Vionnet, but Strether admits that it's still a possibility. Strether also admits that even though he is going back to Woollett, things between him and Mrs. Newsome are completely finished. Strether finally mentions what he said to Chad about never leaving Madame. He says that he would curse Chad forever if he did it. And with that, Strether says that he's all tired out and that he really has nothing left to say about Paris or anything else, for that matter.

        "Twenty-six years have passed. Newland Archer is sitting in his library. He has just returned from the opening of the new galleries in the Metropolitan Museum. The memory of the Cesnola galleries reminded him of his talk with Madame Olenska there. Over those years, he has had three children with May: Dallas, Mary, and Bill. May passed away a couple of years ago nursing the youngest child through pneumonia. Mary is married to one of the Chivers's sons. Dallas is working with an architecture firm in Chicago and engaged to be married to Fanny Beaufort, Mr. Julius Beaufort's daughter. Fanny Beaufort has an interesting history. Few remember Beaufort's disaster, and when his wife died, he had married his mistress, Fanny Ring, and they had a daughter, Fanny Beaufort. When the Beauforts died, May's brother and sister-in-law had been appointed her guardian. Fanny has been completely accepted by New York society. Newland Archer has built up a reputation for himself as a \"good citizen.\" He spent a year in politics, and counts the Governor of New York as one of his friends. Mostly he spends his time with philanthropic causes. He receives a phone call from Dallas, who invites him to go to Europe with him. Newland agrees. The day after their arrival in Paris, Dallas informs his father that they have been invited to visit Countess Olenska at 5:30. Dallas promised Fanny that he would visit her since Countess Olenska was so kind to Fanny when Fanny went to a convent school in Paris. Dallas asks his father frankly whether Countess Olenska was his \"Fanny,\" i.e. lover. He tells his father that the day before his mother died, his mother had told him that they would be safe with his father because when she had asked him to give up the one thing he wanted most, he had done so. Archer replies that May never asked. Dallas doesn't think that's unusual, since he's accustomed to his parents silently agreeing on things. While Dallas spends the day at Versailles, Archer visits the Louvre. He remembers the Countess saying she liked the Louvre. Archer and Dallas meet up again at the hotel, and cross the Place des Invalides on the way over to Countess Olenska's together. When they arrive, Archer informs Dallas that he doesn't want to see Countess Olenska after all, and sits outside as Dallas goes inside. He fantasizes about what is going on in Countess Olenska's rooms as he sits outside on a bench and looks up at her open windows. When a servant comes out to close the shutters, Archer gets up and walks back alone to his hotel."

        "Twenty-six years later in a new century, Newland Archer, age 57, is sitting in his library on East 39th Street, having just returned from a ceremony for new galleries in the Metropolitan Museum. He is in a reflective mood, brought about by his memories of meeting the Countess there years ago. In his library he remembers May announcing her pregnancy; their delicate son, Dallas, being christened and later taking his first steps; their daughter, Mary, becoming engaged to one of Reggie Chivers' dull sons and her radiant face as Newland kissed her here on her wedding day; and his conversations with Theodore Roosevelt, a family friend, who stayed overnight. Roosevelt talked Newland into running for public office, as Ned Winsett had often urged him to do. Spending only one term in the State Assembly, Newland has settled into the role of elder statesman, consulted on projects for the city and become involved in philanthropic work. His marriage to May was dull but dignified, and he mourns her sincerely; she had died two years before of the infectious pneumonia through which she had nursed their third child, Bill, back to health. Newland looks at May's first picture, still in its place near the inkstand, and muses that she remained unchanged -- like her photo -- until her death. Even the children hesitated to take away her ingenuous thoughts with their cold, new-century realities. The telephone rings and Newland speaks with Dallas, his architect son who is calling long distance from Chicago. Dallas' voice sounds so close it is amazing, and Newland listens as Dallas asks him to go to Europe with him on a job. Newland's son is to be married on June 5 to Fanny Beaufort, daughter of Julius and Fanny Ring, who married years ago following the death of Regina Beaufort. Times have changed and no one criticizes this union. Newland accompanies his son to Paris. All those years ago, he told Ellen he would see her in Paris, but he never kept that promise. Although he thought of himself as a dashing and romantic figure then, he now realizes he is a middle-aged relic. Ellen never went back to her husband and never married either. The Count died, leaving her a widow, living in Paris. Dallas' fiancee, Fanny, asked him to do several things, one of which was to see the Countess Olenska who had befriended her when she was in school in Europe. So Dallas tells his father he has accepted an invitation for them to call on the countess. He reveals to Newland that he knows the countess was once \"your Fanny.\" Shocked, Newland asks him why he thinks that. Dallas simply states that his dying mother told him that Newland had \"given up the thing most wanted\" and revealed her knowledge of his love for the countess. Newland is stunned to realize that his dutiful and unimaginative wife had known all along, and he is touched that she pitied him for his sacrifice. Dallas leaves to visit Versailles and Newland roams Paris, thinking of the amazing life Ellen must have had there with museums, art galleries, glittering acquaintances, and a freer world than New York City. He visits the Louvre because she probably haunted that art gallery and he thinks of himself at age 57; the sweet love of springtime is no longer possible, but perhaps they could have the mature companionship of autumn. Later that day, Newland and Dallas walk to the Invalides and pause outside Ellen's apartment. The day is fading and the view is peaceful and pleasant. Newland sits down on a bench and convinces Dallas to go up to Ellen's apartment without him, as he wants to sit a few minutes and collect his thoughts. Dallas is more like the young Newland that Ellen will remember from thirty years ago. After his son leaves, Newland imagines what that meeting will be like and realizes, \"It's more real to me here than if I went up.\" The sun slowly goes down and he stands up and walks back to his hotel."

        "More than a week passes, and Archer has still not heard from Ellen since their meeting in the Museum. In the meantime, his law office has settled a generous trust fund for Ellen on the request of Mrs. Mingott. May tells Archer that she wishes to give her first formal dinner in honor of the departure of Countess Olenska. At the dinner, Archer notices that the guests are remarkably kind to Ellen now that she is about to leave. With a start, he realizes that the entire clan assumes that he has been having an affair with Ellen for quite some time. Although the guests are too polite to even allude to the affair, their elaborately feigned innocence is, to Archer, the surest sign that they suspect an infidelity. Suddenly, the dinner seems to be the disguise for a celebratory send-off of a member of the clan who has violated their strict social code. After dinner, Archer gathers with the other gentlemen in his library. Archer is disgusted by the hypocrisy of Larry Lefferts, who self-righteously condemns Beaufort's infidelities despite his own illicit affairs. The guests finally leave, after paying their warmest respects to Ellen. Alone in his library, Archer and May discuss the success of the evening. Archer has again resolved to tell May of his feelings for Ellen, when she reveals to him that she is pregnant. She tells him that she wasn't positive until that morning, but that she had told Ellen in their long conversation two weeks earlier the she was pregnant. It is now twenty-five years later, and the world has changed significantly. Archer is now considered to be a model citizen, a philanthropist, and a dutiful father. We learn that May had died from pneumonia two years earlier, after nursing their youngest child back to health. Archer had remained a dutiful husband throughout the rest of their marriage, and May died no less innocent of the world than at her youth. The memory of Ellen Olenska has kept Archer from pursuing other women. At fifty-seven, he finds himself less adventurous, more inclined to old habits than in his youth, and he is bewildered by the new social freedoms available for his grown children. Archer's eldest son convinces him to accompany him to Paris for a few weeks. Once there, he surprises Archer by informing him that they are to visit the Countess Olenska at her Paris apartment. Archer's son asks him if it was true that he had once been in love with the Countess. The son continues by remarking that May had told him the day before she died that Archer had \"given up the thing he most wanted\" when she had asked him to. Emotionally, Archer responds that she had never asked him. That afternoon, Archer does not join his son in calling on Ellen Olenska. Down on the street below her apartment, he visualizes entering her apartment. He decides that she is more real to him in his imagination than if he went up. As Archer stares up at the apartment balcony, a manservant appears at the window and closes the shutters. As if his cue, Archer returns alone to his hotel."

Frank makes fun of her, calling her \"an old wretch\" and scolding Vivie for pretending to get along with her. Vivie, however, insists that he show her mother more respect. Frank and Vivie's ensuing conversation is flirtatious in a specific way: they play at being children with each other.

He asks Frank to leave. Crofts proposes marriage to Vivie, using the same commercial justification he used with her mother the night before. Whereas Mrs. Warren reacted negatively to this approach, Vivie assures Crofts that she understands and appreciates it. However, she still rejects him, since she does not wish to marry anyone.

Upon learning that Mrs. Warren continues to operate brothels, Vivie becomes sickened.

The servants find it odd that Timon's friends should demand their loans paid back when they still enjoy Timon's gifts. The servants know their lords have sucked up Timon's bounty and now, even worse, have no gratitude for the generosity he showed them in days past. Flaminius and Flavius enter, and the servants demand to know the whereabouts of Timon. Flavius asks them why they didn't bring out their bills of debt due when their lords were enjoying the bounty of Timon's table, instead of presenting them when Timon's luck has turned. Flavius angrily departs. Servilius enters, and the servants assault him with questions, but he explains that Timon has been taken ill. Yet Timon bursts from the house in a rage. He shouts angrily that he has always been free, why should he now be constrained within his house, why now is mankind so cruel to him? Each of the creditor's servants then present their bills, swarming around him. Timon is horrified, and rushes back inside the house, while the servants wonder if their masters may be better off giving up on collecting their money. Inside the house, Timon speaks to Flavius, and suddenly thinks of a plan. He orders Flavius to organize another feast. Flavius says no money remains for a feast, but Timon tells him not to worry. He sends Flavius to invite everyone. Meanwhile in the Senate House, several senators discuss the fate of a man. Alcibiades enters and pleads for his friend. His friend, he says, is an honorable man who acted foolishly out of passion, and asks that he be freed. One senator replies that Alcibiades speaks as if he's trying to make manslaughter legal. Revenge is not a valorous action; rather, learning to bear slights and suffering is preferable, says the senator. Alcibiades then speaks as a soldier, to whom slights mean action. If bearing suffering is valorous, does that mean prisoners are wiser than those who judge them? Alcibiades begs that they consider his friend acted rashly, but doesn't everyone sometimes do the same? The senators say Alcibiades's efforts are in vain. Alcibiades insists that his friend's actions for Athens on the battlefield should be sufficient payment for his freedom.

The girls notice that the men haven't followed them into the house and are eating muffins. They're worried that the guys don't seem to be noticing them at all. A moment later, when the two guys start walking toward the house, the women are affronted and agree to give them the silent treatment. But that soon falls apart. Cecily breaks her silence to ask Algernon why he pretended to be Jack's brother. He answers candidly--to \"have an opportunity of meeting you\" . Cecily melts. Then it's Gwendolen's turn. She asks Jack why he pretended to have a brother. Before he can answer, she suggests that it was possibly so that he could have an excuse to come up to town to see her as often as possible. He confirms it. Satisfied, the girls forgive the men. But there's a still a problem. The girls confront the guys in loud unison: \"Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all!\" . In other words, the girls can't possibly marry them if their names aren't Ernest. In response, the men answer in unison: \"Our Christian names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon\" . Seeing that their beloveds are brave enough to endure such a harrowing ordeal as a christening for their sake, the women rush into their lovers' arms. Merriman enters, sees all the hugging going on, and coughs loudly. He announces the arrival of Lady Bracknell. The startled couples separate. Lady Bracknell loses no time in asking Gwendolen just what she's doing. At the news that she's engaged to Jack, Lady Bracknell turns her wrath on him. She orders that all communication between them must stop immediately and ignores his protests. Then she turns to Algernon and asks if this is where Bunbury resides. Caught by surprise, Algernon answers no, then stutters that Bunbury is actually dead. He died by exploding. Lady Bracknell is appalled by his method of death, considering it a \"revolutionary outrage\" , but is glad that the matter is settled. Onto business. Lady Bracknell asks Jack who is that young person holding Algernon's hand so inappropriately. When she learns Algernon is engaged to Cecily, she comments that there must be something in the air here that is particularly exciting. Because the number of engagements here \"seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance\" . Slyly, she asks if Miss Cardew has any relations to the railway stations in London. Jack is fuming, but coldly answers no and recites Cecily's proper parents, plus their address. He assures her that she can find the same information in the Court Guides. And he lists off all the documentation he has of Cecily--including birth certificates, baptism records, incidents of illness, and vaccinations. Lady Bracknell brushes him off, telling Gwendolen it's time to leave. As they exit, she asks offhand if Miss Cardew has any amount of fortune. Oh, Jack answers, just a hundred and thirty thousand pounds. Lady Bracknell freezes. Suddenly, Cecily looks much more attractive to her. With Cecily's eager cooperation, Lady Bracknell inspects her profile and declares she has \"distinct social possibilities\" . Finally, she gives her consent. She even allows Cecily to call her Aunt Augusta. But Jack has other ideas. As Cecily's legal guardian, he refuses to give consent for her to marry Algernon. When Lady Bracknell, insulted, asks what could possibly be wrong with Algernon, Jack reveals that Algernon has lied--deceiving his whole family into thinking he was the nonexistent younger brother, Ernest. On top of that, Jack continues, he not only drank an entire bottle of his best wine, but also ate every single muffin at tea. Jack stands by his verdict; he won't give Algernon consent to marry Cecily. Lady Bracknell, however, has hope. After learning Cecily is eighteen, Lady Bracknell says it won't be long before she comes of age and she can make her own decisions. But Jack interrupts, saying her grandfather's will dictates she won't come of age until she's thirty-five. Although Lady Bracknell doesn't think the wait is that bad, Cecily is impatient and declares she can't wait that long. Finally, Jack deigns to negotiate: if Lady Bracknell will give consent for him to marry Gwendolen, he'll consent to let Algernon marry Cecily. Lady Bracknell flatly refuses and tells Gwendolen to get ready to go. They've already missed five trains back to town. Dr. Chasuble enters at this crucial moment to announce that everything is ready for the christenings. Lady Bracknell will not hear of such nonsense. Jack sadly agrees to call off the christenings, because there's no point now. Nobody is getting married. This news saddens Dr. Chasuble, but he's glad to have some free time this evening. He's heard that Miss Prism has been waiting for him in the vestry. Lady Bracknell starts at the name. Apparently they have a history. Jack tries to explain that Miss Prism is Cecily's esteemed governess. But this has no impact on Lady Bracknell. She orders Chasuble to send for Miss Prism at once. At the sight of the stern Lady Bracknell, Miss Prism stops dead in her tracks, and turns around with the intention of running away. Prism! Lady Bracknell spits. Miss Prism approaches humbly. Lady Bracknell recites Prism's crime: twenty-eight years ago, Miss Prism left Lord Bracknell's house with a perambulator containing a male child. Both of them disappeared without a trace. Weeks later, the police found the perambulator in Bayswater with an especially sappy three-volume novel inside. But the baby was gone. Prism, Lady Bracknell screeches, where is that baby? Shamed, Miss Prism confesses. She doesn't know where the child is, but she tells what happened the best she can. On that fateful day, she not only had the baby in the perambulator with her, but the prized three-volume novel she had written, contained in an old hangbag. Later that day, she got confused and accidentally put the book into the perambulator and the baby into the handbag. Jack, who's been listening intently, asks where she sent the handbag. Miss Prism confesses she deposited it at a cloakroom in Victoria Station , the Brighton line. At this news, Jack runs up to his room, leaving the others baffled. It sounds like things are being frantically thrown around. After some time, Jack returns with a black leather handbag. He asks Miss Prism to inspect it and decide whether or not it's the one she owned. After a few moments, Miss Prism declares that it is indeed hers. She points to the lock, which is engraved with her initials, as proof. Jack smiles and reveals that he was the baby inside the handbag. Then he impulsively hugs Miss Prism, screaming in joy, \"Mother!\" . But Miss Prism recoils, saying that she is not married. How could he dare insinuate such a thing? But Jack is in a generous mood and forgives her, only to hug her again. Stunned, Miss Prism detaches herself and points to Lady Bracknell. That woman, she says, can tell you who you really are. Lady Bracknell delivers the stunning news. \"You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother\" . Jack is beside himself with joy, glad because this means that he had been telling the truth all these years; he does indeed have a younger brother. He grabs Algy and goes around the room, introducing each and every person to his \"unfortunate brother,\" Algernon. Gwendolen finally asks the question that's been on our minds. What is Jack's real name? He must remember that his marriage depends on it. Jack turns to Lady Bracknell for the answer. She answers that he was indeed christened, and--as befits the eldest son--was named after his father. But, unfortunately, she cannot remember the General's name. Neither can Algy, because their father died when he was a baby. But Jack has an idea. His father's name would appear in the Army Lists, wouldn't it? Jack turns to the bookcase and tears out volumes until he finds the Army List he wants. He flips through the M's until he finds the Moncrieff entry. He reads out the Christian name: Ernest John. He shuts the book and turns to Gwendolen with the suspenseful news that his name really is Ernest. He hasn't been lying after all. Lady Bracknell now remembers that the General's name was Ernest. She knew she had a reason for disliking that name. This clears the way for a love-fest. Gwendolen rushes into Jack's arms. Dr. Chasuble embraces Miss Prism . Algernon sweeps Cecily off her feet. There's general chaotic joy. When Lady Bracknell tries to put a damper on things by saying Jack is \"displaying signs of triviality\" , Jack replies suavely that, on the contrary, \"I've now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\""

        "No time has elapsed, but in Act III Gwendolen and Cecily are in the morning room of the Manor House, looking out the window at Jack and Algernon and hoping they will come in. If they do, the ladies intend to be cold and heartless. The men do come in and start explaining why they lied about their names. The women accept their explanations but still have a problem with them lacking the name Ernest. Both men proclaim that they plan to be rechristened, and Gwendolen and Cecily forgive them, and both couples embrace. Merriman discretely coughs to signal the entrance of Lady Bracknell. She desires an explanation for these hugs, and Gwendolen tells her that she is engaged to Jack. Lady Bracknell says that they are not engaged and insists that they cease all communication. She inquires about Algernon's invalid friend, Bunbury, and Algernon explains that he killed him that afternoon; Bunbury exploded. He also adds that he and Cecily are engaged. Immediately, Lady Bracknell interrogates Jack about Cecily's expectations. However, because she has a fortune of 130,000 pounds, Lady Bracknell believes her to have \"distinct social possibilities.\" Lady Bracknell gives her consent to Algernon's engagement, but Jack immediately objects as Cecily's guardian. He says that Algernon is a liar and lists all the lies he has told. Also, Cecily does not come into her fortune and lose Jack as a guardian until she is 35 years old. Algernon says he can wait, but Cecily says she cannot. So Jack, in a moment of brilliance, declares that he will agree to the marriage if Lady Bracknell will consent to his engagement to Gwendolen. That is out of the question, and Lady Bracknell prepares to leave with Gwendolen. Dr. Chasuble arrives and announces that he is ready for the christenings. Jack replies that they are useless now, and Chasuble decides to head back to the church where Miss Prism is waiting. The name Prism shocks Lady Bracknell, and she demands to see the governess. When Miss Prism arrives, she sees Lady Bracknell and turns pale. In a moment of great coincidence, Lady Bracknell reveals that Miss Prism left Lord Bracknell's house 28 years ago. On a normal walk with the baby carriage, she disappeared, along with the baby. She demands to know where the baby is. Prism explains that in a moment of great distraction, she placed the baby in her handbag and her three-volume, manuscript in the baby carriage. The baby and handbag were accidentally left in the train station. When she discovered her error, she abandoned the baby carriage and disappeared. Jack excitedly asks her which station it was, and when she reveals that it was Victoria Station, the Brighton Line, he runs from the room and returns with a black leather bag. When Prism identifies it, he embraces her, believing her to be his mother. She protests that she is not married and says that he will have to ask Lady Bracknell for the identity of his mother. Jack discovers that he is actually the son of Lady Bracknell's sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and that Algy is his older brother. Jack is overcome to know that he really does have an unfortunate scoundrel for a brother. He asks what his christened name was, and Lady Bracknell explains that it is Ernest John. So, Jack asserts that he had been speaking the truth all along: His name is Ernest, and he does have a brother. Both couples embrace, as do Chasuble and Miss Prism, and Jack declares that he finally realizes the importance of being earnest."

        "In this short, concluding chapter, Adams briefly mentions scientific power and politics, but despite the forward-looking chapter title, Nunc Age , his focus really is on the past and on endings. On November 5, 1904, as he approaches New York City, returning from yet another trip to Europe, Henry is excited by the vitality of the great city, which \"became frantic in its effort to explain something that defied meaning. Power seemed to have outgrown its servitude and to have asserted its freedom.\" This is the age that he has anticipated in the last third of the Education, but he leaves the work of the future to the next generation. Adams feels that he and his contemporaries are near the end. Clarence King died -- broken -- in 1901; John Hay is in poor shape and, despite Henry's efforts, dies on July 1, 1905. Three days later, Henry writes to Mrs. Hay to express condolences and reflect on the twilight of his own life: \"I had not the heart to telegraph. All the world will have done that, and will have overwhelmed you with messages of condolence. I can say nothing. You will understand it. . . . As for me, it is time to bid good-bye. I am tired. My last hold on the world is lost with him.\" Adams has privately printed the Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres in 1904; the first private edition of the Education will come out in 1907. He will write a little more in the next few years, but he suffers a disabling stroke in 1912 and dies on March 27, 1918. However, the story of the education of the boy from Boston stops in 1905. Henry wonders, at the end, whether he and his old friends may be allowed to return just for one day -- in 1938, say, their centenary -- to see the \"mistakes of their own lives made clear in the light of the mistakes of their successors.\" He wistfully wonders if it will be, for the first time in history, a world that \"sensitive and timid natures could regard without a shudder.\" For once, Henry's speculation seems wrong. With Hitler leading the Third Reich into World War II, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki soon to come, 1938 will be no time for timid natures. But having completed this journey with him, the reader knows that Henry already suspects something like that.

        "Families are made up of people closely related to one another. When the women grow up, they are married out, but the males continue to live in the same house. The oldest man is head of the family. No city contains more than six thousand families, and each family has between ten and sixteen people in it, excluding children. If a city becomes overpopulated, some families are moved to underpopulated areas. If the population of the whole country grows too much, then some people are sent to colonize the neighboring mainland. If the native population resist, the Utopians will use force, on the grounds that every person has a right to cultivate soil that would otherwise be wasteland. If the population on Utopia drops, some colonists are recalled. Within the family, wives are subservient to their husbands, and children to their parents. Younger people are subservient to older ones. Every city is divided into four sections, and each has a market place at the center, where people bring the food and goods that they produce. Each father goes and takes whatever he needs for his family, without having to pay for it. No one takes more than he needs, since there are no shortages. Outside the towns is a place near running water where animals are butchered for meat. This is done by slaves, since it is believed that butchering animals has a negative effect on character. The Utopians do not allow anything unclean to be brought into the towns, lest it cause disease. In each street is a great hall where the Syphogrant lives. Each Syphogrant presides over thirty families. Those thirty families meet and dine together in the great hall. The meals are skillfully prepared by the women of the families, who take it in turn to cook. Menial kitchen tasks are performed by slaves. Each town has four hospitals, and the Utopians take better care of their sick than any other nation. At the communal meals, children under five sit separately with the nurses. Older children up to marriageable age serve their elders. Young people are seated near older people, as this is thought to have a good influence on their behavior. Dinner and supper begin with a lecture on morality, but it is kept short. In the country, everyone eats in their own homes because of the large distance between houses."

        "In the secret garden, Colin continues to stand up straight and can even walk. Ben Weatherstaff enters the garden and Colin draws attention to himself, demanding to know from Ben if he sees him as a hunchback. Ben responds that he is not, and that everyone has been a fool to believe that Colin would die. Ben tells Colin about how the garden belonged to Mrs. Craven, his mother. Colin declares that now it is his and that it must be left a secret. Ben reveals that he has been in the secret garden before by climbing over the wall, which explains how the roses in the garden look pruned. As the sun goes down, Ben Weatherstaff presents Colin with a potted rose, which Colin plants in the soil himself. When Colin returns for the night, Dr. Craven warns him to minimize his time spent outside, and Colin responds defiantly that he will be going out every day and that he can't be stopped. Mary notices Colin's rude way of ordering around people and tells him directly that he could have better manners. Colin is surprised to hear that he behaves in this strange way, but he vows to keep visiting the garden, where he will be transformed by Magic. In the following months, many magical things take place in the garden as the flowers start budding. Colin continues to spend time there every day, watching things grow. Colin believes that it is the Magic that allowed him to stand for the first time in the garden. One day, Colin calls over Ben Weatherstaff, Mary, and Dickon to declare that when he grows up he will be a scientist who studies Magic. He proposes they do an experiment where every day they each affirm that Magic is inside of them and is making them well and to observe the results. They then sit cross-legged in a circle under the tree to start the experiment. Colin repeats a chant about how Magic lives through all of life, including in them. They then form a procession through the garden where Colin continues to declare that Magic is making him strong. He has made himself believe that he is not sick anymore and imagines what his father would think when he sees him well. The children continue to do these ceremonies regularly. Dickon starts working at another garden near his cottage. His mother, Mrs. Sowerby, enjoys going out to this garden and talking to the boy. There, Dickon divulges to her all the things that have been happening at Misselthwaite Manor and she becomes in on the secret. Mrs. Sowerby offers to prepare the children milk and bread to enjoy during their days in the garden, in order to help Colin and Mary fatten up. Dr. Craven and the nurses are beginning to notice Colin's increased appetite, so he can't ask for more food. He tries to not make himself seem too healthy, as he doesn't want anyone to find out about the secret garden and interfere with the children's daily routine. When the doctor proposes writing to Colin's father to tell him of his improving health, Colin panics and considers he might have to start eating less in order to discourage Dr. Craven. Mary and Colin find it difficult to eat less, however, because their appetites are growing each day. Thus they are delighted to receive the food from Mrs. Sowerby. Not wanting to put too much pressure on Dickon's mother to feed them, they also create a tiny oven in a hollow near the garden, in which the children cook potatoes and eggs. Becoming stronger, Colin is able to stand and walk more and more. The manor staff are perplexed at how the children can grow so strong and look so healthy while eating so little. The garden is blooming more and more and the robins are hatching eggs, which is described as a miracle. The robin's perspective is given, where he reveals that he trusts Dickon around the eggs but not necessarily Colin and Mary. The robins observe Colin learning to walk and conclude that the boy is learning to fly. On a rainy day, Mary and Colin amuse themselves by exploring the unused rooms in the mansion. Their playing causes them to have a great appetite and they both finish their lunches for the first time in awhile, much to the happiness of the staff. Later, Mary notices that Colin has removed the curtain from his mother's portrait in his room. Colin continues to lecture the children and Ben Weatherstaff about Magic, even while they are at work weeding in the garden. One day, Ben suggests Dickon sing the \"Doxology,\" a hymn which praises God and all His creatures. As the children sing the hymn, a woman with affectionate eyes and a long blue cloak enters. It is Dickon's mother. She is surprised and happy to see Colin so well. She is also shocked because of the uncanny resemblance Colin bears to his own mother. She also notices how much Mary has grown healthier. The children ask her if she believes in Magic, to which she says yes, calling it the \"Big Good Thing\" in which they must always put their faith. The last chapter starts with narration about how the power of thoughts will be discovered and better understood in the 20th century. For instance, a bad thought can negatively affect the body just as much as a disease. This is shown through the characters of Mary and Colin. The narrator speaks of Mr. Craven, who for 10 years has thought only negatively and has not had the courage to be more positive, even while traveling throughout beautiful places in Europe. One day, while sitting by a stream in Austria, he starts thinking of the site's beauty and he suddenly feels alive for the first time in years. He can't maintain this new hope all the time, but he feels over the next few days that his usual sense of burden periodically lifts. One night, Mr. Craven dreams of hearing Mrs. Craven's voice calling to him, telling him that she is in their special garden. The next day, he receives a letter from Mrs. Sowerby advising him to come home, and that Mrs. Craven would want him to come if she were alive. Mr. Craven makes the journey back, thinking of Colin in a way he hasn't in years. He reflects on how he has not been the best father to Colin, avoiding him because of his resemblance to his wife. As he arrives back at the manor, he thinks about how he will find the key to the secret garden. Mrs. Medlock updates Mr. Craven on Colin's new behaviors and habit of going outdoors every single day. Mr. Craven hurriedly goes to the secret garden. Outside its walls he is surprised to hear commotion and laughter of children. All of a sudden, Colin bursts out of the garden door and bumps directly into his father. Mr. Craven is astonished yet happy to see Colin standing, looking healthy and vibrant. Colin takes him into the garden and tells him everything: about the Magic, the creatures, and his new friends. Mr. Craven laughs and cries with joy at hearing his son's story. The manor servants are completely shocked when they see out the window a healthy-looking Colin and his father walking together towards the house."

Both Mary and Colin began to improve when their selfish, dark thoughts were replaced with positive thinking. Meanwhile, as these two have been improving their minds in the Secret Garden, Mr. Craven has been wandering around Europe. He has seen many beautiful places, but none of these regions have made any difference to his deep sadness. Yet suddenly--at just the same time that Colin is shouting, \"I am going to live forever and ever and ever!\" back in the Secret Garden--Mr. Craven begins to feel some burden lifting from him. One night, as he is dreaming, he hears the voice of his wife calling him from the garden. That day, he gets a letter from Mrs. Sowerby saying that his wife would want to come home. So Mr. Craven travels back to Misselthwaite Manor right away. All of this time, Mr. Craven has been thinking that Colin is basically a vicious brat, \"so like and yet so horribly unlike\" his dead wife. When he arrives at the Manor, he sends for Mrs. Medlock and asks how Colin is. Mrs. Medlock's report is so confused that Mr. Craven thinks Colin has become worse. But as soon as Mr. Craven hears that Colin is in the garden, he walks out there immediately. He hears the sound of running feet and laughing children, and he thinks that he is in a dream as a tall boy runs through the door of the \"locked\" garden. Of course, it's Colin--he's just beaten Mary in a race. Colin leads Mr. Craven into the Secret Garden and tells his father everything that's been happening. And as Mr. Craven and Colin walk back to the house, Colin finally gives up his wheelchair to show that he can walk as well as any kid in Yorkshire."

The narrator also says that only the courageous are able to do this; Master Craven, by contrast, has not been courageous&mdashhis mind is still full of his grief. The narrator finds Master Craven in the Austrian Tyrol, having \"forgotten and deserted his home and his duties.\" At first, the natural landscape does nothing to soothe his anguish. Then his eye comes to rest on a cluster of flowers&mdashforget-me-nots&mdashand he finds himself marveling at their beauty. Looking at them, he feels \"almost alive.\" Back at Misselthwaite, the garden too is coming alive&mdashand Master Craven is coming alive with it. His body and soul begin to become still stronger during his time in Italy, at Lake Como, where he goes after his departure from Austria. One night, he dreams of the Mistress Craven; she is calling his name and asking him to come find her in their garden. The next morning, he receives a letter from Susan Sowerby, advising him to come back to Misselthwaite at once: he must see Colin, she says, as his late wife would want him to. She does not explain why. Archibald immediately makes preparations to return home by rail. On the journey to England, Master Craven muses about his son and his history: he thinks of the way he has neglected Colin, for he has never felt at all like the father of such an hysteric. He thinks of the way Colin's eyes&mdashso like and yet so horribly unlike his mother's&mdashfill him with aversion. And yet, he remains serene, and resolves to at least try to rectify his relationship with his son upon his return. Master Craven is much pleased by his return to moor, and stops at Susan Sowerby's house to make a tiny gift to her children. At the manor, he immediately sets off for the garden to look for his son, as Mrs. Medlock says that he will find Colin there. He is astonished to hear sounds of children running and laughing, coming from beyond the secret garden's wall. Suddenly, the door is flung open, and Colin tumbles out into his father's arms. Master Craven, ecstatic to find him healthy, embraces Colin, and asks his son to show him around the secret garden. Colin does so, and tells him the entire story of its discovery and its reawakening. The three of them&mdashColin, Mary, and Master Craven&mdashwalk back to the manor house. Each and every person is utterly astounded by Archibald's happiness and Colin's vigor, now that it is no longer a secret."

The men comment on Pegeen's infatuation with Christy, who has routed every competitor on the beach. Though they acknowledge his skill as an athlete, they are annoyed by his incessant bragging over his heroic deed. They then discuss a collection of skulls on display in Dublin. Old Mahon enters to hear their talk, and shows them his own skull injury. When he attributes it to his good-for-nothing son, the men grow suspicious and ask for more detail. Mahon promises to oblige if they feed him supper, and reveals that he has been earning bed and board in exchange for the story of his son's attack. Widow Quin enters to find them in conversation, and she quickly separates them from one another. After giving Old Mahon a drink, she confides to Jimmy and Philly that Mahon is raving. She tells them how he had initially attributed his head fracture to a tinker's blow, but has changed his story after hearing tell of Christy's deed. Meanwhile, Mahon grows maudlin, lamenting his son's betrayal. Finding him credible, Jimmy and Philly ask for more detail about the son. However, the widow slyly interjects by asking Mahon whether his son was a great athlete. Naturally, Mahon denies that claim, insisting the boy is a mangy cur. Suddenly, they hear the crowd roaring from the beach. Though the sound pierces Mahon's aching head, he is curious about the commotion, and joins Jimmy and Philly to watch a tremendously exciting mule race in the distance. They all exclaim over the skill of the race champion, and then note that the crowd is carrying him towards the pub. When he recognizes this champion as Christy, Mahon cries out in shock. The widow insists his perception has been obscured by his injury, since his son could never have achieved such a victory. Confused, Mahon concedes the point, and insists he must check himself into an insane asylum, admitting that he has spent time there in the past. He exits, followed by Jimmy and Philly, who remain suspicious of the widow's story. As he is carried in by the crowd, overcome with prizes, Christy boasts that his mule race victory is nothing compared to his heroic murder. Pegeen proudly tends to Christy as the crowd disperses to watch the final event down on the beach. Once they are alone, Christy declares his wish to wed Pegeen in a fortnight. Pegeen hedges, insinuating he is a skirt-chaser. He rejects this suggestion, wooing her poetically and tenderly in the process. She softens, speaking tenderly in turn. Finally, Pegeen consents to marriage, noting how fortunate it is that she already has a dress. Michael, still drunk, enters with Shawn. Death still on his mind from the wake, Michael chastises Christy for having deprived his father of a Christian burial. Shawn then announces that he has received Father Reilly's dispensation, and that Michael has consented to have him and Pegeen married today. Michael adds that he does not want to leave Pegeen alone any longer with a reprobate like Christy. Pegeen defies her father by declaring her plan to marry Christy. Horrified his daughter would prefer a father-killer to a decent Christian, Michael urges Shawn to challenge Christy. Shawn's cowardly refusal to stand up for himself only hardens Pegeen against him. Shawn does tries to argue his case, citing the ring he has already bought, the promise he has made to give the family heifers, and the church's permission, but Pegeen remains unmoved. Christy threatens to murder Shawn if he persists, and Michael grows incensed at the suggestion, adding that he cannot allow a murder in his pub, especially since he has stocked so much illegal moonshine for the night's celebration. He encourages the men to bring their battle down to the beach, but Shawn remains steadfast in his refusal to fight. Michael reassesses the situation: If the goal of marriage is to procreate, then better Pegeen should procreate with brave Christy than create any small replicas of the cowardly Shawn. Convinced, Michael gives his blessing to Pegeen and Christy by bringing their hands together. They hear a hubbub outside, and then Old Mahon bursts in, followed by the crowd and Widow Quin. Mahon rushes at Christy, who cowers before his father's blows. Pegeen intervenes in the fight, and Old Mahon reveals that he is Christy's father. Pegeen immediately renounces Christy, who desperately claims that Mahon is a lunatic, and turns to Widow Quin to validate the lie. But Widow Quin can no longer hide the truth, and the crowd roars with pleasure at seeing Christy's lie unravel. Christy begs mercy for a moment, but then, in a sudden and lyrical expression of his fate, he accepts his own lowliness. Unfit for happiness, he could never endure the terrible splendor of a girl like Pegeen. Covering her tears, Pegeen urges Mahon to take his son away before she sets the town's boys on him. Her manner is derisive and desperate. As Mahon struggles to drag Christy away, the crowd eggs on the fight, until Christy turns on them, brandishing a spade. They back away gingerly, jeering in amusement that Christy has gone mad. Mahon goads his son once again, and Christy chases him from the building, the spade raised high. Everyone rushes out, following Christy. Offstage, there is a great yell, followed be silence. A dazed Christy stumbles back in, followed by the Widow Quin, who warns that he must leave at once since the crowd has turned on him. However, Christy refuses, hoping that Pegeen will want him again now that he has truly killed his father. The widow counters that there are woman like Pegeen all over the country, but he is unmoved. Sara runs in and removes her petticoats, hoping Christy will wear them as a makeshift disguise. However, Christy threatens the two women with a stool, and the widow suggests they should fetch the doctor since the man has clearly gone mad. They leave him alone. From the doorway, Michael, Philly, Shawn and Pegeen strategize how to trap Christy in a loop of rope. A frightened Shawn refuses to participate, so the others enter together and land the rope around his arms. Caught, Christy asks Pegeen how she feels about him now that he has actually committed the parricide. Pegeen answers: \"I'll say, a strange man is a marvel, with his mighty talk; but what's a squabble in your back yard, and the blow of a loy, have taught me that there's a great gap between a gallous story and a dirty deed\" . In other words, the act is far less attractive in reality than it is in a story. She then instructs the men to take Christy away, lest they all go on trial for his crime. Christy begs for mercy and release, promising to run away and live like a wild man in the rough. They pull the rope tighter, and Pegeen threatens to burn his legs in the fire. In a speech of elevated language, Christy threatens to kill them before he's hanged. As he writhes on the floor, he bites at Shawn's leg, laughing. He proudly anticipates Satan's welcome once he reaches hell, for none too many have \"killed their da\" in County Mayo . Unnoticed, Old Mahon crawls in on all fours. As Christy struggles, Pegeen burns his leg with a sod and they drag him along the floor until he comes face to face with his father. Christy asks his father if he has come to be a killed a third time, but Mahon merely inquires why he is tied up. Michael apologetically explains that they must bring Christy to the authorities in order to protect themselves from charges of criminal activity. Mahon responds that he cares nothing for what happens to Michael and this crew, but that he and his son will certainly amuse themselves for years to come with stories of Mayo's villainy. Mahon loosens Christy's bonds, and order his son to leave with him. Christy agrees, but insists that he will be the \"gallant captain\" and his father the \"heathen slave\" . He pushes Old Mahon, warning that he himself is the boss now, and the dazed older man wonders whether he has gone \"crazy again,\" so strange is his son's aggressive behavior . Christy thanks the assembled group, explaining that from this day forward, he will go \"romancing through a romping lifetime\" . Then, he and his father exit. Shawn approaches Pegeen, overjoyed that they can now wed. As he complains about the bite on his leg, Pegeen boxes his ears and sends him out of her sight. In a flurry, mostly to herself, Pegeen laments Christy's departure, crying wildly, \"Oh, my grief, I've lost him surely. I've lost the only Playboy of the Western World\" ."

Bosola cuts to the chase: \"I'm here to kill you.\" The Cardinal, knowing that killing people is kind of Bosola's specialty, freaks out and starts screaming for help. Finally, something goes Bosola's way: Pescara, Malateste, and the other men are upstairs and can plainly hear the Cardinal having a conniption fit, but remember his previous order not to come even if he's screaming bloody murder, so they stay put. After a bit, though, Pescara figures that something bad is actually going down, and so he ventures out to help the Cardinal. The others follow to watch the Cardinal laugh at Pescara's inability to follow instructions. After killing the Cardinal's servant, Bosola wounds the Cardinal, who doesn't seem to understand why Bosola would want to kill him. Bosola continues to stab the Cardinal when Ferdinand comes in. At this point, things just become kind of farcical--Ferdinand both a) has no idea what's going and b) is still totally cray, and so after babbling a bit he both wounds his own brother further and, totally by accident, deals a mortal wound to Bosola. Bosola kills Ferdinand, as the latter cries out about ambition and his sister and death. Geez, finally. The noblemen upstairs finally get into the room, and are pretty shocked at what they find. Bosola claims that he's completing his revenge for the Duchess, Antonio, Julia, and himself. The Cardinal dies. After painting a bleak picture of the world as a \"shadow, or deep pit of darkness\" , Bosola dies. Delio comes in with Antonio and the Duchess's son, only to find that he's way too late to the Blood and Guts Party to be of any use. He closes the play by telling the assorted noblemen that they have to try to make the best of the tragedy, and that they've got to establish the eldest son--now the only surviving member of the entire family--as the heir to his mother's position and her integrity."

Vincentio knocks on Lucentio's door, which the Pedant answers. When Vincentio claims to be Lucentio's father, the Pedant denies this and insists that he himself is Lucentio's father. A heated argument ensues and escalates as Vincentio sees Lucentio's servants, Biondello and Tranio, complicit in the deception. Vincentio beats Biondello and accuses Tranio of murdering and impersonating Lucentio. Petruchio and Kate, meanwhile, step aside and enjoy the unfolding farce. Tranio and Baptista call for an officer, claiming that Vincentio is mad, and the controversy rages until Lucentio and Bianca return from their hasty wedding. Seeing that their game is finally up, Tranio, the Pedant, and Biondello all scatter away. Lucentio pleads for his father's forgiveness, explaining the situation to him and assuring him of Tranio's innocence in the matter. Though still fuming, Vincentio grants his approval of Lucentio and Bianca's union and assures Baptista: \"Fear not, we will content you.\" The scene ends with Kate bantering with Petruchio and granting him a reluctant kiss. In the play's final scene, the assembled company enjoys a banquet in Lucentio's home. There are three newlywed couples - Kate and Petruchio, Lucentio and Bianca and Hortensio and the Widow. The women leave and Baptista remarks that Petruchio has married \"the veriest shrew of all.\" Petruchio heartily disagrees, and proposes a wager - the men agree on a hundred crowns - to determine \"whose wife is most obedient.\" Both Hortensio and Lucentio bid their wives to come as part of the bargain, and both wives refuse. The one wife who does follow the order is, to all but Petruchio's surprise, Katharina. Petruchio, to prove the point even further, asks Katharina to bring forth the other two wives, which she promptly does. Petruchio then requests that she \"tell these headstrong women/What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\" Katharina does as asked, delivering a long speech on a wife's duty to her husband."

Jaques tells him, \"A fool, a fool, I met a fool i'th' forest, / A motley fool - a miserable world. As I do live by food, I met a fool\". Jaques describes meeting a man who lay on the ground and pulled out his watch. The fool commented that it was ten o'clock, that an hour before it had been nine, and in one hour it would be eleven. Jaques found the man to be so funny that he spent an hour laughing. He finally tells the Duke, \"O that I were a fool\". The Duke tells Jaques that he would only insult people if he had the license of a fool. Jaques claims that he would be witty and that men would only be insulted if they had done something for which they deserved to be insulted. He is interrupted by Orlando who enters with a drawn sword. Orlando rushes in and cries out, \"Forbear, and eat no more. He orders the men to give him food. The Duke politely bids Orlando to sit down and join them. He is taken aback by the Dukes reply and comments, \"Pardon me, I pray you. I thought that all things had been savage here\". Orlando then asks them to wait for him to get Adam so the old man may eat first. The Duke tells him they will not touch any of the food until he returns. Duke Senior remarks that the whole universe \"presents more woeful pageants than the scene / Wherein we play in\". Jaques replies with his famous speech starting: \"All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. And one man in his time plays many parts, His act being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then, a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, . The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, . and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange, eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. After Jaques' speech, Orlando arrives bearing Adam on his shoulders and sets the older man down. Both of them thank the Duke for his hospitality.

        "Meanwhile, Duke Senior and his band of merry men are readying to settle down to dinner and they're looking for Jaques. Jaques arrives and, shockingly, he's in a good mood. Jaques says he ran into a \"motley fool\" in the forest. Hmm. Sounds like Jaques bumped into Touchstone out in the woods, don't you think? Apparently, Jaques hung out with the \"motley fool\" for about an hour and was amused by the guy's philosophical musings on the passage of time and the nature of women. Jaques bags on Touchstone and says that fools are the only people allowed to mock others without getting into trouble. Brain Snack: Jaques is talking about the freedom of being a \"licensed fool\" . A licensed fool is a guy who literally has a license to say whatever he wants without getting into trouble . Paid fools were pretty common in the households of royalty and the nobility in Shakespeare's day. Jaques says if he were a licensed fool, he could point out everybody's flaws and cure \"th'infected world\" of all its problems. Duke Senior's not buying any of it--he points out that Jaques is more likely to infect the entire world than to cure it. As Jaques responds to the Duke's insult, Orlando bursts in on the dinner party and yells \"Forebear, and eat no more!\" Jaques calls Orlando a \"cock\" and Duke Senior asks whether Orlando is distressed or just raised to have no manners. Orlando is hell-bent on stabbing somebody if they eat, though the Duke insists he should take it easy. Orlando can't take it easy, because he and Adam are starving. Still, he does apologize, saying everything in the forest is so brutish, he must have become brutish himself. The Duke understands, and he invites Orlando to eat with them. Everyone promises to wait while Orlando runs off to get Adam. Duke Senior takes the opportunity to comment that misery seems to be a universal experience. Jaques delivers the play's most famous speech and declares, \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\" He goes on to detail the seven ages of man, as follows: You start as an infant, then a whining schoolboy, progress to a lover, then a soldier, then a contented middle-aged man, followed by a kinda-old guy with spectacles, and finally a very, very old guy who has lost his senses and looks and acts like a helpless baby again. Just as Jaques is saying that old men are like infants, Orlando enters carrying his old servant, Adam... who is as helpless as a baby. The Duke doesn't want to bother them with questions before eating, so they all feast . Amiens sings a song about how even the harsh winter wind isn't as terrible as the way human beings can sometimes treat each other. During the song, Orlando whispers to Duke Senior that he is the son of Sir Rowland de Boys. The Duke recognizes old man Rowland's features in the boy and is delighted to have him. Duke Senior was a good friend of Sir Rowland, so he says Orlando and Adam are welcome in his cave anytime. The Duke says he wants to hear the story of how Adam and Orlando ended up homeless and hungry in the forest."

        "Duke Senior, Rosalind's father, who is searching for Jaques, arrives on the scene and unexpectedly meets Jaques. Jaques describes, with evident delight, his meeting with Touchstone. He says that he wishes that he were a \"fool\" so that he might be able \"as the wind, / To blow on whom I please,\" exercising the fool's prerogative of speaking his mind freely to expose the world's abuses. But Jaques, as the duke notes, has a libertine past; this hardly qualifies him to reproach others for their failings. Their discussion abruptly ends when Orlando enters with his sword drawn. \"Forbear,\" he cries, \"and eat no more\" -- although the meal has scarcely begun. Orlando is calmed by the duke's courteous welcome, and he apologizes and sheathes his sword. Then, begging the duke to put off dining until his return, he goes to fetch Adam. This episode inspires Jaques' account of the seven ages of man. This extended philosophical statement has since become one of the most celebrated speeches in the Shakespearean canon. Most learned people in the Western world recognize the lines \"All the world's a stage / And all the men and women merely players.\" The point of view of the speech is colored by Jaques' cynicism, yet the speech itself has such imaginative power that it transcends Jaques' melancholy and causes one to pause and contemplate this schematic evaluation of man. According to Jaques, these are the seven ages of man: the infant: \"mewling and puking in the nurse's arms . . . \" the schoolboy: \"whining . . . with his satchel / And shining morning face, creeping like a snail, / Unwilling to school.\" the lover: \"sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad . . . to his mistress' eyebrow.\" the soldier: \"full of strange oaths . . . bearded . . . / Jealous in honour, sudden, and quick in quarrel, / Seeking the bubble's reputation / Even in the cannon's mouth.\" the justice : \"in fair round belly with good capon lin'd . . . eyes severe and beard of formal cut, / Full of wise saws and modern instances .\" the dotard : \"lean and slipper'd . . . / With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, / His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide / For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, / Turning again toward childish treble, pipes / And whistles in his sound. the senile, sick elder: \" second childishness and mere oblivion, / Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\" Despite Jaques' surface cynicism, Shakespeare's poetry is impressively sensitive and beautiful. This is Shakespeare at his most brilliant best. Orlando returns, just as Jaques finishes; he is carrying Adam, and as they begin eating, Amiens sings \"Blow, blow, thou winter wind.\" When the song ends, Duke Senior warmly welcomes \"the good Sir Roland's son\" and welcomes Adam as well. The scene ends happily; the duke takes old Adam's hand, and the group sets off for the duke's cave."

        "And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,And then from hour to hour we rot and rot;And thereby hangs a tale. Duke Senior returns to camp to find that Jaques has disappeared. When a lord reports that Jaques has last been seen in good spirits, the duke worries that happiness in one who is typically so miserable portends discord in the universe. Just after the duke commands the lord to find Jaques, Jaques appears. He is uncharacteristically merry and explains that while wandering through the forest, he met a fool. He repeats the fool's witty observations about Lady Fortune and proclaims that he himself would like to be a fool. In this position, Jaques reasons, he would be able to speak his mind freely, thereby cleansing \"the foul body of th'infected world\" with the \"medicine\" of his criticism. The duke laments the sin of \"chiding sin\" and reminds Jaques that he himself is guilty of many of the evils he would inevitably criticize in others. Their playful argument is interrupted when Orlando barges onto the scene, drawing his sword and demanding food. The duke asks whether Orlando's rudeness is a function of distress or bad breeding and, once Orlando has regained his composure, invites him to partake of the banquet. Orlando goes off to fetch Adam. Duke Senior observes that he and his men are far from alone in their unhappiness: there is much strife in the world. Jaques replies that the world is a stage and \"all the men and women merely players\". All humans pass through the stages of infancy, childhood, and adulthood; they experience love and seek honor, but all eventually succumb to the debility of old age and \"mere oblivion\". Orlando returns with Adam and all begin to eat. The duke soon realizes that Orlando is the son of Sir Rowland, the duke's old friend, and heartily welcomes the young man"
