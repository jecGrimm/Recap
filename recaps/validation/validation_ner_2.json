Exhausted, Huck falls asleep until the next morning. When he wakes up, he runs into Uncle Silas, and the two of them go back to the Phelps farm, which is full of local men discussing the strange cabin and its contents. The farmers decide that Jim must have been helped by several slaves and the writing is some sort of \"secret African\" language. The next day, Tom and Jim arrive at the Phelps' with the doctor and several of the farmers. Tom is on a mattress and Jim has his hands tied. The men argue whether or not to hang Jim, and the doctor explains how Jim helped with Tom instead of running away. The next morning Tom wakes up and begins to tell Aunt Sally how he and \"Tom\" orchestrated the entire escape. Tom relishes the retelling until he hears that Jim is still in captivity. Tom rises up in bed and demands that they free Jim because he has known all along that Miss Watson had died and set Jim free in her will. At that moment, Aunt Polly arrives, and Tom and Huck are forced to reveal their true identities.",

The boy is brought in semi-conscious on a mattress, accompanied by a crowd including Jim, in chains, and the doctor. Some of the local men would like to hang Jim but are unwilling to risk having to compensate Jim's master. They treat Jim roughly and chain him hand and foot inside the shed. The doctor intervenes, telling the crowd how Jim has sacrificed his freedom to help nurse Tom. Sally, meanwhile, stays at Tom's bedside, glad that his condition has improved. Tom wakes and gleefully details how they set Jim free. Horrified to learn that Jim is now in chains, Tom explains that Miss Watson died two months ago and that her will stipulated that Jim should be set free. The old woman regretted ever having considered selling Jim down the river. Just then, Aunt Polly walks into the room. She has come to Arkansas from St. Petersburg after receiving a letter from Sally mentioning that Sid Sawyer--Tom's alias--had arrived with \"Tom\"--who was actually Huck. Tom has been intercepting communications between the sisters, and Polly has been forced to appear in person to sort out the confusion. After a tearful reunion with Sally, she identifies Tom and Huck and yells at both boys for their misadventures"

        "Ethan has a tiny study on the first floor, done up in humble imitation of the study of a minister who was kind to him in Worcester. Since Mattie came and he moved the stove up to her room, it has been uninhabitable during the winter. He carries with him a tiny note written by Mattie and left for him on the kitchen table: \"Don't trouble, Ethan\". He begins a farewell letter to Zeena. Zeena will not be able to sell the farm for any considerable sum, and she has no means to survive in the mean time. And as for him and Mattie, they don't even have enough money to get out West. Ethan falls asleep in the study despite the cold. A coach is going to come later in the day to pick up Mattie's heavy trunk, and Jotham is going to take Mattie to the station when he goes to pick up the new hired girl. Ethan heads toward town, humiliated by his own powerlessness. He suddenly considers a new plan: if he tells Andrew Hale that he needs money to hire a girl to help Zeena, he could use the cash advance to flee west with Mattie. Mrs. Hale is the rider, and she talks to Ethan sympathetically about Zeena's latest health problems. She admires Ethan for taking care of Zeena and before her, his mother. The sleigh takes off, and Ethan keeps on toward the Hales': if they feel sorry for him, they're sure to loan him the money. But then Ethan realizes that he is planning to use the compassion of the Hales' to get money dishonestly. He realizes the truth of his situation: Zeena cannot fend for herself, and Ethan's flight with Mattie would depend on deceiving the Hales.",
        "Ethan has a little make-shift study that he hadn't used in a while be because the heater that previously heated it was given to Mattie for her room. When Zeena was safely sleeping, Ethan headed to that room. He and Mattie hadn't talked after the scene, but when he'd come in from doing his final chores he found a note left by Mattie before she went to bed. It said, \"Don't trouble, Ethan.\" This was his first note ever from Mattie. Wrestling with his mind, Ethan decides he can have happiness. Ethan had met the couple and seen their cute little baby. He decides to write Zeena a letter and then leave with Mattie the next day. The farm isn't worth anything to sell, and there is no way Zeena could do any of the work on it. Crushed, Ethan learns that he can't even afford the cheapest ticket, and nobody would loan him any money. He cries and falls asleep thinking of how he and Mattie were supposed to sled tonight. When he wakes up, he realizes it's Mattie's final day on the farm. Mattie is waiting for him. Ethan touches Mattie and says, \"I don't want you should trouble either\" . Ethan warns her not to let Zeena get to her today. When Jotham comes in he tells Ethan that Zeena asked him to drive Mattie away. Ethan says that he will be the one to drive Mattie. When Zeena comes in she tells Mattie she's arranged for her trunk to be transported. Mattie thanks her. Determined to give it another shot, Ethan decides to use Zeena's illness as an excuse to get Andrew Hale to loan him some money. Ethan walks back home.",
        "Directly following her outburst over the broken dish, Zeena retires upstairs to bed, and a shaken Mattie continues to clear up the kitchen. Ethan makes his usual rounds outside the house and returns to find the kitchen empty. His tobacco pouch and pipe have been laid out on the table next to a brief note in Mattie's handwriting telling him not to worry. Retreating into his makeshift study, Ethan contemplates the note over and over again, pondering a way out of his unbearable situation. Flinging aside in disgust a handmade cushion of Zeena's, Ethan mentally reviews the case of a local man who had deserted his wife in favor of the woman he loved. Encouraged by this precedent, Ethan resolves to run away with Mattie, and he prepares to write a letter of farewell to Zeena, leaving her the farm and the mill. But Ethan pauses at the prospect of starting over without any money, and he pictures the grim situation in which Zeena will be left. Ethan wakes up cold, stiff, and hungry, and rises in the knowledge that this will be Mattie's last day beneath his roof. As he stands alone in his study, he hears a step behind him and turns around to see Mattie, full of concern for his well-being after having listened all night for his return upstairs. Ethan, overwhelmed by her show of caring, lights the kitchen fire for her, and, as they sit down to a breakfast of leftovers, they decide not to worry about Zeena's threats. Ethan heads out to the cow barn, where he encounters Powell. When Powell presses to secure the details for the new hired girl's arrival and Mattie's departure, Ethan responds by saying that the matter of Mattie's dismissal is itself still unresolved. Back in the kitchen, the men enter to find Mattie and Zeena seated at a full breakfast table. Zeena eats heartily, feeds scraps to the cat, and discusses departure and arrival times with Powell. She then endeavors to settle a few final matters with Mattie, as Ethan looks on wordlessly. After finishing his morning tasks, Ethan tells Powell that he is heading into town and that they should not wait for him to have dinner. Frantically searching for a solution, Ethan decides again to ask Andrew Hale for the advance on the lumber, feeling that Hale would relent if he thought that the money would make a difference in Zeena's health. With the money, Ethan decides, he will be able to run away with Mattie and start a new life elsewhere. Aiming to intercept Hale before he departs for work, Ethan runs quickly down the hill, and spots the Hale wagon in the distance. She informs him that Hale is resting at home for the morning, and she speaks kindly to him about his fortitude in caring for Zeena before she goes on. Mrs. Hale's compassionate words encourage Ethan in his errand: if the Hales feel so sympathetic toward him, he thinks, surely they will advance him the cash. But after a few paces, Ethan's conscience catches up with his fantasies, and he realizes the extent of the deception in which he is prepared to engage. With his ethics now gaining dominance over his passions, Ethan slowly turns around and heads back to the farm.",
        "After Ethan's father died and Ethan returned to the farm from school, his mother gave him a room at the back of the house to serve as his \"study,\" a place for his desk and books. He has always taken refuge there; now that he has given Mattie the stove from the room, it is uninhabitable for most of the year. After everyone has gone to bed, Ethan goes to his study. Just before he himself goes to bed, he finds a note from Mattie on the kitchen table. It simply says, \"Don't trouble, Ethan;\" but it is the first time she has ever written anything to him. He rereads the note and thinks that such a cold, dead piece of paper represents his future with Mattie. He despises the thought of living out his years with Zeena. He goes to lie down on his couch, and throws away a cushion that Zeena made for him when they were engaged. Ethan remembers the story of a man, a young fellow his own age, who ran away from a life of misery by going west with another young woman. Ethan springs up and goes to his desk to start a letter to Zeena. Even if there were not, Zeena could never run the place. She would have to go back to her people, the same fate Zeena was forcing on Mattie. In addition, he would have trouble supporting Mattie. Ethan knows he does not have the money to pay for he and Mattie to go. Ethan returns to the sofa, and tears well up in him. He watches the moon dawn on the landscape and contemplates everything in life in terms of Mattie. Ethan wakes with the realization it will be Mattie's last day with him. Ethan stirs, and they go together to start the kitchen fire. As the sun comes up and Mattie goes about her work, Ethan feels better. He feels that with the return of daylight, Zeena, too, will see that it is insane to let Mattie go. Ethan and Mattie try to reassure each other, but they are not bolstered. Ethan goes out to the barn to clean stalls with Jotham. The hired hand says that he knows a fellow, Daniel Byrne, who can take Mattie's trunk over to the train station. Ethan is floored and wonders how Jotham knows about Mattie's leaving. Ethan says he is not sure Mattie is going. Zeena, alert and active, remarks that the geraniums have been neglected. She then turns to Jotham and asks when Mattie's trunk will be picked up. Jotham glances at Ethan and says \"about noon.\" Zeena says that she would like to go over the contents with Mattie before the trunk is picked up, implying that Mattie has stolen something. Ethan feels rebellious and walks into town for no purpose. Everything he sees reminds him of Mattie, and he decides he must do something to prevent her from leaving. She adds that she has heard of Zeena's recent trip to the new doctor and sympathizes with Ethan about all the trouble he has had in his life. Ethan walks back to his farm without seeing Hale.",
        "After Zeena retires upstairs, Mattie clears up the kitchen and Ethan makes his usual rounds outside. The kitchen is empty when he gets back, but Mattie has left a note for him, saying, \"Don't trouble, Ethan. \" Ethan feels he cannot give up the \"life\" and \"warmth\" that Mattie gives him. A storm of rebellion rises within him: why should he waste his life in service of the bitter, querulous Zeena, wose only pleasure is to inflict pain on him? He flings aside a cushion that Zeena had made and reflects on the case of a local man who had escaped from a similar life of misery by going West with the girl he loved. Encouraged by this example, Ethan decides to go West with Mattie, leaving a note for Zeena. Then Ethan begins to reflect. He was sure of finding work and could manage if he were alone, but with Mattie depending on him, the case was different. And the farm and mill were mortgaged to the hilt; Zeena would only clear a thousand dollars on the sale. She could return to her family, the fate she was forcing on Mattie. He is \"a prisoner for life,\" he decides, and will lose his \"one ray of light,\" Mattie. Then he notices that the moon is up, and remembers his promise to take Mattie sledding that evening. Ethan wakes cold, stiff and hungry, and recalls that it is Mattie's last day. Mattie comes in, aware that he has not been to bed, since she was listening all night for him to come upstairs. He comforts himself that Zeena may relent and allow Mattie to stay. When he goes out to the cow-barn he meets Jotham, who tells Ethan of the arrangements that Zeena has already made with him to take Mattie and her trunk to the station. Ethan replies that the question of Mattie's leaving is not settled. Zeena is unusually alert and is feeding the cat. She asks Jotham about the travel arrangements for Mattie. Then she says that there are some things she wants to clear up with Mattie before she leaves - namely, she believes that certain household items are missing. She and Mattie leave the room, and Jotham tells Ethan that he will go ahead with the travel arrangements. Ethan views these proceedings without a word. After Ethan finishes his morning tasks, he becomes fired with rebellion once more. He feels appalled that he has assisted \"as a helpless spectator at Mattie's banishment.\" Mattie's presence seems to infuse the entire scene. Mrs Hale tells him that she has heard about Zeena's going to see the new doctor. She expresses regret that Zeena is not feeling well and says that she does not know what she would have done if Ethan had not been around to take care of her. She commiserates with Ethan: \"You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome.\" Ethan is moved by Mrs Hale's kindness and at first is strengthened in his purpose, thinking that the Hales may look sympathetically on his request for payment. He cannot find the heart to leave Zeena alone and destitute, particularly if it means deceiving two kind people."

        "Jurgis, now awakened by Socialism, returns to Elzbieta's house where he attempts to convince her of the system's merits. She is skeptical, but decides that anything that keeps Jurgis away from drink and makes him industrious is worth it. Jurgis begins looking for a job and fortunately comes to find one in a hotel as a porter. When Ostrinski learns of Jurgis's job, he tells him that the hotel owner is one of the most passionate Socialist Party members in the city. Hinds tells Jurgis of his own life and struggles and anytime he is faced with adversity he mutters: \"'Capitalism, my boy, Capitalism. Jurgis begins to spend all his time and much of his money on spreading the Socialist cause, though he does occasionally fall into old habits of drink. Jurgis attempts to convert his neighbors to socialism, though he makes many enemies and almost gets into a few fights during the process. The people tell Jurgis that socialism is \"paternalism,\" but Jurgis argues that by letting the capitalists rule the country and build the libraries and social structures, they are not allowing the workers to build their own country. Jurgis meets and hears a number of famous socialist speakers and writers. Jurgis and the Socialist Party members distribute flyers and pamphlets telling the people of Packingtown what they can do to fight the Beef Trust when their strike fails. Jurgis stands up, however, and gives his own speech in the meeting, telling the crowd how he himself had been a part of the political machine that had bought votes and oppressed the voice of the people",
        "The next morning, Jurgis goes to find Teta Elzbieta. All she cares about is that Jurgis's new convictions mean that he plans to stay sober and look for a job. Once she figures that out, she encourages Jurgis's socialism as much as he wants. Jurgis starts looking for jobs at the various hotels in the neighborhood. A week later, Jurgis goes into the lobby of a hotel and approaches the owner. The owner asks Jurgis if he drinks. Jurgis says no, and the owner asks Jurgis if he is afraid of hard work. Jurgis says that's fine. Jurgis tells Ostrinski he's gotten a job at a nearby hotel. Ostrinski is thrilled to hear that Jurgis has been hired at Hind's Hotel. The next day, Jurgis informs his employer that he is also a socialist. Tommy Hinds calls Jurgis \"Comrade Jurgis,\" and Jurgis calls his boss \"Comrade Hinds.\" Ever since then, he has been getting himself invited to every business meeting and church service in Chicago so that he can preach the value of socialism far and wide. So he moved to Chicago and became a socialist. He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards. Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him to get personal - he just wants Jurgis to explain the bad business and hygiene practices at these meatpacking plants. Jurgis learns everything he needs to know about socialism working for Tommy Hinds. Because he has such faith in Tommy Hinds's views, Jurgis works harder and with more loyalty than he ever would have for the meatpackers. Jurgis does his best to convert his acquaintances to socialism. Jurgis feels that these people are forgetting that the people who really benefit from individualism and capitalism are the steel, oil, and meat magnates. Jurgis starts to read newspapers and to learn about America's history so that he can convince people to join the socialist cause. At socialist meetings, Jurgis meets a range of extraordinary organizers and great people who have sacrificed so much to join the cause of the working man. Jurgis becomes a regular reader of Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper with lots of tidbits about how the American working man suffers. Jurgis also hands out Appeal to Reason in the stockyards in an effort to undo the damage he did when he was part of Mike Scully's political machine.",
        "With his newfound faith and fire, Jurgis goes to see Elzbieta. Soon Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a hotel, a hotel that, coincidentally, is a political hotbed of socialism. The proprietor of the hotel, Tommy Hinds, and his staff educate Jurgis and others in the ways and means of socialism. Gradually, socialism becomes the root of Jurgis' existence.",

Ostrinski informs Jurgis that his new boss, Tommy Hinds, is actually a state organizer for the socialist party and a well-known socialist speaker. Hinds is overjoyed to find that Jurgis is a comrade. Hinds often urges Jurgis to detail the horrendous filth of the meat-packing plants along with the real recipes for tinned meats and sausages. Jurgis takes up the socialist cause with a passion."

He realizes that Chad and Madame have left Paris so they can find a nice quiet inn outside the city and, ahem, engage in a sexual relationship. Once Chad and Madame get to shore, all of them are like, \"Wow, what a coincidence! This is followed by a super awkward dinner, where Chad and Madame can only think about how ol' third-wheel Strether is blowing their chance at sex. While Strether is thinking that his whole life has been a lie since getting to Paris. Instead, he's the one gullible loser in Paris who was too naive to see what was happening right in front of his eyes. When Strether leaves them and goes home, he realizes that all along, he's been allowing himself to enjoy Paris because he has enjoyed being among young women and men while still thinking to himself that he wasn't doing anything morally wrong. But now his image of a perfect Chad and perfect Madame de Vionnet has been shattered, and he doesn't know what to believe anymore. Worse yet, Chad and Madame's sexual relationship means that on some level, Sarah Pocock was right all along.",
        "Strether is going to find a way to get in touch with Chad. So this time when he visits Chad's apartment, Chad's actually there. Strether looks up and sees him smoking a cigarette and leaning over the balcony railing, just like the artist Bilham did when Strether first came to Paris. The memory makes Strether nostalgic about the days before he knew about Chad and Madame de Vionnet. Finally, Strether pipes up and tells Chad that he'll be a monster if he ever leaves Madame de Vionnet. Chad says that he would probably never do this, but probably ain't good enough for Strether. Strether says that he wants this to be the last thing he says to Chad during their time in Paris. Chad asks what all of this \"last thing I say\" stuff is all about, and Strether tells him that he's leaving Paris. Chad tells Strether that he's been away in England all week because sometimes a guy just feels like he needs to get away. Chad tells Strether that everything will be fine between him and Madame. He wants Chad to swear on his life that he won't go back to Woollett and give his family the satisfaction of thinking they've won.

They have dinner together and return to Paris on the same train. The couple's discomfiture forces Strether to the truth that Madame de Vionnet is Chad's mistress: \"Her shawl and Chad's overcoat and her other garments, and his, those they had each worn the day before, were at the place, best known to themselves -- a quiet retreat enough, no doubt -- at which they had been spending the twenty-four hours.\" Strether is disillusioned as much with Chad as he is to learn of the affair; Chad, he acknowledges, \"habitually left things to others, as Strether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration of his famous knowing how to live.\" Thinking how he would respond to Maria's inevitable question , Strether \"recognized at last that he had really been trying all along to suppose nothing.\"",
        "Concerned by Chad's unlikely disappearance, Strether goes to the young man's apartment to see if he has returned. Chad is there, having in fact just returned from a trip to London, and he greets Strether warmly. As they talk, it occurs to Strether that he could stay in Paris with Chad indefinitely. This raises a moment of regret in Strether's mind, but he finally tells Chad he has come to bid him goodbye. Chad protests the idea and says he doesn't know what should make Strether feel he is tired of Madame de Vionnet. He reminds Chad of all Madame de Vionnet has done for him and says, \"I remember you, you know, as you were.\" As he walks Strether back to his hotel, Chad suddenly announces a revived interest in the art of advertising, and Strether wonders if he will give up Madame de Vionnet after all.

Yet he consoles himself with the thought that he and Ellen are different from the rest of New York society and that their unique situation puts them above the judgment of their clan. That evening, he waits in front of Beaufort's house for Ellen, who we learn has come to console Regina Beaufort in the midst of her troubles.

Ellen explains that she has decided to stay near her grandmother because she feels she will be safe there from the temptation of Archer. Archer agrees, and they plan to meet two days later.

At dinner, the topic of discussion is again the Beauforts' financial failure. The van der Luydens are dismayed to learn that Ellen had been to see Mrs. Beaufort, an action they conceive of as imprudent, considering the Beauforts' fall from good society. At the opera, Archer feels guilty about his intended tryst with Ellen. At his side, May is wearing her wedding dress, as is the custom for young married women. Archer suddenly feels the urge to confess to her, and he persuades May to leave the opera early.

        "The setting is the garden in the Manor House--Jack's country estate. Miss Prism is sitting at the table while Cecily is in the back, watering the flowers. Miss Prism calls to Cecily to stop doing such a mundane task as watering the flowers because she needs to do her German grammar lesson. Cecily argues that she doesn't want to because she knows she looks plain after her German lesson. Miss Prism retorts that Uncle Jack is only looking out for Cecily's education. Cecily complains that Uncle Jack is so serious. This piques Cecily's interest and she wishes aloud that Uncle Jack would bring Ernest by sometime so that Miss Prism could reform him. Miss Prism tells Cecily to work on her lesson. They're so obviously crushing on each other that Cecily finds it easy to persuade them to take a walk together. While they're out, Merriman the butler tells Cecily that a Mr. Ernest Worthing has just arrived. Cecily is overjoyed to finally be able to meet the infamous Ernest, but she's scared at the same time. Algernon enters, disguised as Ernest. They talk about how \"wicked\" he is, with Cecily making comments about how he should reform himself. Charmingly, Algernon/Ernest asks Cecily to try to reform him that very afternoon. As they're flirting and Ernest is finding every way possible to compliment Cecily, like asking for a pink rose for his button-hole \"because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily\" . Algernon learns that Jack plans to send Ernest to Australia. They're so wrapped up in each other that they don't realize that Cecily is not where they left her. Before they can send out a search party, Jack arrives home, dressed in a black suit of mourning. When they ask him about it, Jack announces that he's returned early because his brother Ernest is dead. When Dr. Chasuble offers to perform a funeral ceremony for Ernest, Jack suddenly remembers something.

Jack tells Merriman that unfortunately Ernest's dog-cart has arrived to take him away; he's been called back to town. While Jack rants at Algernon, Algernon talks about how pretty Cecily is. Jack declares the dog-cart is here and leaves, just in time to miss Algy's comment that he has fallen in love with Cecily. Cecily appears with a watering can in her hand. She and Ernest/Algernon exchange glances. She pleads with Merriman to let Ernest stay for another five minutes. Algernon informs her that Jack is sending him away and compliments her beauty. Flattered, Cecily begins copying his words down in her diary, but refuses to let him look at it. When the dog-cart comes again, Ernest tells it to come again next week. Without ceremony, he asks Cecily to marry him. Apparently, Ernest proposed on Valentine's day but they'd broken it off a month later. Ernest kisses her for being so forgiving. Then she confides that it's always been a \"girlish dream of mine to love someone whose name was Ernest\" . Distraught, he asks her if she could love him under any other name... say... Algernon, for instance. Cecily finds it a rather aristocratic name, but no, she wouldn't be able to love him then. At that declaration, Ernest/Algernon promptly begins asking her about the rector and whether or not he performs christenings. Algernon leaves to find Dr. Chasuble about a very important matter. As he leaves, Cecily comments that she likes his hair so much. Soon, Merriman enters to tell Cecily that a Miss Fairfax has arrived to see Mr. Worthing. Cecily invites Miss Fairfax to sit with her until Uncle Jack comes out. They talk for a little while before Gwendolen works up the balls to ask Cecily if she can inspect her. Gwendolen, peering through her glasses, finds Cecily rather too attractive and loudly wishes that she were a bit older and more decidedly more dowdy. She asks about Cici's relations and finds out that Mr. Worthing is Cecily's guardian. Now that's problematic, Gwendolen says, since Ernest never mentioned it to her. When Cecily hears the name Ernest, she quickly explains the situation. It's not Ernest Worthing who is my guardian, she says sweetly, but his older brother, Jack. That's a relief to Gwendolen, who suddenly becomes polite again. Cecily proudly declares that she's going to be Ernest Worthing's wife. Gwendolen rises to her feet. Ernest proposed to me yesterday. Cecily retorts that he must've changed his mind because he just proposed to her ten minutes ago. The two women eye each other coldly before Gwendolen announces--alluding to Cecily's rude manners--that they obviously move in different social circles. Right before they can start clawing at each other, Merriman comes by to arrange their tea things. As Merriman serves them, they glare at each other but chitchat in cordial tones. When Cecily serves Gwendolen tea, she serves it in the opposite manner that Gwendolen requests--giving her lots of sugar in her tea and cake instead of bread and butter. Thank goodness, Jack arrives just in time to break up their fight. When Gwendolen jumps on him and asks if he's to be married to Cecily, Jack laughs it off and kisses Gwendolen. Cecily replies that he's not Ernest Worthing; that's Uncle Jack. At the unglamorous name, Gwendolen recoils in disgust. Right on cue, Algernon enters and Cecily goes through the same routine with him. When he confirms he's not to be married to Gwendolen, she allows him to kiss her. This time it's Gwendolen's turn to clear up the confusion. She reveals that he's not Ernest Worthing; it's Algernon Moncrieff, her cousin. Cecily backs away when she hears \"Algernon.\" They finally ask Jack who Ernest is and he is forced to admit that Ernest doesn't exist. When both girls realize with horror that neither of them are engaged to Ernest, they agree to go into the house where the men won't dare to follow them. They argue for a while and Algernon sits down agitatedly and begins to eat the muffins left by the ladies. Jack comments that it's heartless for him to eat so calmly when they're in such a state and begins fighting with him over the muffins. In the midst of their squabbling, each discovers that the other has a christening to attend that evening to be named Ernest."

        "Act II begins the following morning, as Christy, alone, counts the pub's crockery and glassware. They have heard about Christy, and want to see him for themselves. They flirt with him a bit, and then Widow Quin enters, announcing that she has registered Christy for the sports competition happening down on the beach. As the girls and the widow prepare breakfast for him, Christy fleshes out the story of the murder. His father had ordered Christy to marry a fat, ugly widow-woman twice his age. When Christy refused, his father threatened him with a scythe, and Christy in turn threatened his father with a spade. When his father struck at him, Christy feinted and then delivered the fatal blow to the older man's skull. Susan teases that the Lord God has sent Christy to their village to wed the Widow Quin. The widow and Christy link arms, and drink a toast \"to the wonders of the western world\" . Pegeen enters to see the toast, and kicks the women out. She then accuses Christy of flirting, which he denies. The description completely unnerves Christy, who prepares to flee. However, Pegeen calms him down, insisting she was only mocking him, and that she has found no mention of his crime in the paper. Pegeen and Christy then exchange kind, tender fantasies about the future they might share together. Shawn warns Pegeen that her family's sheep are eating cabbage in a neighbor's field, and hence might burst their stomachs. Pegeen runs out to collect her sheep, at which point Shawn offers Christy a one-way ticket to the \"Western States\" , his new hat, his excellent breeches, his new coat, and his blessing if Christy will agree to leave the village. Christy rejects this offer. However, the widow exhorts him to try on the new clothes so he will have something nice to wear for the competition, and Christy accepts. While Christy is gone, Shawn promises Widow Quin a ewe if she can interrupt the burgeoning relationship between Pegeen and the stranger. The widow asks what Shawn would pay if she could get Christy to marry her, and Shawn names just about everything he owns. Christy parades back in, now wearing Shawn's clothes. Christy continues to prance about, imagining a future of fine clothes and gifts celebrating his triumphant deed. Christy hides just as Old Mahon enters. Old Mahon immediately inquires whether the widow has seen a young fellow, whom he has been tracking for ten days. He further describes the son - Christy, of course - as too weak to drink or smoke a pipe, and as absurdly fearful of women. In fact, Christy is the butt of his own townswomen's jokes. Mahon exits abruptly to chase after this lead. His father gone, Christy wonders why the man pretended to be dead, and wishes a violent death for him now. Christy then grows suddenly tearful as he imagines losing the new life with Pegeen that he was on the verge of beginning. The widow softly suggests that she and Christy are alike in character, each with a melancholy side that accompanies having killed a close relation. She begins to paint a picture of a tender future they might share together, but Christy hardly hears her, as the sound of the approaching girls interrupts them. Christy begs the widow to help him win Pegeen. Just like that, Widow Quin relinquishes her own design on Christy, and agrees to keep his secret. If Old Mahon should return, she will swear he is a lunatic. Sarah, Honor and Susan enter to lead Christy down to the beach so he can compete in the sports. Once they leave, Widow Quin reflects that even if his secret is revealed, she will end up with him as husband as consolation, since he will have nobody else to turn to."

Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out",
        "Antonio, the Duchess, and their children arrive, and are banished from Ancona.",
        "Scene Four returns to the residence of the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. The Cardinal tells them not to stay with Ferdinand tonight because having people around makes him worse, although in reality he simply wants to ensure that no one is around when he gets rid of Julia's body. He further tells them of a plan to imitate Ferdinand's insanity in an attempt to get his confidence, and so they should ignore any extreme sounds or cries they might hear. They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally. Before he dies, Bosola tells Antonio what happened to his family. Bosola is devastated by his mistake, and tells the servant to take Antonio's body to Julia's room",
        "The Cardinal is talking to Castruchio's wife Julia, saying something along the lines of, \"so, what did you tell your husband this time to get yourself out here?\" Julia and the Cardinal. Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. A servant comes to tell Julia that Delio and Castruchio have both come to Rome, and that Delio's waiting outside to see her. The Cardinal leaves, and Delio comes in. Turns out Delio used to have a thing for Julia, and the first thing he does is offer Julia money. Julia doesn't know what's up, until Delio tells her he'd really appreciate it if she'd become his mistress. Julia's either got Victoria's Secret levels of hotness or she's just exceedingly politically convenient. It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess. Julia's admirably quick on the draw: \"Sure, you know what, Delio, I'll get right back to you; lemme go ask my husband what he thinks.\" She leaves Delio alone, who's getting really worried. He hears that the Cardinal is enraged about some letter he's received from Malfi, and fears that somehow Antonio's marriage to the Duchess has been revealed.",

He says he wants them to stay put because he doesn't want Ferdinand to be bothered at all, but really he just wants to be sure that he can dispose of Julia's body in peace. Plans to murder your minions are best kept in your head: Bosola hears him, and knows what's up. Ferdinand the Crazy wanders in and then out, talking to himself. Antonio comes in, saying to himself that he hopes he catches the Cardinal while he's praying, so that maybe he'll be in the mood to forgive him. Bosola, not being able to see that it's Antonio, and, thinking he's some random murder, interprets his words as \"I hope I'll kill that Bosola while he's praying, maybe the Cardinal will pardon me then.\" Quickly, Bosola comes forward and wounds Antonio, only to immediately thereafter discover that it's Antonio, the very guy he was hoping to save. Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered. Why on earth he should tell the dying Antonio that his family is dead when he'd previously lied to the Duchess about the same thing is kind of confusing. Antonio, finally knowing the truth, tells Bosola he just wants to die. He dies, after he voices his final wish that his remaining son be raised away from the courts, and that his body be given to Delio. Bosola takes his body to where he was supposed to put Julia's body. Quick thing to note: this is the third time the audience has watched Bosola drag a dead body offstage."
