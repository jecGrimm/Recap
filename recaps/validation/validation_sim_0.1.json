When he wakes up, he runs into Uncle Silas, and the two of them go back to the Phelps farm, which is full of local men discussing the strange cabin and its contents. The farmers decide that Jim must have been helped by several slaves and the writing is some sort of \"secret African\" language. The next day, Tom and Jim arrive at the Phelps' with the doctor and several of the farmers. Tom is on a mattress and Jim has his hands tied. The men argue whether or not to hang Jim, and the doctor explains how Jim helped with Tom instead of running away. The next morning Tom wakes up and begins to tell Aunt Sally how he and \"Tom\" orchestrated the entire escape. Tom relishes the retelling until he hears that Jim is still in captivity. Tom rises up in bed and demands that they free Jim because he has known all along that Miss Watson had died and set Jim free in her will.

        "I will\" and a naming of things which belong to him, such as his hands and his spirit, Equality 7-2521 explains that he has found his answer. He needs no reason to exist because he is his own reason. He names his eyes and ears as the organs which give significance and beauty to the world. Some words are wise and others are false, but only the words \"I will it\" are holy. He knows now that he is the end of his journey, and he does not care of the overall significance of the earth because he knows about happiness. The fulfillment of happiness, in his view, is its own purpose. Furthermore, he refuses to be a tool for anyone else's accomplishments or happiness. Declaring himself to be a man and his own miracle, he decides that he cannot share or give away his treasures of thought, will, and especially freedom. He cannot help \"the poor of spirit\" by giving up his own spirit. In particular, he states that he is not by default a friend or an enemy to other men because love and honor must be earned. However, he will seek friends that he respects rather than slaves or master in an unequal power relationship. Continuing to speak in the first person singular, Equality 7-2521 rejects the use of the word \"We\" as the default word. The collectivism implicit in the word \"We\" does nothing but cause stagnation and the sapping away of the strength of the good, the wise, and the strong. Life is nothing if every man is subject to all others. He declares himself as \"done with this creed of corruption.\" In its place, he substitutes the word \"I,\" which is the god that will give men control over the earth and over their own lives.",
        "Equality 7-2521 has finally discovered the first-person singular. He, himself, is the meaning of things. Equality 7-2521 needs no reason or \"warrant\" to be. He is his own reason for being. His own will is the only thing he needs to obey. Equality 7-2521 has realized his own happiness is his highest end. In fact, Equality 7-2521 doesn't owe anything to anyone. The word, \"we,\" is a dangerous word, Equality 7-2521 says. Actually, it's the root of all evil. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is done with \"we.\" It is a monster. Now, instead, he sees the face of god. God is \"I.\"",
        "So opens the chapter in which Equality 7-2521 re-discovers the lost and holy word, the forbidden idea for which the Saint of the Pyre was burned at the stake. The acquisition of this knowledge fulfills the intellectual quest on which Equality 7-2521 had embarked as a 10-year-old -- the attempt to discover and understand the Unspeakable Word. He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He is the warrant and sanction of his existence. He is overcome with the emotional experience of his intellectual realization: he has a right to his own life. He is not a mere appendage of a group. He can choose his own path in life -- his own interests, his own profession, his own wife, his own home. He is a free man, able to choose his goals, and then work strenuously to achieve them. Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service. Equality 7-2521 realizes, after studying the books of the Unmentionable Times, what the proper relation is between individuals. He states that he is neither a friend nor a foe to others, \"but such as each of them shall deserve.\" Love, he claims, must be earned -- and that requires more than the sheer fact of being born; it requires the attainment of virtue. Equality 7-2521 will choose friends from among his fellow humans, but neither masters nor servants. He says that he will love and respect his friends, but neither command nor obey them. And when humans come together in friendship and in love, they will join hands only beyond each one's \"holy threshold,\" and each will respect the personal boundaries of the other. Looking back on his past life in the city -- and thinking sorrowfully of those innocent people still trapped there -- he realizes that the horrors of his former society are the result of destroying the personal boundaries that each individual properly claims as their own. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is forever done with the code of \"we,\" with this creed of evil and destruction. He sees clearly the beneficent consequences that can result -- as they did in the past -- when society recognizes the sacred rights of individuals to mind, soul, values, and life. He observes the face of a god, the god sought by humans since the inception of the world, the god who will grant joy and peace and pride. \"This god, this one word: I.\"",
        "Equality 7-2521 realizes the meaning of the word \"I\" and realizes what has been missing from his world. His eyes' seeing makes the earth beautiful, and his ears' hearing makes the earth sing. His mind's searching gives the earth truth. In his new view, the only three holy words are \"I will it. Equality 7-2521 realizes that the goal of his existence, no matter what may come of the earth, is his personal happiness. He is not a means to an end, and he is not a servant of his brothers. His miracles are his and his alone, and he will protect them from others at all costs. He says that his treasures are his thoughts, his will, and his freedom, and the greatest of these is freedom. Those of his brothers who earn his honor will have it, but they will not have it just by virtue of being fellow men. In Equality 7-2521's newfound view, the word \"we\" must always be a second thought to men, after the word \"I. When it is allowed to become a primary thought, it is the root of all evil and becomes a great lie. The word \"we\" enables the weak to steal from the strong and becomes a stone that crushes all those beneath it. Equality 7-2521 vows that he is finished with the old society and collectivism. He has seen the face of god, and he will raise it above the earth so that everyone may worship at its altar. His new god is \"I",
        "Finally Equality 7-2521 discovers the word \"I\" through his reading of the old scripts. \"My happiness is not the means to any end. \"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others."

        "Ethan has a tiny study on the first floor, done up in humble imitation of the study of a minister who was kind to him in Worcester. Since Mattie came and he moved the stove up to her room, it has been uninhabitable during the winter. He carries with him a tiny note written by Mattie and left for him on the kitchen table: \"Don't trouble, Ethan\". He begins a farewell letter to Zeena. But as he tries to plan a course of action for himself, he realizes that escape is impossible. Zeena will not be able to sell the farm for any considerable sum, and she has no means to survive in the mean time. And as for him and Mattie, they don't even have enough money to get out West. Ethan falls asleep in the study despite the cold. A coach is going to come later in the day to pick up Mattie's heavy trunk, and Jotham is going to take Mattie to the station when he goes to pick up the new hired girl. Ethan heads toward town, humiliated by his own powerlessness. He suddenly considers a new plan: if he tells Andrew Hale that he needs money to hire a girl to help Zeena, he could use the cash advance to flee west with Mattie. He goes to the Hale mill, running into their sleigh on the weigh. Mrs. Hale is the rider, and she talks to Ethan sympathetically about Zeena's latest health problems. She admires Ethan for taking care of Zeena and before her, his mother. The sleigh takes off, and Ethan keeps on toward the Hales': if they feel sorry for him, they're sure to loan him the money. But then Ethan realizes that he is planning to use the compassion of the Hales' to get money dishonestly. He realizes the truth of his situation: Zeena cannot fend for herself, and Ethan's flight with Mattie would depend on deceiving the Hales. He turns and goes back to his own farm.",
        "Ethan has a little make-shift study that he hadn't used in a while be because the heater that previously heated it was given to Mattie for her room. When Zeena was safely sleeping, Ethan headed to that room. He and Mattie hadn't talked after the scene, but when he'd come in from doing his final chores he found a note left by Mattie before she went to bed. It said, \"Don't trouble, Ethan.\" This was his first note ever from Mattie. The note makes him feel closer to her. Wrestling with his mind, Ethan decides he can have happiness. Ethan had met the couple and seen their cute little baby. He decides to write Zeena a letter and then leave with Mattie the next day. Crushed, Ethan learns that he can't even afford the cheapest ticket, and nobody would loan him any money. He cries and falls asleep thinking of how he and Mattie were supposed to sled tonight. When he wakes up, he realizes it's Mattie's final day on the farm. Mattie is waiting for him. She'd heard him leave the house last night and had not heard him return. Ethan touches Mattie and says, \"I don't want you should trouble either\" . Ethan warns her not to let Zeena get to her today. When Jotham comes in he tells Ethan that Zeena asked him to drive Mattie away. Ethan says that he will be the one to drive Mattie. When Zeena comes in she tells Mattie she's arranged for her trunk to be transported. Mattie thanks her. Determined to give it another shot, Ethan decides to use Zeena's illness as an excuse to get Andrew Hale to loan him some money. Mrs. Hale is very sweet to him, and tells him she feels bad that he's had such a hard life. Ethan walks back home.",
        "Directly following her outburst over the broken dish, Zeena retires upstairs to bed, and a shaken Mattie continues to clear up the kitchen. Ethan makes his usual rounds outside the house and returns to find the kitchen empty. His tobacco pouch and pipe have been laid out on the table next to a brief note in Mattie's handwriting telling him not to worry. Retreating into his makeshift study, Ethan contemplates the note over and over again, pondering a way out of his unbearable situation. Flinging aside in disgust a handmade cushion of Zeena's, Ethan mentally reviews the case of a local man who had deserted his wife in favor of the woman he loved. Encouraged by this precedent, Ethan resolves to run away with Mattie, and he prepares to write a letter of farewell to Zeena, leaving her the farm and the mill. But Ethan pauses at the prospect of starting over without any money, and he pictures the grim situation in which Zeena will be left. Slowly, he comes to the bitter recognition of his plan's impracticality, and he crumples back to the sofa in tears, falling asleep beneath the light of a large moon in the beautiful winter night sky. Ethan wakes up cold, stiff, and hungry, and rises in the knowledge that this will be Mattie's last day beneath his roof. As he stands alone in his study, he hears a step behind him and turns around to see Mattie, full of concern for his well-being after having listened all night for his return upstairs. Ethan, overwhelmed by her show of caring, lights the kitchen fire for her, and, as they sit down to a breakfast of leftovers, they decide not to worry about Zeena's threats. Ethan heads out to the cow barn, where he encounters Powell. When Powell presses to secure the details for the new hired girl's arrival and Mattie's departure, Ethan responds by saying that the matter of Mattie's dismissal is itself still unresolved. Back in the kitchen, the men enter to find Mattie and Zeena seated at a full breakfast table. Zeena eats heartily, feeds scraps to the cat, and discusses departure and arrival times with Powell. She then endeavors to settle a few final matters with Mattie, as Ethan looks on wordlessly. After finishing his morning tasks, Ethan tells Powell that he is heading into town and that they should not wait for him to have dinner. Frantically searching for a solution, Ethan decides again to ask Andrew Hale for the advance on the lumber, feeling that Hale would relent if he thought that the money would make a difference in Zeena's health. With the money, Ethan decides, he will be able to run away with Mattie and start a new life elsewhere. Aiming to intercept Hale before he departs for work, Ethan runs quickly down the hill, and spots the Hale wagon in the distance. Arriving at its side, he finds not Hale but Hale's wife in the sleigh. She informs him that Hale is resting at home for the morning, and she speaks kindly to him about his fortitude in caring for Zeena before she goes on. Mrs. Hale's compassionate words encourage Ethan in his errand: if the Hales feel so sympathetic toward him, he thinks, surely they will advance him the cash. But after a few paces, Ethan's conscience catches up with his fantasies, and he realizes the extent of the deception in which he is prepared to engage. With his ethics now gaining dominance over his passions, Ethan slowly turns around and heads back to the farm.",
        "After Ethan's father died and Ethan returned to the farm from school, his mother gave him a room at the back of the house to serve as his \"study,\" a place for his desk and books. He has always taken refuge there; now that he has given Mattie the stove from the room, it is uninhabitable for most of the year. After everyone has gone to bed, Ethan goes to his study. Just before he himself goes to bed, he finds a note from Mattie on the kitchen table. It simply says, \"Don't trouble, Ethan;\" but it is the first time she has ever written anything to him. He rereads the note and thinks that such a cold, dead piece of paper represents his future with Mattie. He despises the thought of living out his years with Zeena. He goes to lie down on his couch, and throws away a cushion that Zeena made for him when they were engaged. Ethan remembers the story of a man, a young fellow his own age, who ran away from a life of misery by going west with another young woman. Ethan springs up and goes to his desk to start a letter to Zeena. She would have to go back to her people, the same fate Zeena was forcing on Mattie. In addition, he would have trouble supporting Mattie. Ethan knows he does not have the money to pay for he and Mattie to go. Ethan returns to the sofa, and tears well up in him. He watches the moon dawn on the landscape and contemplates everything in life in terms of Mattie. He remembers that they were supposed to go coasting tonight; now they will probably never be able to go. As he nurses his misery, the beauty of the landscape mocks him until he falls asleep. Ethan wakes with the realization it will be Mattie's last day with him. Ethan stirs, and they go together to start the kitchen fire. As the sun comes up and Mattie goes about her work, Ethan feels better. He feels that with the return of daylight, Zeena, too, will see that it is insane to let Mattie go. Ethan and Mattie try to reassure each other, but they are not bolstered. Ethan goes out to the barn to clean stalls with Jotham. Ethan is floored and wonders how Jotham knows about Mattie's leaving. Ethan says he is not sure Mattie is going. She then turns to Jotham and asks when Mattie's trunk will be picked up. Jotham glances at Ethan and says \"about noon.\" Zeena says that she would like to go over the contents with Mattie before the trunk is picked up, implying that Mattie has stolen something. The two women leave the kitchen, and Jotham remarks that he guesses he better tell Daniel to come around after all. Ethan feels rebellious and walks into town for no purpose. Everything he sees reminds him of Mattie, and he decides he must do something to prevent her from leaving. He decides to again ask Hale for some cash and proceeds towards his house. He meets Mrs. Hale on the road, and she says that Mr. Hale is home sick. She adds that she has heard of Zeena's recent trip to the new doctor and sympathizes with Ethan about all the trouble he has had in his life. Ethan walks back to his farm without seeing Hale.",
        "After Zeena retires upstairs, Mattie clears up the kitchen and Ethan makes his usual rounds outside. The kitchen is empty when he gets back, but Mattie has left a note for him, saying, \"Don't trouble, Ethan. \" Ethan feels he cannot give up the \"life\" and \"warmth\" that Mattie gives him. He flings aside a cushion that Zeena had made and reflects on the case of a local man who had escaped from a similar life of misery by going West with the girl he loved. Encouraged by this example, Ethan decides to go West with Mattie, leaving a note for Zeena. Then Ethan begins to reflect. He was sure of finding work and could manage if he were alone, but with Mattie depending on him, the case was different. She could return to her family, the fate she was forcing on Mattie. But then he notices an advertisement in the paper offering trips West, and realizes he cannot even afford the reduced rate. He is \"a prisoner for life,\" he decides, and will lose his \"one ray of light,\" Mattie. Then he notices that the moon is up, and remembers his promise to take Mattie sledding that evening. Ethan wakes cold, stiff and hungry, and recalls that it is Mattie's last day. Mattie comes in, aware that he has not been to bed, since she was listening all night for him to come upstairs. He comforts himself that Zeena may relent and allow Mattie to stay. When he goes out to the cow-barn he meets Jotham, who tells Ethan of the arrangements that Zeena has already made with him to take Mattie and her trunk to the station. Ethan replies that the question of Mattie's leaving is not settled. She asks Jotham about the travel arrangements for Mattie. Then she says that there are some things she wants to clear up with Mattie before she leaves - namely, she believes that certain household items are missing. She and Mattie leave the room, and Jotham tells Ethan that he will go ahead with the travel arrangements. Ethan views these proceedings without a word. After Ethan finishes his morning tasks, he becomes fired with rebellion once more. Mattie's presence seems to infuse the entire scene. He will ask Andrew Hale once more to advance him a payment on the wood, using the excuse that Zeena's ill health makes it necessary to hire a servant. Catching sight of Hale's sleigh, he hurries to meet it, but sees it is Mrs Hale in the sleigh. She expresses regret that Zeena is not feeling well and says that she does not know what she would have done if Ethan had not been around to take care of her. She commiserates with Ethan: \"You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome.\" Ethan is moved by Mrs Hale's kindness and at first is strengthened in his purpose, thinking that the Hales may look sympathetically on his request for payment. He begins to walk to their house to see Mr Hale, but draws up short at the realization that he is about to take advantage of their sympathy to obtain money on false pretences. He cannot find the heart to leave Zeena alone and destitute, particularly if it means deceiving two kind people."

        "Jurgis, now awakened by Socialism, returns to Elzbieta's house where he attempts to convince her of the system's merits. She is skeptical, but decides that anything that keeps Jurgis away from drink and makes him industrious is worth it. Jurgis begins looking for a job and fortunately comes to find one in a hotel as a porter. When Ostrinski learns of Jurgis's job, he tells him that the hotel owner is one of the most passionate Socialist Party members in the city. The hotel, owned by a man name Hinds, is a hotbed of Socialist activity. Hinds tells Jurgis of his own life and struggles and anytime he is faced with adversity he mutters: \"'Capitalism, my boy, Capitalism. The hotel employs a number of Socialist Party members and every night the employees get into intense arguments and debates with guests who defend systems of capitalism and individualism. Some guests change their minds and attitudes towards socialism, and some do not. Jurgis begins to spend all his time and much of his money on spreading the Socialist cause, though he does occasionally fall into old habits of drink. At those times, he remembers, however, that it is a \"wicked thing to spend one's pennies for a drink, when the working-class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered. Jurgis attempts to convert his neighbors to socialism, though he makes many enemies and almost gets into a few fights during the process. The people tell Jurgis that socialism is \"paternalism,\" but Jurgis argues that by letting the capitalists rule the country and build the libraries and social structures, they are not allowing the workers to build their own country. Jurgis meets and hears a number of famous socialist speakers and writers. He meets the \"Little Giant,\" a little person who \"had written a veritable encyclopedia\" of Socialism. He hears a young author from California that had made a fortune selling books but that had never ceased to fight for the poor. He begins to read the \"Appeal to Reason,\" a tabloid newspaper that spreads the word of socialism through fantastical stories. Jurgis and the Socialist Party members distribute flyers and pamphlets telling the people of Packingtown what they can do to fight the Beef Trust when their strike fails. Feeling pressure, Mike Scully brings in the South Carolina \"pitchfork Senator\" to speak to the workers and to fight for the Republican Party. Jurgis stands up, however, and gives his own speech in the meeting, telling the crowd how he himself had been a part of the political machine that had bought votes and oppressed the voice of the people",
        "He starts talking to her about socialism. Teta Elzbieta couldn't care less about whether or not socialism is right for the world. All she cares about is that Jurgis's new convictions mean that he plans to stay sober and look for a job. Once she figures that out, she encourages Jurgis's socialism as much as he wants. Jurgis starts looking for jobs at the various hotels in the neighborhood. A week later, Jurgis goes into the lobby of a hotel and approaches the owner. The owner asks Jurgis if he drinks. Jurgis says no, and the owner asks Jurgis if he is afraid of hard work. There's a job available for a night porter, but he'll have to do a lot of cleaning and hauling. Jurgis says that's fine. Ostrinski is thrilled to hear that Jurgis has been hired at Hind's Hotel. Apparently, Tommy Hinds, the owner of this place, is a state organizer of the Socialist Party in Illinois. The next day, Jurgis informs his employer that he is also a socialist. Tommy Hinds calls Jurgis \"Comrade Jurgis,\" and Jurgis calls his boss \"Comrade Hinds.\" Tommy Hinds frequently goes out to convince people to vote the socialist ticket to solve their troubles. He has a history as a union organizer and populist. Ever since then, he has been getting himself invited to every business meeting and church service in Chicago so that he can preach the value of socialism far and wide. Tommy Hinds's hotel is also a big source of pro-socialist political activity. His staff members are all socialists, and his chief clerk has been fighting the big railroad companies his whole life. His assistant clerk is Harry Adams, a smart guy from Massachusetts who moved down south to South Carolina and was horrified by the widespread illiteracy and poverty he found there. So he moved to Chicago and became a socialist. Oddly, the fact that this hotel is a socialist business doesn't mean it's not profitable. He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards. Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him to get personal - he just wants Jurgis to explain the bad business and hygiene practices at these meatpacking plants. Jurgis learns everything he needs to know about socialism working for Tommy Hinds. Because he has such faith in Tommy Hinds's views, Jurgis works harder and with more loyalty than he ever would have for the meatpackers. Jurgis does his best to convert his acquaintances to socialism. Even though the benefits of socialism seem obvious to Jurgis, a lot of working people resist. They claim to prefer individualism, and resist the kind of control on their money that socialism would mean. Jurgis feels that these people are forgetting that the people who really benefit from individualism and capitalism are the steel, oil, and meat magnates. Jurgis starts to read newspapers and to learn about America's history so that he can convince people to join the socialist cause. At socialist meetings, Jurgis meets a range of extraordinary organizers and great people who have sacrificed so much to join the cause of the working man. Jurgis becomes a regular reader of Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper with lots of tidbits about how the American working man suffers. They begin to distribute this newspaper in Packingtown after the union lost the strike there, so that workers can take hope. Jurgis also hands out Appeal to Reason in the stockyards in an effort to undo the damage he did when he was part of Mike Scully's political machine. The socialists are gaining a real political foothold in Packingtown, and Mike Scully and his political machine are on the run.",
        "With his newfound faith and fire, Jurgis goes to see Elzbieta. She is not interested in his politics but notices the spark of industry in his eyes and tolerates his rhetoric. Soon Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a hotel, a hotel that, coincidentally, is a political hotbed of socialism. The proprietor of the hotel, Tommy Hinds, and his staff educate Jurgis and others in the ways and means of socialism. Gradually, socialism becomes the root of Jurgis' existence.",
        "Jurgis visits Teta Elzbieta to tell her about socialism. She is happy to hear that he wishes to work and help support the family. She even agrees to attend socialist political meetings with him from time to time. Jurgis finds a job as a porter in a small hotel that pays thirty dollars a month plus board. Ostrinski informs Jurgis that his new boss, Tommy Hinds, is actually a state organizer for the socialist party and a well-known socialist speaker. Hinds is overjoyed to find that Jurgis is a comrade. Hinds never tires of preaching socialism in his hotel and elsewhere. Socialists flock to the hotel, so the radical philosophy of the proprietor does not hurt the business he owns. Hinds often urges Jurgis to detail the horrendous filth of the meat-packing plants along with the real recipes for tinned meats and sausages. Jurgis takes up the socialist cause with a passion. He endeavors to read newspapers, including The Appeal to Reason, and learn all about the political and economic systems of power in America. He becomes angry and frustrated when he cannot sway people to socialism"

He realizes that Chad and Madame have left Paris so they can find a nice quiet inn outside the city and, ahem, engage in a sexual relationship. Of course, Strether tries to act cool about it once he sees that Madame de Vionnet has recognized him. While they're all thinking, \"God, Strether totally knows about what's been going on this whole time.\" This is followed by a super awkward dinner, where Chad and Madame can only think about how ol' third-wheel Strether is blowing their chance at sex. While Strether is thinking that his whole life has been a lie since getting to Paris. When Strether leaves them and goes home, he realizes that all along, he's been allowing himself to enjoy Paris because he has enjoyed being among young women and men while still thinking to himself that he wasn't doing anything morally wrong. But now his image of a perfect Chad and perfect Madame de Vionnet has been shattered, and he doesn't know what to believe anymore. Worse yet, Chad and Madame's sexual relationship means that on some level, Sarah Pocock was right all along. Strether was just too blind to see it.",

Strether looks up and sees him smoking a cigarette and leaning over the balcony railing, just like the artist Bilham did when Strether first came to Paris. The memory makes Strether nostalgic about the days before he knew about Chad and Madame de Vionnet. Finally, Strether pipes up and tells Chad that he'll be a monster if he ever leaves Madame de Vionnet. It looks like this is that one last favor Strether told Madame he would do for her. Chad says that he would probably never do this, but probably ain't good enough for Strether. Strether says that he wants this to be the last thing he says to Chad during their time in Paris. So he repeats himself: do not leave Madame...EVER. Chad asks what all of this \"last thing I say\" stuff is all about, and Strether tells him that he's leaving Paris. Chad tells Strether that he's been away in England all week because sometimes a guy just feels like he needs to get away. Again, this is something Strether can sympathize with. Chad tells Strether that everything will be fine between him and Madame.

        "Strether sees a boat coming around the bend in the river, and he is surprised to discover that the two occupants are Madame de Vionnet and Chad. He is horrified to realize that \"they would show nothing if they could feel sure he hadn't made them out.\" Deciding that there is only one course of action open to him, Strether calls out with \"surprise and joy,\" and they respond by turning the boat to shore. The couple's discomfiture forces Strether to the truth that Madame de Vionnet is Chad's mistress: \"Her shawl and Chad's overcoat and her other garments, and his, those they had each worn the day before, were at the place, best known to themselves -- a quiet retreat enough, no doubt -- at which they had been spending the twenty-four hours.\" Strether is disillusioned as much with Chad as he is to learn of the affair; Chad, he acknowledges, \"habitually left things to others, as Strether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration of his famous knowing how to live.\" In the quiet of his room, Strether thinks of his next visit with Maria Gostrey with some apprehension. Thinking how he would respond to Maria's inevitable question , Strether \"recognized at last that he had really been trying all along to suppose nothing.\"",
        "Concerned by Chad's unlikely disappearance, Strether goes to the young man's apartment to see if he has returned. Chad is there, having in fact just returned from a trip to London, and he greets Strether warmly. As they talk, it occurs to Strether that he could stay in Paris with Chad indefinitely. This raises a moment of regret in Strether's mind, but he finally tells Chad he has come to bid him goodbye. He also has one more thing to say: \"You'll be a brute, you know -- you'll be guilty of the last infamy -- if you ever forsake her.\" Chad protests the idea and says he doesn't know what should make Strether feel he is tired of Madame de Vionnet. \"Strether didn't quite know, either, and such impressions, for the imaginative mind, were always too fine, too floating, to produce on the spot their warrant.\" He reminds Chad of all Madame de Vionnet has done for him and says, \"I remember you, you know, as you were.\" As he walks Strether back to his hotel, Chad suddenly announces a revived interest in the art of advertising, and Strether wonders if he will give up Madame de Vionnet after all. Chad denies the possibility, but Strether's parting remark to Chad is \"You're restless.\""

        "Newland and his wife and mother go to the Opera. Mrs. van der Luyden comments that she saw Catherine1s carriage parked outside of the Beaufort1s home. May quickly lies for Catherine saying that she is certain that the carriage was there without Catherine knowing. The van der Luydens realize that Ellen had taken the carriage to the Beauforts. Mrs. Archer tries to make excuses: \"Imprudent people are often kind. Newland watches the Opera with some disgust thinking, \"the same large blonde victim is succumbing to the same small brown seducer. May is wearing her wedding dress for the first time in two years. Wharton explains that \"it was the custom, in old New York, for brides to appear in this costly garment during the first year or two of marriage. Newland decides that he absolutely must leave and whispers to May that he has a beastly headache and wants to go home. Stepping out of the carriage, May tears her wedding dress. Newland asks if she1d like some brandy \"because she looks very pale\" but May blushes and says no. Newland tries to talk to May about Ellen; but May cleverly guides the conversation to explain that Ellen will be returning to Europe soon. Newland is obviously shaken by the news and May leaves the room quietly saying \"my head aches too.",
        "Archer spends all the next day at the office, so he doesn't see May until they leave for a dinner given by the van der Luydens. After discussing the Beauforts's ruin and Ellen's questionable visit to Regina Beaufort, the dinner party goes off to see Faust at the opera. At the opera house, Archer notices that his wife is wearing her bridal satin, which many brides wear for the first year or two of marriage in New York. Archer goes to his wife's box and tells her that he has a headache and would like to return home. Once inside, Archer begins to confess to his wife about his feelings for Madame Olenska, but he only gets as far as saying Madame Olenska's name when May announces that Madame Olenska has already left town, that she's gone to Washington, D.C., to pack up and move to Paris, with Mrs. Manson Mingott's approval. Archer is astonished. May shows Archer a letter Ellen wrote to her, and Archer breaks out laughing.",
        "Archer is stunned upon leaving Mrs. Mingott's. He reasons that Ellen's decision to stay in New York must be an indication that she has resolved to have an affair with him. While Archer is somewhat relieved that she will be staying, he is also afraid that their affair will be no different than those of his peers and that it will dissolve into a pathetic pack of lies. Yet he consoles himself with the thought that he and Ellen are different from the rest of New York society and that their unique situation puts them above the judgment of their clan. That evening, he waits in front of Beaufort's house for Ellen, who we learn has come to console Regina Beaufort in the midst of her troubles. The following day, Archer meets Ellen in the antiquities gallery of the museum. Ellen explains that she has decided to stay near her grandmother because she feels she will be safe there from the temptation of Archer. She begs him not to let them become like the other adulterers they know. Archer agrees, and they plan to meet two days later. Back home that evening, Archer learns from May that she too has seen Ellen that afternoon. May claims that the two of them have had a long talk and that May has decided to befriend Ellen despite her eccentricities. At dinner, the topic of discussion is again the Beauforts' financial failure. The van der Luydens are dismayed to learn that Ellen had been to see Mrs. Beaufort, an action they conceive of as imprudent, considering the Beauforts' fall from good society. At the opera, Archer feels guilty about his intended tryst with Ellen. At his side, May is wearing her wedding dress, as is the custom for young married women. Archer suddenly feels the urge to confess to her, and he persuades May to leave the opera early. Back home, Archer is on the verge of confessing when May interrupts him by mentioning that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. Archer is stunned and excuses himself for bed."

        "Miss Prism is sitting at the table while Cecily is in the back, watering the flowers. Miss Prism calls to Cecily to stop doing such a mundane task as watering the flowers because she needs to do her German grammar lesson. Cecily argues that she doesn't want to because she knows she looks plain after her German lesson. Miss Prism retorts that Uncle Jack is only looking out for Cecily's education. Cecily complains that Uncle Jack is so serious. This piques Cecily's interest and she wishes aloud that Uncle Jack would bring Ernest by sometime so that Miss Prism could reform him. Miss Prism tells Cecily to work on her lesson. At the sight of him, Miss Prism blushes and stands. They're so obviously crushing on each other that Cecily finds it easy to persuade them to take a walk together. While they're out, Merriman the butler tells Cecily that a Mr. Ernest Worthing has just arrived. Cecily is overjoyed to finally be able to meet the infamous Ernest, but she's scared at the same time. Algernon enters, disguised as Ernest. They talk about how \"wicked\" he is, with Cecily making comments about how he should reform himself. Charmingly, Algernon/Ernest asks Cecily to try to reform him that very afternoon. As they're flirting and Ernest is finding every way possible to compliment Cecily, like asking for a pink rose for his button-hole \"because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily\" . Algernon learns that Jack plans to send Ernest to Australia. As Cecily's putting a flower into his buttonhole, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return, discussing the moral advantages and disadvantages of marriage. They're so wrapped up in each other that they don't realize that Cecily is not where they left her. Before they can send out a search party, Jack arrives home, dressed in a black suit of mourning. When they ask him about it, Jack announces that he's returned early because his brother Ernest is dead. When Dr. Chasuble offers to perform a funeral ceremony for Ernest, Jack suddenly remembers something. He asks Dr. Chasuble if he can be christened. After some questions, Dr. Chasuble relents and they arrange for Jack to come by at half-past five that evening. Cecily comes from the house to meet her Uncle Jack with the happy news that his brother Ernest arrived just recently and is now in the dining-room. The mystery is solved when Jack sees Algernon sitting at the table. Jack refuses to shake hands with Algernon. We learn from Cecily that Ernest has been telling her about his poor friend, Mr. Bunbury. Finally, Cecily declares she will never speak to Uncle Jack again if he doesn't shake hands with Ernest. Jack gives in reluctantly and Miss Prism praises Cecily for her wonderful act of kindness today. They leave Jack and Ernest together. Furiously, Jack tells Algy to leave at once. But he's interrupted when Merriman comes in to reveal that Mr. Ernest's luggage has been put in the bedroom next to Jack's. Jack tells Merriman that unfortunately Ernest's dog-cart has arrived to take him away; he's been called back to town. While Jack rants at Algernon, Algernon talks about how pretty Cecily is. Jack declares the dog-cart is here and leaves, just in time to miss Algy's comment that he has fallen in love with Cecily. She and Ernest/Algernon exchange glances. She pleads with Merriman to let Ernest stay for another five minutes. Algernon informs her that Jack is sending him away and compliments her beauty. Flattered, Cecily begins copying his words down in her diary, but refuses to let him look at it. Without ceremony, he asks Cecily to marry him. She responds amusedly that they've been engaged for months. Apparently, Ernest proposed on Valentine's day but they'd broken it off a month later. Ernest kisses her for being so forgiving. Distraught, he asks her if she could love him under any other name... say... Algernon, for instance. Cecily finds it a rather aristocratic name, but no, she wouldn't be able to love him then. At that declaration, Ernest/Algernon promptly begins asking her about the rector and whether or not he performs christenings. Algernon leaves to find Dr. Chasuble about a very important matter. As he leaves, Cecily comments that she likes his hair so much. Soon, Merriman enters to tell Cecily that a Miss Fairfax has arrived to see Mr. Worthing. Cecily invites Miss Fairfax to sit with her until Uncle Jack comes out. They're both such charming girls that when they meet, they declare they'll be best friends and call each other immediately by their first names. They talk for a little while before Gwendolen works up the balls to ask Cecily if she can inspect her. Gwendolen, peering through her glasses, finds Cecily rather too attractive and loudly wishes that she were a bit older and more decidedly more dowdy. She asks about Cici's relations and finds out that Mr. Worthing is Cecily's guardian. Now that's problematic, Gwendolen says, since Ernest never mentioned it to her. When Cecily hears the name Ernest, she quickly explains the situation. It's not Ernest Worthing who is my guardian, she says sweetly, but his older brother, Jack. That's a relief to Gwendolen, who suddenly becomes polite again. Cecily proudly declares that she's going to be Ernest Worthing's wife. Ernest proposed to me yesterday. Cecily retorts that he must've changed his mind because he just proposed to her ten minutes ago. The two women eye each other coldly before Gwendolen announces--alluding to Cecily's rude manners--that they obviously move in different social circles. Right before they can start clawing at each other, Merriman comes by to arrange their tea things. As Merriman serves them, they glare at each other but chitchat in cordial tones. When Cecily serves Gwendolen tea, she serves it in the opposite manner that Gwendolen requests--giving her lots of sugar in her tea and cake instead of bread and butter. Thank goodness, Jack arrives just in time to break up their fight. When Gwendolen jumps on him and asks if he's to be married to Cecily, Jack laughs it off and kisses Gwendolen. Cecily replies that he's not Ernest Worthing; that's Uncle Jack. At the unglamorous name, Gwendolen recoils in disgust. Right on cue, Algernon enters and Cecily goes through the same routine with him. When he confirms he's not to be married to Gwendolen, she allows him to kiss her. This time it's Gwendolen's turn to clear up the confusion. She reveals that he's not Ernest Worthing; it's Algernon Moncrieff, her cousin. Cecily backs away when she hears \"Algernon.\" The two women embrace each other in distress, while the men hang their heads in shame. They finally ask Jack who Ernest is and he is forced to admit that Ernest doesn't exist. When both girls realize with horror that neither of them are engaged to Ernest, they agree to go into the house where the men won't dare to follow them. With scornful looks, they leave. They argue for a while and Algernon sits down agitatedly and begins to eat the muffins left by the ladies. In the midst of their squabbling, each discovers that the other has a christening to attend that evening to be named Ernest. Their christenings are scheduled only fifteen minutes apart! Both try to dissuade each other from doing so, without success."

They flirt with him a bit, and then Widow Quin enters, announcing that she has registered Christy for the sports competition happening down on the beach. The women expect that he will prove a peerless athlete. As the girls and the widow prepare breakfast for him, Christy fleshes out the story of the murder. His father had ordered Christy to marry a fat, ugly widow-woman twice his age. When Christy refused, his father threatened him with a scythe, and Christy in turn threatened his father with a spade. When his father struck at him, Christy feinted and then delivered the fatal blow to the older man's skull. Susan teases that the Lord God has sent Christy to their village to wed the Widow Quin. Pegeen enters to see the toast, and kicks the women out. She then accuses Christy of flirting, which he denies. When he counters that the women were interested in his story, she insinuates that they will gossip about him and hence increase his chances of being apprehended.

While Christy is gone, Shawn promises Widow Quin a ewe if she can interrupt the burgeoning relationship between Pegeen and the stranger. The widow asks what Shawn would pay if she could get Christy to marry her, and Shawn names just about everything he owns. After giving his compliments, Shawn races out. Christy continues to prance about, imagining a future of fine clothes and gifts celebrating his triumphant deed. Christy hides just as Old Mahon enters. Old Mahon immediately inquires whether the widow has seen a young fellow, whom he has been tracking for ten days. He removes his hat to reveal a vicious, semi-bandaged wound, and then describes the young fellow as his stupid, useless, and dirty son. He further describes the son - Christy, of course - as too weak to drink or smoke a pipe, and as absurdly fearful of women. In fact, Christy is the butt of his own townswomen's jokes. Mahon exits abruptly to chase after this lead. His father gone, Christy wonders why the man pretended to be dead, and wishes a violent death for him now. Christy then grows suddenly tearful as he imagines losing the new life with Pegeen that he was on the verge of beginning. The widow softly suggests that she and Christy are alike in character, each with a melancholy side that accompanies having killed a close relation. She begins to paint a picture of a tender future they might share together, but Christy hardly hears her, as the sound of the approaching girls interrupts them. Christy begs the widow to help him win Pegeen. Just like that, Widow Quin relinquishes her own design on Christy, and agrees to keep his secret. If Old Mahon should return, she will swear he is a lunatic. Sarah, Honor and Susan enter to lead Christy down to the beach so he can compete in the sports."

        "At the Cardinal's palace in Rome, Julia, the Cardinal's mistress and Castruccio's wife, explains how she convinced her husband to let her go to Rome without him. Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out",
        "Scene Four is set at the Shrine of Our Lady of Loretto. Here, the Cardinal gives up his cardinal's hat in a ceremony so that he can fight as a soldier. Antonio, the Duchess, and their children arrive, and are banished from Ancona. This all happens in pantomime while the churchmen sing a solemn song. They all exit except for two pilgrims, who discuss what happened and explain that the Pope, spurred by the Cardinal, took the Duchess's dukedom from her",
        "Scene Four returns to the residence of the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. The Cardinal tells them not to stay with Ferdinand tonight because having people around makes him worse, although in reality he simply wants to ensure that no one is around when he gets rid of Julia's body. He further tells them of a plan to imitate Ferdinand's insanity in an attempt to get his confidence, and so they should ignore any extreme sounds or cries they might hear. They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. Everyone leaves except the Cardinal. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. The Cardinal exits, and Bosola enters, having overheard the Cardinal's plan to kill him. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally. Before he dies, Bosola tells Antonio what happened to his family. Bosola is devastated by his mistake, and tells the servant to take Antonio's body to Julia's room",
        "We're in Rome. The Cardinal is talking to Castruchio's wife Julia, saying something along the lines of, \"so, what did you tell your husband this time to get yourself out here?\" Julia and the Cardinal. Things that are not playing chess or discussing Plato or praying. Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. A servant comes to tell Julia that Delio and Castruchio have both come to Rome, and that Delio's waiting outside to see her. The Cardinal leaves, and Delio comes in. Turns out Delio used to have a thing for Julia, and the first thing he does is offer Julia money. Julia doesn't know what's up, until Delio tells her he'd really appreciate it if she'd become his mistress. You know, when she's not with Castruchio. It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess. Julia's admirably quick on the draw: \"Sure, you know what, Delio, I'll get right back to you; lemme go ask my husband what he thinks.\" She leaves Delio alone, who's getting really worried. He hears that the Cardinal is enraged about some letter he's received from Malfi, and fears that somehow Antonio's marriage to the Duchess has been revealed.",
        "We're at Loretto, where Bosola advised the Duchess travel, watching two pilgrims as they watch the Cardinal undergo the ceremony for transforming into a soldier. They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished. The pilgrims still think it's unjust and nasty, especially that part where the Cardinal ripped off her wedding ring.",
        "The Cardinal is making Malateste and Pescara swear that they won't watch over Ferdinand tonight, or come out of their bedrooms even if they hear a ruckus. He says he wants them to stay put because he doesn't want Ferdinand to be bothered at all, but really he just wants to be sure that he can dispose of Julia's body in peace. The Cardinal has arranged for Bosola to come pick up the body, and plans to himself that he's going kill Bosola once he's completed the jobs he's given him. Plans to murder your minions are best kept in your head: Bosola hears him, and knows what's up. Ferdinand the Crazy wanders in and then out, talking to himself. Antonio comes in, saying to himself that he hopes he catches the Cardinal while he's praying, so that maybe he'll be in the mood to forgive him. Bosola, not being able to see that it's Antonio, and, thinking he's some random murder, interprets his words as \"I hope I'll kill that Bosola while he's praying, maybe the Cardinal will pardon me then.\" Quickly, Bosola comes forward and wounds Antonio, only to immediately thereafter discover that it's Antonio, the very guy he was hoping to save. Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered. Why on earth he should tell the dying Antonio that his family is dead when he'd previously lied to the Duchess about the same thing is kind of confusing. Antonio, finally knowing the truth, tells Bosola he just wants to die. He dies, after he voices his final wish that his remaining son be raised away from the courts, and that his body be given to Delio. Bosola takes his body to where he was supposed to put Julia's body. Quick thing to note: this is the third time the audience has watched Bosola drag a dead body offstage."

        "Inside Petruchio's country abode, Grumio is busy making a fire and complaining about the cold in preparation for his master and mistress' arrival. Curtis, another of Petruchio's servants, has not yet met the new bride and asks if she is as shrewish as reported. Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Hortensio states that he has decided to wed a wealthy widow instead of Bianca, leaving \"Cambio\" to woo Bianca alone. Biondello rushes in to aid their attempt, claiming that an old Pedant from Mantua approaches. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. He demands that Katharina thank him for the meat while telling Hortensio to eat it all himself. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt. Tranio offers his own house, noting that the banquet will not be a grand affair but promising a better one later on in Pisa. Lucentio and Bianca, meanwhile, on Biondello's advice, elope to be married post-haste while Baptista is with Tranio and the Pedant. In scene five, Kate and Petruchio are on the road to Padua again. Petruchio continues his shrewish behavior, insisting that the sun is the moon and threatening to turn the cart around if Kate doesn't agree. Kate finally begins to play along, agreeing that the sun is the moon and then changing her opinion when Petruchio changes his. This game is interrupted by the appearance of the real Vincentio, Lucentio's father, whom Petruchio refers to as a \"gentlewoman\" ; he insists that Kate agree, and she does so, calling him a \"budding virgin.\" A bit shaken by their jesting, Vincentio introduces himself, noting that he is on his way to Padua to visit his son. Petruchio informs the man that they are now family - for Lucentio has married the sister of Katharina. Vincentio is shocked and asks Petruchio if he is joking. Petruchio assures him that he is not and invites Vincentio along. The party leaves, after which Hortensio, alone on the stage, confides that he is encouraged and will now go to the widow he intends to wed.",
        "Back in Padua, Tranio and the Pedant wait for Baptista outside his house. The Pedant is introduced to Baptista as Vincentio and the two men seem pleased with one another and the kids' engagement. They all agree to go to Lucentio's place to settle their business and sign some contracts. Baptista sends \"Cambio\" to fetch Bianca and tell her the good news about her upcoming marriage to Lucentio. Instead of fetching Bianca and taking her to her dad, Lucentio catches up with Biondello, who brings him up to speed on the arrangements for his elopement with Bianca. While Baptista is kept busy signing fake contracts with Tranio and the Pedant , Bianca and Lucentio will go to St. Luke's church, where a priest is waiting. Biondello tells Lucentio to get to the church ASAP and to make sure he has some reliable witnesses to confirm the marriage. Lucentio runs off to find Bianca.",
        "Lucentio and Bianca head to the church to be married while her father is busy making arrangements with Tranio and the Pedant. Petruchio, Kate, Vincentio, and Grumio arrive in Padua and stop at Lucentio's house. Vincentio insists his companions join him for a drink, but upon knocking at the door and announcing himself, he is surprised to find another man who claims to be Lucentio's father. When Biondello appears, Vincentio questions him. Biondello pretends not to recognize his master's father. When Tranio comes to investigate the commotion, he too pretends not to know Vincentio. When the Pedant defends Tranio, claiming he's Lucentio, Vincentio moans that Tranio must have murdered the real Lucentio and assumed his persona. Baptista, unwilling to put up with such wild behavior, orders Vincentio to prison. At this point the newlyweds, Lucentio and Bianca, return. Lucentio explains what has happened, why Tranio was masquerading as his master, and announces his marriage to Bianca. Baptista and Vincentio reconcile minimally and enter the house to untangle the situation in which they find themselves. Gremio, realizing he has no hope for a spouse, goes inside to join the wedding feast. Petruchio asks Kate for a kiss, and when she refuses, he threatens to return home again. Good humoredly, she kisses her husband before heading in to the feast.",
        "In Padua, Tranio has properly outfitted the pedant as Vincentio and rehearses his act with him to ensure that their stories match. When Baptista and Lucentio enter, the pedant convinces Baptista that he is indeed Lucentio's father, and that he fully approves of the marriage between Bianca and his son. Baptista, the pedant, and Tranio then leave to find a private place where they can discuss the financial details of the marriage"
