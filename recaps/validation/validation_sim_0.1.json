        "George is still with Sir Dedlock, now recuperating at Chesney Wold. George is kind of overwhelmed by how important his brother has apparently become and wants to turn back...but doesn't. He keeps going, finds the Rouncewell factory , and walks into his brother's office. George introduces himself as Mr. Steel, but as soon as he opens his mouth, his brother recognizes him and is hugely thrilled to see him. George is floored. They go to Rouncewell's house, which is fancy. There's an engagement party going on for Watt and Rosa, and George becomes the guest of honor. The next day George tells his brother that he's happy except for one thing: he wants to be removed from Mrs. Rouncewell's will. He doesn't want to take money away from his nieces and nephews, and it's making him feel awful. His brother tells him that his mom isn't going to do any such thing. This makes George happy. His brother immediately offers him a job, but George says he's best off helping out Sir Dedlock for now. His brother is sort of not into this, but George explains that they are different people and that George really likes being commanded, like he was in the army. Finally George shows his brother a letter he's written to Esther explaining that he only passed along Captain Hawdon's note as a handwriting sample, and that if he'd known Hawdon was alive he would have found him and taken care of him. Apparently Hawdon was presumed drowned after falling overboard.",
        "George Rouncewell has given up the shooting gallery and is now a constant companion to Sir Leicester. One day, however, he rides north to \"the iron country\" and visits his brother. He also meets his nephew, Watt Rouncewell, and Watt's bride-to-be, Rosa. George is offered a job, turns it down, but agrees to give Rosa away at the wedding. Then he writes to Esther, telling her that the letter written to him long ago by Captain Hawdon, the one taken by Detective Bucket, was a note of no particular consequence.

        "\"Steel and Iron\" The narrator says that George's Shooting Gallery is closed now and that George lives at Chesney Wold. George rides into the iron country and seeks out the Rouncewells, who are well known in the town. When George reaches the factory, he meets his brother's son, who leads George to his brother. He doesn't immediately identify himself, but his brother quickly recognizes him. His brother says they must celebrate their reunion and that a celebration has already been planned for his son Watt, who is going to be married. George accompanies them to their house and meets his nieces and Rosa. The next day, the brother tells George how he might join the business, but George asks him to promise that he'll get Mrs. Rouncewell to remove George from her will. He doesn't want his brother's and nieces' inheritance to be reduced because of him, a wayward son. His brother refuses and says his mother will never agree. George assures him that their fortunes will not be reduced and that he'll give up any part of the will he receives. He also says he can't join the iron business. Before George leaves, he asks his brother to read a letter he's written. It's to Esther, and it explains that he received a letter from Bucket that had been addressed to him by \"a certain person\" and was found among this certain person's papers. He wants Esther to know that the letter was a list of instructions from overseas about how he should go about sending a letter, which had been enclosed, to a young woman in England. George says that he gave up the letter because he thought it was needed only as a handwriting sample and that he never meant to cause any harm. George also says that if he'd known \"a certain unfortunate gentleman\" was alive, he would have helped him, but this person had been reported drowned. George sends the letter and returns to Chesney Wold",
        "Steel and Iron George is letting his shooting gallery and moving to Chesney Wold to keep Sir Leicester's hunting lodge. Meanwhile, he travels north the industrial town where his brother owns iron factories. He looks up Mr. Rouncewell but calls himself, \"Steel.\" At first his brother is fooled, but then he recognizes George. The brothers joyfully reunite and make a visit home to find his son Watt and future daughter-in-law, Rosa, who will complete her education in Germany before getting married. George will give her away at the wedding. His brother offers him a job, but George says it isn't in his line. George wants to help Sir Leicester now, but his brother is scornful of his joining \"the household brigade\" . George finally shows his brother the letter he is sending Esther. It is the letter of her father's that he had given Tulkinghorn. He tells Esther that if he had known her father was alive, he would have shared his last farthing with him, but he had been reported dead."

        "The next night, Tom and Huck sneak out and start digging with their case knives. They tire soon and their hands quickly develop blisters, but it seems they haven't accomplished anything. Tom finally sighs and agrees to use a pick and shovel, but only as long as they pretend to be using case knives. Huck agrees and tells Tom his head is getting \"leveler\" all the time. The next day, they steal some tin plates and a brass candlestick for Jim to write with. They also finish digging the hole and make it possible for Jim to crawl out. Jim wants to escape immediately, but Tom then tells Jim all about the little things he needs to do first, including writing in blood, throwing the tin plates out of the hut, etc. Jim thinks all of these ideas are a little crazy, but agrees to do it. Tom then convinces the man who brings Jim his food that Jim is bewitched and offers to heal him by baking a pie, in which he plans to conceal the sheet ladder. Chapter 37 Aunt Sally notices that she has lost a sheet, a shirt, six candles, a spoon and a brass candlestick. Very confused by the strange disappearances, she becomes absolutely livid. Aunt Sally yells at poor Silas, who eventually discovers the missing spoon in his pocket, where Tom had placed it. He looks ashamed and promises her he has no idea how the spoon got into his pocket. Aunt Sally then yells at everyone to get away from her and let her get some peace and quiet. Tom decides that the only way to steal back the spoon is to confuse his poor Aunt Sally even further. Tom has Huck hide one of spoons while Aunt Sally counts them, and then Huck puts it back when Aunt Sally counts again. By the time she has finished counting, Aunt Sally has no idea exactly how many spoons she has, and Tom is able to take one without any more trouble. Tom then does the same thing with the sheet, by stealing one out of her closet and putting it on the clothesline, only to remove it the next day. The boys bake Jim a witches pie, in which they hide the rope. It takes them several hours to get it right because the pie is so large, but they finally succeed. The man who normally takes Jim his food takes the pie in to him, and Jim happily removes the rope. Chapter 38 Tom designs a coat-of-arms for Jim to inscribe on the walls so as to permanently leave his mark on the prison cell. Next, Tom works out three mournful inscriptions and tells Jim he must carve them into a rock. Huck and Tom go to fetch an old grindstone for Jim to use as his rock, but it is too heavy for them to carry, so they are forced to allow Jim to leave his \"prison\" and come help them. Jim rolls the rock into the hut and sets to work on the inscriptions. Tom decides that Jim needs some cell companions, such as snakes and spiders. He tells Jim that he and Huck will find some for him, but Jim is vehemently opposed to the idea. Tom then tries to convince Jim to get a flower so he can water it with his tears. Jim replies that the flower would not last very long. Tom finally gets frustrated, and gives up for the night. Chapter 39 Huck and Tom spend the next day catching creatures to live with Jim in his cell. They first gather about fifteen rats, but Aunt Sally's son frees them by accident and both Tom and Huck receive beatings for bringing rats into her house. Determined, the boys catch another fifteen rats, along with some spiders, caterpillars, frogs, and bugs. At the end of the day they gather some garter snakes and put them in a bag, but after dinner they discover all the snakes escaped in the house as well. Huck remarks that there was no shortage of snakes in the house for quite a while after that. Uncle Silas decides to start advertising Jim as a runaway slave in some of the local newspapers because he has failed to receive a reply to his earlier letters. Since the plantation to which he wrote never existed, it makes sense that he never received a reply. Tom figures out how to stop Silas, by planting anonymous letters that warn him off this plan of action. Tom and Huck first plant a letter reading, \"Beware. The next night the boys tack up a letter containing a skull and crossbones, which they follow with a picture of a coffin. Tom plans a final coup by drafting a longer letter. Pretending to be a member of a gang of robbers who are planning to steal Jim from the family, he warns them that the gang will be coming late at night from the north to get Jim. The family is terribly frightened and does not know what to do. Chapter 40 The letter has a strong effect, and over fifteen armed farmers are sitting in the house waiting for the robbers to come during the night of the escape. Huck is frightened for their safety when he slips out the window and tells Tom they must leave immediately or they will be shot. Tom gets very excited when he hears about how many people came to catch them. As Tom, Huck and Jim start to move away from the hut, Tom gets caught on the fence and his britches rip quite loudly. All three start to run, and the farmers shoot after them. When they get to a dark area, Huck, Jim, and Tom hide behind a bush and let the whole pack of farmers and dogs run past them. Once safe, they proceed to where the raft is hidden and Tom tells Jim he is a free man again, and that he will always be a free man from now on. Jim thanks him and tells him it was a great escape plan. Tom then shows them where he got a bullet in the leg, but Jim is worried for Tom's health. Jim rips up one of the Duke's old shirts and ties up the leg with it. Jim tells Tom that he is not going to move until they get a doctor there and make sure he is safe. Tom gets mad at both of them and yells, but Huck ignores him and gets the canoe ready to go to town. Tom makes him promise to blindfold the doctor before bringing him back to their hiding place.",
        "Tom and Huck capture several rats to put in Jim's cabin, but one of the Phelps boys finds the box and lets all of the rats free into the house. After several creatures are accidentally freed in the Phelps' house, Tom and Huck finally capture enough rats, spiders, and snakes, and put them in Jim's cabin. Jim complains that there is not enough room for him, and if he ever becomes free he \"wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\" After three weeks, everything is finally ready for the grand escape. To finish off the scheme, Tom writes an anonymous letter to the Phelps saying that a \"desperate gang of cutthroats\" will attempt to steal Jim out of the cabin. Huck returns to the house to pick up some butter and finds that the Phelps have gathered 15 men to battle the gang of cutthroats. Alarmed, Huck sneaks out the window and warns Tom that the men are here, and they must all escape immediately. When the men come to the cabin, Jim and the boys slip out of the hole and head for the river amidst shouts and gunshots. They make it to the raft but then discover that Tom has been shot in the calf. Tom tells them to shove off, but Jim will not leave until a doctor has looked at Tom.",
        "Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas, rattled by the mysterious letter, send Tom and Huck to bed right after supper. Later that night, Huck sees that fifteen uneasy local farmers with guns have gathered in the front room of the house. Huck goes to the shed to warn Jim and Tom, but news of the armed men only excites Tom even more. Suddenly, the men attack the shed. In the darkness, Tom, Huck, and Jim escape through the hole they cut in the wall. Tom makes a noise going over the fence, attracting the attention of the men, who shoot at the boys and Jim as they run. They make it to their canoe and set off downstream toward the island where the raft is hidden. They delight in their success, especially Tom, who has a bullet in the leg as a souvenir. Huck and Jim are concerned about Tom's wound, and Jim says they should get a doctor, since Tom would if the situation were reversed. Jim's statement confirms Huck's belief that Jim is \"white inside"

        "Huck quickly locates a doctor and tells him that his brother \"had a dream . . . and it shot him.\" The doctor heads for the raft but will not let Huck come along because the canoe is too small. Exhausted, Huck falls asleep until the next morning. When he wakes up, he runs into Uncle Silas, and the two of them go back to the Phelps farm, which is full of local men discussing the strange cabin and its contents. The farmers decide that Jim must have been helped by several slaves and the writing is some sort of \"secret African\" language. The next day, Tom and Jim arrive at the Phelps' with the doctor and several of the farmers. Tom is on a mattress and Jim has his hands tied. The men argue whether or not to hang Jim, and the doctor explains how Jim helped with Tom instead of running away. The next morning Tom wakes up and begins to tell Aunt Sally how he and \"Tom\" orchestrated the entire escape. Tom relishes the retelling until he hears that Jim is still in captivity. Tom rises up in bed and demands that they free Jim because he has known all along that Miss Watson had died and set Jim free in her will. At that moment, Aunt Polly arrives, and Tom and Huck are forced to reveal their true identities.",
        "Tom does not return, and Silas's efforts to find him end in vain. In the meantime, a letter arrives from Aunt Polly, Sally's sister. Sally casts the letter aside when she sees Tom, who she thinks is Sid. The boy is brought in semi-conscious on a mattress, accompanied by a crowd including Jim, in chains, and the doctor. Some of the local men would like to hang Jim but are unwilling to risk having to compensate Jim's master. The doctor intervenes, telling the crowd how Jim has sacrificed his freedom to help nurse Tom. Sally, meanwhile, stays at Tom's bedside, glad that his condition has improved. Tom wakes and gleefully details how they set Jim free. Horrified to learn that Jim is now in chains, Tom explains that Miss Watson died two months ago and that her will stipulated that Jim should be set free. The old woman regretted ever having considered selling Jim down the river. Just then, Aunt Polly walks into the room. She has come to Arkansas from St. Petersburg after receiving a letter from Sally mentioning that Sid Sawyer--Tom's alias--had arrived with \"Tom\"--who was actually Huck. Tom has been intercepting communications between the sisters, and Polly has been forced to appear in person to sort out the confusion. After a tearful reunion with Sally, she identifies Tom and Huck and yells at both boys for their misadventures"

        "I will\" and a naming of things which belong to him, such as his hands and his spirit, Equality 7-2521 explains that he has found his answer. He stands on the mountain's peak and spreads his arms, knowing that his existence is the answer. He needs no reason to exist because he is his own reason. He names his eyes and ears as the organs which give significance and beauty to the world. His mind and his judgment are the only things that can find truth, and his will is the only thing that can make his choices. Some words are wise and others are false, but only the words \"I will it\" are holy. He knows now that he is the end of his journey, and he does not care of the overall significance of the earth because he knows about happiness. The fulfillment of happiness, in his view, is its own purpose. Furthermore, he refuses to be a tool for anyone else's accomplishments or happiness. Declaring himself to be a man and his own miracle, he decides that he cannot share or give away his treasures of thought, will, and especially freedom. He cannot help \"the poor of spirit\" by giving up his own spirit. He owes nothing to his brothers, but neither does he require anything of them. In particular, he states that he is not by default a friend or an enemy to other men because love and honor must be earned. However, he will seek friends that he respects rather than slaves or master in an unequal power relationship. They are individuals and do not need to be together except if they wish. Continuing to speak in the first person singular, Equality 7-2521 rejects the use of the word \"We\" as the default word. The collectivism implicit in the word \"We\" does nothing but cause stagnation and the sapping away of the strength of the good, the wise, and the strong. Life is nothing if every man is subject to all others. He declares himself as \"done with this creed of corruption.\" He is finished with the slavery conveyed by the word \"We.\" In its place, he substitutes the word \"I,\" which is the god that will give men control over the earth and over their own lives.",
        "Equality 7-2521 has finally discovered the first-person singular. At last, he tells us, he's found \"the words,\" and \"the answer,\" he was looking for. He, himself, is the meaning of things. Equality 7-2521 needs no reason or \"warrant\" to be. He is his own reason for being. His own will is the only thing he needs to obey. Equality 7-2521 has realized his own happiness is his highest end. He needs no higher end to justify it, because it's the purpose of his life. He does not need to justify his life by serving others. In fact, Equality 7-2521 doesn't owe anything to anyone. If he's going to love anyone else, that person has got to earn it. The word, \"we,\" is a dangerous word, Equality 7-2521 says. Actually, it's the root of all evil. If it's made the most important word, that is. It allows the weak to steal from the strong. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is done with \"we.\" It is a monster. Now, instead, he sees the face of god. God is \"I.\"",
        "I will.\" So opens the chapter in which Equality 7-2521 re-discovers the lost and holy word, the forbidden idea for which the Saint of the Pyre was burned at the stake. The acquisition of this knowledge fulfills the intellectual quest on which Equality 7-2521 had embarked as a 10-year-old -- the attempt to discover and understand the Unspeakable Word. He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He had wished to find a warrant for being, but now understands that he needs neither warrant nor sanction. He is the warrant and sanction of his existence. He is overcome with the emotional experience of his intellectual realization: he has a right to his own life. He is not a mere appendage of a group. He can choose his own path in life -- his own interests, his own profession, his own wife, his own home. He is a free man, able to choose his goals, and then work strenuously to achieve them. Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service. An individual is \"not a sacrifice on their altars.\" Equality 7-2521 realizes, after studying the books of the Unmentionable Times, what the proper relation is between individuals. He owes no unchosen obligations to his brothers and sisters, nor do they owe him such. He states that he is neither a friend nor a foe to others, \"but such as each of them shall deserve.\" Love, he claims, must be earned -- and that requires more than the sheer fact of being born; it requires the attainment of virtue. Equality 7-2521 will choose friends from among his fellow humans, but neither masters nor servants. He says that he will love and respect his friends, but neither command nor obey them. And when humans come together in friendship and in love, they will join hands only beyond each one's \"holy threshold,\" and each will respect the personal boundaries of the other. Looking back on his past life in the city -- and thinking sorrowfully of those innocent people still trapped there -- he realizes that the horrors of his former society are the result of destroying the personal boundaries that each individual properly claims as their own. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is forever done with the code of \"we,\" with this creed of evil and destruction. He sees clearly the beneficent consequences that can result -- as they did in the past -- when society recognizes the sacred rights of individuals to mind, soul, values, and life.

He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He had wished to find a warrant for being, but now understands that he needs neither warrant nor sanction.

Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service.

        "Equality 7-2521 realizes the meaning of the word \"I\" and realizes what has been missing from his world. He writes about standing at the summit of a mountain and concludes that he has reached the end of his quest to find the meaning of things because he is the meaning of things. His eyes' seeing makes the earth beautiful, and his ears' hearing makes the earth sing. His mind's searching gives the earth truth. His will is the only command he respects or should respect. In his new view, the only three holy words are \"I will it. Equality 7-2521 realizes that the goal of his existence, no matter what may come of the earth, is his personal happiness. He is not a means to an end, and he is not a servant of his brothers. His miracles are his and his alone, and he will protect them from others at all costs. He says that his treasures are his thoughts, his will, and his freedom, and the greatest of these is freedom. He owes nothing to his brothers. They owe him nothing, and he wants nothing from them. Those of his brothers who earn his honor will have it, but they will not have it just by virtue of being fellow men. He chooses his friends and he chooses when to join with them and when not to. In Equality 7-2521's newfound view, the word \"we\" must always be a second thought to men, after the word \"I. When it is allowed to become a primary thought, it is the root of all evil and becomes a great lie. The word \"we\" enables the weak to steal from the strong and becomes a stone that crushes all those beneath it. Equality 7-2521 vows that he is finished with the old society and collectivism. He has seen the face of god, and he will raise it above the earth so that everyone may worship at its altar. His new god is \"I",
        "Finally Equality 7-2521 discovers the word \"I\" through his reading of the old scripts. \"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.\" \"My happiness is not the means to any end. \"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I cover no man's soul, nor is my soul theirs to cover.\""

        "Ethan has a tiny study on the first floor, done up in humble imitation of the study of a minister who was kind to him in Worcester. Since Mattie came and he moved the stove up to her room, it has been uninhabitable during the winter. But he goes there now, trying to figure out a way to take his life back. He carries with him a tiny note written by Mattie and left for him on the kitchen table: \"Don't trouble, Ethan\". He remembers meeting a couple who had faced a similar situation. The man had divorced his wife and fled west with his new girl, and everyone had prospered. The ex-wife sold the farm and started her own business, and the man and his new wife fared well out west. He begins a farewell letter to Zeena. But as he tries to plan a course of action for himself, he realizes that escape is impossible. Zeena will not be able to sell the farm for any considerable sum, and she has no means to survive in the mean time. And as for him and Mattie, they don't even have enough money to get out West. Ethan falls asleep in the study despite the cold. The next morning, Jotham Powell is there. A coach is going to come later in the day to pick up Mattie's heavy trunk, and Jotham is going to take Mattie to the station when he goes to pick up the new hired girl. Ethan heads toward town, humiliated by his own powerlessness. He suddenly considers a new plan: if he tells Andrew Hale that he needs money to hire a girl to help Zeena, he could use the cash advance to flee west with Mattie. He goes to the Hale mill, running into their sleigh on the weigh. Mrs. Hale is the rider, and she talks to Ethan sympathetically about Zeena's latest health problems. She admires Ethan for taking care of Zeena and before her, his mother. The sleigh takes off, and Ethan keeps on toward the Hales': if they feel sorry for him, they're sure to loan him the money. But then Ethan realizes that he is planning to use the compassion of the Hales' to get money dishonestly. He realizes the truth of his situation: Zeena cannot fend for herself, and Ethan's flight with Mattie would depend on deceiving the Hales. He turns and goes back to his own farm.",
        "Ethan has a little make-shift study that he hadn't used in a while be because the heater that previously heated it was given to Mattie for her room. When Zeena was safely sleeping, Ethan headed to that room. He and Mattie hadn't talked after the scene, but when he'd come in from doing his final chores he found a note left by Mattie before she went to bed. It said, \"Don't trouble, Ethan.\" This was his first note ever from Mattie. The note makes him feel closer to her. Wrestling with his mind, Ethan decides he can have happiness. He doesn't have to live this way. There was this guy who left his wife for a younger woman. By leaving her the farm, the man had made sure the left wife would have something to live on, and moved West. Ethan had met the couple and seen their cute little baby. He decides to write Zeena a letter and then leave with Mattie the next day. As he writes he begins to have doubts. The farm isn't worth anything to sell, and there is no way Zeena could do any of the work on it. She can go live with her relatives and he will eventually pay her alimony. He finds a newspaper so he can look at the cost of a trip West. Crushed, Ethan learns that he can't even afford the cheapest ticket, and nobody would loan him any money. He cries and falls asleep thinking of how he and Mattie were supposed to sled tonight. When he wakes up, he realizes it's Mattie's final day on the farm. Mattie is waiting for him. She'd heard him leave the house last night and had not heard him return. They move to the kitchen. Ethan touches Mattie and says, \"I don't want you should trouble either\" . She agrees not to. Ethan warns her not to let Zeena get to her today. When Jotham comes in he tells Ethan that Zeena asked him to drive Mattie away. Ethan says that he will be the one to drive Mattie. When Zeena comes in she tells Mattie she's arranged for her trunk to be transported. Mattie thanks her. Determined to give it another shot, Ethan decides to use Zeena's illness as an excuse to get Andrew Hale to loan him some money. Mrs. Hale is very sweet to him, and tells him she feels bad that he's had such a hard life. He hadn't experienced that level of kindness in some time. But he can't go through with it. Ethan walks back home.",
        "Directly following her outburst over the broken dish, Zeena retires upstairs to bed, and a shaken Mattie continues to clear up the kitchen. Ethan makes his usual rounds outside the house and returns to find the kitchen empty. His tobacco pouch and pipe have been laid out on the table next to a brief note in Mattie's handwriting telling him not to worry. Retreating into his makeshift study, Ethan contemplates the note over and over again, pondering a way out of his unbearable situation. Flinging aside in disgust a handmade cushion of Zeena's, Ethan mentally reviews the case of a local man who had deserted his wife in favor of the woman he loved. Encouraged by this precedent, Ethan resolves to run away with Mattie, and he prepares to write a letter of farewell to Zeena, leaving her the farm and the mill. But Ethan pauses at the prospect of starting over without any money, and he pictures the grim situation in which Zeena will be left. Slowly, he comes to the bitter recognition of his plan's impracticality, and he crumples back to the sofa in tears, falling asleep beneath the light of a large moon in the beautiful winter night sky. Ethan wakes up cold, stiff, and hungry, and rises in the knowledge that this will be Mattie's last day beneath his roof. As he stands alone in his study, he hears a step behind him and turns around to see Mattie, full of concern for his well-being after having listened all night for his return upstairs. Ethan, overwhelmed by her show of caring, lights the kitchen fire for her, and, as they sit down to a breakfast of leftovers, they decide not to worry about Zeena's threats. Ethan heads out to the cow barn, where he encounters Powell. When Powell presses to secure the details for the new hired girl's arrival and Mattie's departure, Ethan responds by saying that the matter of Mattie's dismissal is itself still unresolved. Powell reacts indifferently to this piece of news. Back in the kitchen, the men enter to find Mattie and Zeena seated at a full breakfast table. Zeena eats heartily, feeds scraps to the cat, and discusses departure and arrival times with Powell. She then endeavors to settle a few final matters with Mattie, as Ethan looks on wordlessly. After finishing his morning tasks, Ethan tells Powell that he is heading into town and that they should not wait for him to have dinner. Frantically searching for a solution, Ethan decides again to ask Andrew Hale for the advance on the lumber, feeling that Hale would relent if he thought that the money would make a difference in Zeena's health. With the money, Ethan decides, he will be able to run away with Mattie and start a new life elsewhere. Aiming to intercept Hale before he departs for work, Ethan runs quickly down the hill, and spots the Hale wagon in the distance. Arriving at its side, he finds not Hale but Hale's wife in the sleigh. She informs him that Hale is resting at home for the morning, and she speaks kindly to him about his fortitude in caring for Zeena before she goes on. Mrs. Hale's compassionate words encourage Ethan in his errand: if the Hales feel so sympathetic toward him, he thinks, surely they will advance him the cash. But after a few paces, Ethan's conscience catches up with his fantasies, and he realizes the extent of the deception in which he is prepared to engage. With his ethics now gaining dominance over his passions, Ethan slowly turns around and heads back to the farm.",
        "After Ethan's father died and Ethan returned to the farm from school, his mother gave him a room at the back of the house to serve as his \"study,\" a place for his desk and books. He has always taken refuge there; now that he has given Mattie the stove from the room, it is uninhabitable for most of the year. After everyone has gone to bed, Ethan goes to his study. Just before he himself goes to bed, he finds a note from Mattie on the kitchen table. It simply says, \"Don't trouble, Ethan;\" but it is the first time she has ever written anything to him. He rereads the note and thinks that such a cold, dead piece of paper represents his future with Mattie. He despises the thought of living out his years with Zeena. He goes to lie down on his couch, and throws away a cushion that Zeena made for him when they were engaged. Even the cushion is hard and uncomfortable. Ethan remembers the story of a man, a young fellow his own age, who ran away from a life of misery by going west with another young woman. The wife divorced him, he prospered, and the couple came back to visit. Ethan springs up and goes to his desk to start a letter to Zeena. He tells her she can sell the farm and keep the money. Here he stops, for he remembers that the farm and mill are mortgaged. Even if there were not, Zeena could never run the place. She would have to go back to her people, the same fate Zeena was forcing on Mattie. In addition, he would have trouble supporting Mattie. He looks at a newspaper sitting nearby with trips to the west advertised. Ethan knows he does not have the money to pay for he and Mattie to go. Ethan returns to the sofa, and tears well up in him. He watches the moon dawn on the landscape and contemplates everything in life in terms of Mattie. He remembers that they were supposed to go coasting tonight; now they will probably never be able to go. As he nurses his misery, the beauty of the landscape mocks him until he falls asleep. Ethan wakes with the realization it will be Mattie's last day with him. She appears in the room and knows he has been there all night. Ethan stirs, and they go together to start the kitchen fire. As the sun comes up and Mattie goes about her work, Ethan feels better. He feels that with the return of daylight, Zeena, too, will see that it is insane to let Mattie go. Ethan and Mattie try to reassure each other, but they are not bolstered. Ethan goes out to the barn to clean stalls with Jotham. Ethan is floored and wonders how Jotham knows about Mattie's leaving. Ethan says he is not sure Mattie is going. The two men go into breakfast. Zeena, alert and active, remarks that the geraniums have been neglected. She then turns to Jotham and asks when Mattie's trunk will be picked up. Jotham glances at Ethan and says \"about noon.\" Zeena says that she would like to go over the contents with Mattie before the trunk is picked up, implying that Mattie has stolen something. The two women leave the kitchen, and Jotham remarks that he guesses he better tell Daniel to come around after all. Ethan feels rebellious and walks into town for no purpose. Everything he sees reminds him of Mattie, and he decides he must do something to prevent her from leaving. He decides to again ask Hale for some cash and proceeds towards his house. He meets Mrs. Hale on the road, and she says that Mr. Hale is home sick. She adds that she has heard of Zeena's recent trip to the new doctor and sympathizes with Ethan about all the trouble he has had in his life. Although he is grateful for her rare understanding of his problems, he is more concerned about gaining Mr. Hale's sympathy in order to obtain money. He decides he has no right to ask the Hales for money to serve his selfish purposes. Ethan walks back to his farm without seeing Hale.",
        "After Zeena retires upstairs, Mattie clears up the kitchen and Ethan makes his usual rounds outside. The kitchen is empty when he gets back, but Mattie has left a note for him, saying, \"Don't trouble, Ethan. \" Ethan feels he cannot give up the \"life\" and \"warmth\" that Mattie gives him. He flings aside a cushion that Zeena had made and reflects on the case of a local man who had escaped from a similar life of misery by going West with the girl he loved. They had a child and prospered, and even the deserted wife had done well. Encouraged by this example, Ethan decides to go West with Mattie, leaving a note for Zeena. He plans to leave her the farm and mill so that she can sell it and live off the money. Then Ethan begins to reflect. He was sure of finding work and could manage if he were alone, but with Mattie depending on him, the case was different. And the farm and mill were mortgaged to the hilt; Zeena would only clear a thousand dollars on the sale. She could return to her family, the fate she was forcing on Mattie. But then he notices an advertisement in the paper offering trips West, and realizes he cannot even afford the reduced rate. He is \"a prisoner for life,\" he decides, and will lose his \"one ray of light,\" Mattie. He collapses on the sofa in tears. Then he notices that the moon is up, and remembers his promise to take Mattie sledding that evening. He falls asleep. Ethan wakes cold, stiff and hungry, and recalls that it is Mattie's last day. Mattie comes in, aware that he has not been to bed, since she was listening all night for him to come upstairs. He is touched by her concern and makes up the fire for her. He comforts himself that Zeena may relent and allow Mattie to stay. When he goes out to the cow-barn he meets Jotham, who tells Ethan of the arrangements that Zeena has already made with him to take Mattie and her trunk to the station. Ethan replies that the question of Mattie's leaving is not settled. The two men go into the house to join the women for breakfast. Zeena is unusually alert and is feeding the cat. She asks Jotham about the travel arrangements for Mattie. Then she says that there are some things she wants to clear up with Mattie before she leaves - namely, she believes that certain household items are missing. She and Mattie leave the room, and Jotham tells Ethan that he will go ahead with the travel arrangements. Ethan views these proceedings without a word. After Ethan finishes his morning tasks, he becomes fired with rebellion once more. He feels appalled that he has assisted \"as a helpless spectator at Mattie's banishment.\" The sun has come out and a \"pale haze\" of spring can be seen. Mattie's presence seems to infuse the entire scene. He will ask Andrew Hale once more to advance him a payment on the wood, using the excuse that Zeena's ill health makes it necessary to hire a servant. Catching sight of Hale's sleigh, he hurries to meet it, but sees it is Mrs Hale in the sleigh. Mrs Hale tells him that she has heard about Zeena's going to see the new doctor. She expresses regret that Zeena is not feeling well and says that she does not know what she would have done if Ethan had not been around to take care of her. She commiserates with Ethan: \"You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome.\" . Ethan is moved by Mrs Hale's kindness and at first is strengthened in his purpose, thinking that the Hales may look sympathetically on his request for payment. He begins to walk to their house to see Mr Hale, but draws up short at the realization that he is about to take advantage of their sympathy to obtain money on false pretences. He cannot find the heart to leave Zeena alone and destitute, particularly if it means deceiving two kind people."

        "Jurgis, now awakened by Socialism, returns to Elzbieta's house where he attempts to convince her of the system's merits. She is skeptical, but decides that anything that keeps Jurgis away from drink and makes him industrious is worth it. Jurgis begins looking for a job and fortunately comes to find one in a hotel as a porter. When Ostrinski learns of Jurgis's job, he tells him that the hotel owner is one of the most passionate Socialist Party members in the city. The hotel, owned by a man name Hinds, is a hotbed of Socialist activity. Hinds tells Jurgis of his own life and struggles and anytime he is faced with adversity he mutters: \"'Capitalism, my boy, Capitalism. Ecrasez l'Infame. The hotel employs a number of Socialist Party members and every night the employees get into intense arguments and debates with guests who defend systems of capitalism and individualism. Hinds explains how the Oil Trust, the Beef Trust, and the Railroad Trust actually own the country and the politicians. Some guests change their minds and attitudes towards socialism, and some do not. Jurgis begins to spend all his time and much of his money on spreading the Socialist cause, though he does occasionally fall into old habits of drink. At those times, he remembers, however, that it is a \"wicked thing to spend one's pennies for a drink, when the working-class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered. Jurgis attempts to convert his neighbors to socialism, though he makes many enemies and almost gets into a few fights during the process. The people tell Jurgis that socialism is \"paternalism,\" but Jurgis argues that by letting the capitalists rule the country and build the libraries and social structures, they are not allowing the workers to build their own country. Jurgis meets and hears a number of famous socialist speakers and writers. He meets the \"Little Giant,\" a little person who \"had written a veritable encyclopedia\" of Socialism. He hears a young author from California that had made a fortune selling books but that had never ceased to fight for the poor. He begins to read the \"Appeal to Reason,\" a tabloid newspaper that spreads the word of socialism through fantastical stories. Jurgis and the Socialist Party members distribute flyers and pamphlets telling the people of Packingtown what they can do to fight the Beef Trust when their strike fails. Feeling pressure, Mike Scully brings in the South Carolina \"pitchfork Senator\" to speak to the workers and to fight for the Republican Party. Jurgis stands up, however, and gives his own speech in the meeting, telling the crowd how he himself had been a part of the political machine that had bought votes and oppressed the voice of the people",
        "The next morning, Jurgis goes to find Teta Elzbieta. He starts talking to her about socialism. Teta Elzbieta couldn't care less about whether or not socialism is right for the world. All she cares about is that Jurgis's new convictions mean that he plans to stay sober and look for a job. Once she figures that out, she encourages Jurgis's socialism as much as he wants. Jurgis starts looking for jobs at the various hotels in the neighborhood. A week later, Jurgis goes into the lobby of a hotel and approaches the owner. The owner asks Jurgis if he drinks. Jurgis says no, and the owner asks Jurgis if he is afraid of hard work. Jurgis says that's fine. Jurgis tells Ostrinski he's gotten a job at a nearby hotel. Ostrinski is thrilled to hear that Jurgis has been hired at Hind's Hotel. Apparently, Tommy Hinds, the owner of this place, is a state organizer of the Socialist Party in Illinois. The next day, Jurgis informs his employer that he is also a socialist. Tommy Hinds shakes his hand. Tommy Hinds calls Jurgis \"Comrade Jurgis,\" and Jurgis calls his boss \"Comrade Hinds.\" Tommy Hinds frequently goes out to convince people to vote the socialist ticket to solve their troubles. He has a history as a union organizer and populist. After the 1896 election, in which Populist and Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan lost his campaign for president, Tommy Hinds gave up on the idea of wealth in private hands. Ever since then, he has been getting himself invited to every business meeting and church service in Chicago so that he can preach the value of socialism far and wide. Tommy Hinds's hotel is also a big source of pro-socialist political activity. His staff members are all socialists, and his chief clerk has been fighting the big railroad companies his whole life. His assistant clerk is Harry Adams, a smart guy from Massachusetts who moved down south to South Carolina and was horrified by the widespread illiteracy and poverty he found there. So he moved to Chicago and became a socialist. Oddly, the fact that this hotel is a socialist business doesn't mean it's not profitable. The hotel is inexpensive and gets plenty of out-of-towners looking for work in the stockyards who are too poor to afford lodging elsewhere. Tommy Hinds works to convert all of these new guys to the cause. He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards. Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him to get personal - he just wants Jurgis to explain the bad business and hygiene practices at these meatpacking plants. Jurgis learns everything he needs to know about socialism working for Tommy Hinds. Because he has such faith in Tommy Hinds's views, Jurgis works harder and with more loyalty than he ever would have for the meatpackers. Jurgis does his best to convert his acquaintances to socialism. Even though the benefits of socialism seem obvious to Jurgis, a lot of working people resist. They claim to prefer individualism, and resist the kind of control on their money that socialism would mean. Jurgis feels that these people are forgetting that the people who really benefit from individualism and capitalism are the steel, oil, and meat magnates. Jurgis starts to read newspapers and to learn about America's history so that he can convince people to join the socialist cause. At socialist meetings, Jurgis meets a range of extraordinary organizers and great people who have sacrificed so much to join the cause of the working man. Jurgis becomes a regular reader of Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper with lots of tidbits about how the American working man suffers. They begin to distribute this newspaper in Packingtown after the union lost the strike there, so that workers can take hope. Jurgis also hands out Appeal to Reason in the stockyards in an effort to undo the damage he did when he was part of Mike Scully's political machine.

Strether can tell from the shock in Madame de Vionnet's eyes that he has caught these two doing something that doesn't quite fit into his moral code. And so at this moment, all of reality seems to come crashing down on Strether. He realizes that Chad and Madame have left Paris so they can find a nice quiet inn outside the city and, ahem, engage in a sexual relationship. Of course, Strether tries to act cool about it once he sees that Madame de Vionnet has recognized him. He waves from the shore and invites them to dinner. You know, because to walk away would be awkward. Once Chad and Madame get to shore, all of them are like, \"Wow, what a coincidence! While they're all thinking, \"God, Strether totally knows about what's been going on this whole time.\" This is followed by a super awkward dinner, where Chad and Madame can only think about how ol' third-wheel Strether is blowing their chance at sex. While Strether is thinking that his whole life has been a lie since getting to Paris. Instead, he's the one gullible loser in Paris who was too naive to see what was happening right in front of his eyes.

Worse yet, Chad and Madame's sexual relationship means that on some level, Sarah Pocock was right all along. Strether was just too blind to see it. Or worse still, he's actually known all along, but has been lying to himself.",

So this time when he visits Chad's apartment, Chad's actually there.

        "The Archers begin setting up for their first dinner party, \"a big event\" for a young couple. The party will be in honor of Ellen Olenska leaving New York and returning to Europe. Although Ellen had not spoken to Newland in ten days, he returned a key that he had given her earlier in a blank envelope. Newland is assigned the job of evaluating Ellen1s trust. All the while that he is taking care of her finances, he think that there will be an affair between the two in the future. His belief in the future keeps him from writing her. The night of the dinner party Ellen looks pale, \"lusterless and almost ugly. But still, Newland had never loved her face as much as he did at that moment. Newland notices that Ellen1s hand is ungloved. Newland thinks, \"If it were only to see her hand again I should have to follow her \" Normally only \"foreign visitors\" would be important enough to sit at the hosts left and take the place of Mrs. van der Luyden. But, they make an exception and let Ellen sit to the host1s left because, \"There were certain things that had to be done, and If done at all, done handsomely and thoroughly; and one of these in the old New York code, was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe. Newland realizes that everyone thinks that a true \"affair\" had been going on between Newland and Ellen; the celebration is really because the \"separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved. It was the New York way to take a life without any traces of blood. Newland looks at Ellen; he imagines she is thinking, \"Let1s see it through,\" which means, let1s have our affair as planned. All the men retire to the library after dinner, and discuss how their society is changing. Larry Lefferts says, \"If things go on at this pace we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers1 houses and marrying Beaufort1s bastards. Later that evening, May asks if it is alright if they have a talk. Newland tries to tell her that he is tired of life and wants to go on a long trip; May says, that he can1t go because she found out today that she is pregnant. Newland has a \"sick stare\" and asks who she has told. She says that she1s told Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Welland and. Ellen. She had told Ellen about it two weeks ago. Newland asks her why she would tell Ellen about her pregnancy if she was not sure about it until today. She says, \"I wasn1t sure then, but I told her I was.",
        "About ten days after Ellen's departure for Washington, DC, May decides to hold a farewell dinner for Ellen. A day after Ellen had departed, Mr. Letterblair had discussed with Archer some arrangements Mrs. Manson Mingott had made to set up a trust for Ellen with sufficient funds so that she could live independently in Paris. Ellen will live with Marchioness Manson. On the evening of the dinner party, everyone arrives, including the van der Luydens, the Lefferts, the Selfridge Merrys, etc. Finally, Madame Olenska arrives but she and Archer don't have much of a chance to talk alone. Archer has a few polite words with Madame Olenska at dinner, and then he asks Reggie Chivers very loudly whether Chivers would like to travel the world with him.

        "Newland and his wife and mother go to the Opera. Mrs. van der Luyden comments that she saw Catherine1s carriage parked outside of the Beaufort1s home. May quickly lies for Catherine saying that she is certain that the carriage was there without Catherine knowing. The van der Luydens realize that Ellen had taken the carriage to the Beauforts. Mrs. Archer tries to make excuses: \"Imprudent people are often kind. Newland watches the Opera with some disgust thinking, \"the same large blonde victim is succumbing to the same small brown seducer. May is wearing her wedding dress for the first time in two years. Wharton explains that \"it was the custom, in old New York, for brides to appear in this costly garment during the first year or two of marriage. Newland decides that he absolutely must leave and whispers to May that he has a beastly headache and wants to go home. Stepping out of the carriage, May tears her wedding dress. Newland asks if she1d like some brandy \"because she looks very pale\" but May blushes and says no. Newland tries to talk to May about Ellen; but May cleverly guides the conversation to explain that Ellen will be returning to Europe soon. Newland is obviously shaken by the news and May leaves the room quietly saying \"my head aches too.",
        "Archer spends all the next day at the office, so he doesn't see May until they leave for a dinner given by the van der Luydens. After discussing the Beauforts's ruin and Ellen's questionable visit to Regina Beaufort, the dinner party goes off to see Faust at the opera. At the opera house, Archer notices that his wife is wearing her bridal satin, which many brides wear for the first year or two of marriage in New York. Archer goes to his wife's box and tells her that he has a headache and would like to return home. When they return home, his wife tears her dress on the carriage step as she is stepping out. Once inside, Archer begins to confess to his wife about his feelings for Madame Olenska, but he only gets as far as saying Madame Olenska's name when May announces that Madame Olenska has already left town, that she's gone to Washington, D.C., to pack up and move to Paris, with Mrs. Manson Mingott's approval. Archer is astonished. May shows Archer a letter Ellen wrote to her, and Archer breaks out laughing. May announces that she has a headache too and goes to bed.",
        "Archer is stunned upon leaving Mrs. Mingott's. He reasons that Ellen's decision to stay in New York must be an indication that she has resolved to have an affair with him. While Archer is somewhat relieved that she will be staying, he is also afraid that their affair will be no different than those of his peers and that it will dissolve into a pathetic pack of lies. Yet he consoles himself with the thought that he and Ellen are different from the rest of New York society and that their unique situation puts them above the judgment of their clan. That evening, he waits in front of Beaufort's house for Ellen, who we learn has come to console Regina Beaufort in the midst of her troubles. They agree to meet the next day at the Metropolitan Museum. The following day, Archer meets Ellen in the antiquities gallery of the museum. Ellen explains that she has decided to stay near her grandmother because she feels she will be safe there from the temptation of Archer. She begs him not to let them become like the other adulterers they know. Yet she hesitates and asks him if she should just come to him once and then leave New York. Archer agrees, and they plan to meet two days later. Back home that evening, Archer learns from May that she too has seen Ellen that afternoon. May claims that the two of them have had a long talk and that May has decided to befriend Ellen despite her eccentricities. The next night, the van der Luydens host a pre-opera dinner at their exclusive Madison Avenue home. At dinner, the topic of discussion is again the Beauforts' financial failure. The van der Luydens are dismayed to learn that Ellen had been to see Mrs. Beaufort, an action they conceive of as imprudent, considering the Beauforts' fall from good society. At the opera, Archer feels guilty about his intended tryst with Ellen. At his side, May is wearing her wedding dress, as is the custom for young married women. Archer suddenly feels the urge to confess to her, and he persuades May to leave the opera early. Back home, Archer is on the verge of confessing when May interrupts him by mentioning that Ellen has decided to return to Europe. Archer is stunned and excuses himself for bed."

This is day one of year one of the new epoch--the Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am Invisible Man the First\" . The letter also says that Griffin will kill Kemp that day. What's even better is that Griffin sent that letter without a stamp, so Kemp had to pay for it upon delivery. Kemp has his housekeeper lock up all the windows and gets his revolver ready. He writes a note for Adye, saying that Kemp will act as bait to catch Griffin. Adye shows up later, saying that Griffin grabbed the note from Kemp's servant. So now Griffin knows that Kemp wants to set a trap. Bummer. Then Griffin does what he does best: he breaks some windows. But there's no way for him to get into Kemp's house because they've anticipated his arrival. This is the siege of Kemp's house. Adye borrows Kemp's gun and tries to go for help, but Griffin trips him up and grabs the gun. At first, Adye refuses to help Griffin, but he changes his mind when he realizes \"that life was very sweet\" . The narrator switches point-of-view here, and goes from Adye to Kemp, who is watching all this from an upstairs window. Suddenly, he sees Adye attack Griffin and get shot. It sure looks like Adye is dead, but we're not sure. Kemp's housemaid is coming up the hill with two policemen. At the same time, Griffin has found an axe and is using it to break through the shutters over a window. Luckily for Kemp, the police get there in time, and he gives them some fireplace pokers to use as clubs. So it's pokers vs. axe-and-revolver, though Griffin isn't a great shot. Griffin knocks out one of the cops, but the other cop hurts Griffin . There's a snapping sound, so maybe his arm gets broken. Griffin drops his weapons and runs away. But when the cops look around, they find that Kemp and his housemaid have also run away. That probably doesn't make them feel too great about the guy they just saved."

        "Flaminius, one of Timon's servants, arrives at Lucullus's house to ask for a loan, carrying a box under his arm. Lucullus is glad to see him, convinced he carries some gift from Timon. He asks what is in the box, but Flaminius says it's an empty box. He has come on Timon's behalf to ask that it be filled with cash for a loan, which Timon is sure his friend will provide. Lucullus notes that he has always enjoyed Timon's hospitality, but he has often warned him that his holdings would run out, though Timon never listened. Lucullus compliments Flaminius, saying he always thought he was a good man. But now is not the time to make a loan, he says, based merely on friendship without security. He gives Flaminius several coins as a bribe to tell Timon that he didn't speak to Lucullus, but Flaminius hurls them back at him. Lucullus departs. Flaminius ponders the nature of friendship, that it should be so weak as to change overnight. Lucullus was fed at Timon's table, yet now he won't pay him back. Flaminius wishes him ill, and departs. Lucius, another of Timon's friends, enters, talking to several strangers. The strangers have heard rumors that Timon's finances are in bad shape, but Lucius finds it hard to believe. They have also heard that Timon asked Lucullus for money, and Lucullus refused him. Lucius admits that he has received gifts from Timon too, though less than Lucullus--but he would have never denied Timon a loan if he had asked. Servilius, Timon's servant, enters. Lucius too thinks Timon's servant has come to bring him a gift, but Servilius explains his mission is to ask for a loan. Lucius says it's bad luck, but he has just spent all his money on a small investment, and now has no ready cash. He sends his best wishes to Timon, but cannot send him any money. Servilius and Lucius depart, leaving the strangers to discourse on the nature of friendship. They say that Timon has been like a father to Lucius financially, yet Lucius denies Timon a loan of even a small percentage of what Lucius has given him. Though they have never met Timon, the strangers agree that what they have heard of him suggests he is a man they would be glad to help out through a loan. But they see Timon's friends are unable to have pity for Timon, but calculatingly plan ways to retain their wealth. Timon's third servant enters with Sempronius, another of Timon's friends. Sempronius is annoyed that Timon asks him for a loan, and suggests he had better ask Lucullus or Lucius or even Ventidius. The servant explains that all have already been asked and would give no money. Sempronius is even more annoyed when he hears that he has been asked after the other three; he wonders if he is Timon's last refuge. He feels disgraced to be so low on the totem pole, when he prided himself on being the first man to receive a gift from Timon. Finding himself so slighted as to be asked for a loan after other men, Sempronius refuses, and leaves. The servant calls Sempronius a villain. Now Timon's friends have all betrayed and abandoned him.",
        "Timon comes out of his cave and considers the sun and the earth. He hopes the sun breeds plagues, and that all of like nature will come to hate each other. He rages about flatterers, says all things of men are devious and villainous, that he abhors all society of mankind, and he hopes it comes to destruction. Astonished to have found gold when he now needs it least, Timon speaks of the awful power of wealth, how gold, \"this yellow slave\" , makes or breaks religion, makes thieves into senators, and convinces aged widows to wed again. He orders the earth to behave normally, to hide the gold and reveal roots, and reburies the gold, while keeping some of it. Then Alcibiades enters, with one prostitute on each arm. He doesn't recognize Timon at first, and asks him who he is. Timon introduces himself as Misanthropos, a hater of mankind. Alcibiades recognizes him, and asks him how he changed so much. Alcibiades offers his friendship, but Timon turns it down, saying that no man can promise friendship and genuinely perform it. Alcibiades says he would like to help Timon, but he has little gold to offer him, yet gives him a small amount. Timon turns it down, and Alcibiades promises to help him when he has sacked Athens. Timon perks up at the mention of an assault on Athens. He gives Alcibiades gold to support his campaign, urging him to kill everyone, even old men, virgins, children, women or priests. Alcibiades takes the gold, but hesitates at taking his advice. The prostitutes ask for gold too, and he gives it to them, urging them to continue in their profession, spreading illness among all their patrons. He urges them to give diseases to the men of Athens, to bring all men to squalid deaths. Alcibiades and the prostitutes prepare to depart for Athens, and Timon says he hopes he never sees Alcibiades again. Alcibiades is surprised, saying he never harmed Timon. Yet Timon shoos him away. Timon continues digging in the ground for edible roots, speaking with disgust of mankind. Then Apemantus enters. Timon curses him, but Apemantus absorbs his slights, noting that his recent change in fortune has made Timon unlike himself, while his former flatterers still live in silk-lined comfort, forgetting Timon ever existed. Apemantus says it's only fair that Timon has sunk to this, for his wealth was frittered away in generosity to unworthy people, all villainous rascals. Apemantus dares Timon to try to get the creatures of nature to flatter him now. Timon tells him to leave, but Apemantus says he loves Timon more now than ever before. Timon accuses him of flattering his misery. Timon asks why Apemantus has come. Apemantus replies that he intends only to vex Timon. Apemantus says Timon has become a beggar by his own compulsion, and would gladly be a rich man again if he could. Timon has willed himself into misery, says Apemantus. Timon insists Apemantus's experiences have been different, since he was never in fortune's favor. If Apemantus had lived Timon's life, he would have wasted himself away without reaching respectability. But Timon was like an oak whose leaves blew off in one blast of wintry air, and now must nakedly bear misfortune. It's harder for him, he says, since he never experienced it before, but Apemantus is used to suffering. Why does Apemantus hate mankind, Timon asks, when men have never flattered him? If Apemantus curses anyone, it should be his father, who left him to be raised by a beggar woman. Timon urges him to leave, saying if he had not been born the most miserable of men, he would have been a hateful flatterer. Apemantus asks him if he is done ranting, and offers him food. Timon tells Apemantus to go back to Athens. Timon continues cursing Apemantus, who observes that Timon has to be an extremist: \"the middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends\" . Timon asks Apemantus if anyone ever loved him; Apemantus replies that only he himself has. Timon asks what Apemantus would do with the world, if he had the power. Apemantus says he would give it to the beasts, but Timon says that wouldn't help him, since there would be no beast that he could be that would not be subject to another beast. Apemantus says Timon has hit on something, as Athens has already become a forest of beasts. Timon and Apemantus insult each other, and Timon throws a rock at Apemantus to try to get him to leave. Timon considers his epitaph, for his hopefully imminent death. He looks on his gold, remarks on its power to influence the actions of men, and hopes it will reduce mankind do the behavior of low beasts. Apemantus sees bandits approaching, and takes leave of Timon. The thieves speak among themselves, wondering how to get the gold from Timon. They approach Timon, saying they are soldiers. But Timon suspects they are thieves, and gives them gold, urging them on to do villainy to men, to steal money and take lives. Discoursing in thievery, Timon says the sun is a thief who robs the sea, the moon thieves from the sun, the sea steals its tides from the moon, and the earth is a thief, stealing its fertility from excrement. Everything is a thief, therefore, and everyone also. Timon sends the bandits to Athens, tells them to break into shops and steal as much as he has given them. The thieves are impressed by his speech, so much so that Timon nearly convinces them to leave their profession than to go on stealing. They realize Timon advises them thus out of hatred for mankind, not out of enthusiasm for thievery. But they decide to head to Athens before giving up their trade, and exit. Flavius arrives, speaking sadly about his fallen master. How vile is friendship, he says, that it has made Timon fall so far. When Timon sees him, he asks if he recognizes him. Timon says he has forgotten all men, so Flavius says he was once Timon's poor honest servant. Yet Timon says he had no honest men about him. Flavius insists his grief is honest, and Timon sees he weeps. Timon softens to Flavius, since his weeping demonstrates a sense of pity. Flavius offers his money to Timon. Timon is astonished, and thinks that the kindness of his servant is nearly enough to make him change his mind about abandoning mankind. He admits that there is one honest man among the villains of the world, and he is but a servant. Timon would have hated all mankind, but one man escapes his curses. He says Flavius is more honest than he is wise, for by betraying Timon he could have found a much better job. And then he asks Flavius if his kindness is a plot, \"A usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts, / expecting in return twenty for one?\" . Flavius insists that what he offers is real kindness and love, and he offers to take care of Timon's comfort in the wilderness. He says his only wish is to become rich so that he might make Timon rich again. Timon gives Flavius money on the condition that he lives apart from mankind, that he never gives anything to even the skinniest beggar. Flavius begs to stay, but Timon sends him away.",
        "Another servant of Timon visits Lord Sempronius and tells him that his master has asked for his help. Sempronius like the others has no intention of helping Timon. He therefore comes up with a fantastic excuse. He pretends to be displeased for the fact that Lucius, Lucullus, and Ventidius have been approached before him. He sees no logical reason why Timon did not seek his help first. He doesnt want to be considered as a fool by other lords and therefore sends him back empty handed. While returning back to Timons house, the servant muses that now that all his friends have betrayed Timon, all that he can do is trust the Gods to come to his assistance. He also realizes that Timon now has to remain indoors all the time so that he is not arrested for not paying his debts.",
        "Timon dwells in a cave in the forest and decides that he will never go back to the society. His still continues to curse mankind. He suddenly hears the beats of drums and hides it. Alcibiades enters along with his two mistresses, Phrynia and Timandra. Alcibiades at first does not recognize Timon. Later when he recognizes Timon, he is shocked to see Timons state and confesses that he was unaware of Timons misfortune. Timon, who is bitter about his experience with his friends gives Alcibiades the option that he too can betray him. Alcibiades is sympathetic towards his dear friend and offers him some gold. Timon refuses for he has lost interest in it. Timon instructs the prostitutes to spread disease among men, to which Timandra gets angry, but Alcibiades understands Timons state of mind. Timon is happy to hear that Alcibiades is marching against Athens. He gives back the gold Alcibiades offers him and also gives him some gold and tells him to not even spare the virgins the babes or the priest. Alcibiades gets fed up listening to Timon. The mistresses beg Timon to give them gold. He heaps it on their apron and instructs them to continue with their profession. Alcibiades before leaving informs Timon that he would visit him again if he lived. He is upset to see Timon behaving in an affected way. Timon does not entertain him. In fact, Timon is quite rude to Apemantus. Apemantus comments on Timons melancholy, which he feels Timon is overacting. It is a result of change of fortune. He advises Timon to become a flatterer and woo the Senators back. Timon commands him to leave. Apemantus inquires if Timon has anything for Athens to which Timon replies that he now has gold, which is more valuable than anything else for the materialistic citizens of Athens. Apemantus keeps irritating Timon and Timon finally he drives him away by throwing stones at him. The scene now shifts to another part of the forest, where some bandits are discussing how Timon has suddenly acquired gold and how to get it under their possession. They attack him and later on reveal how they were once soldiers and how circumstances have forced them to become bandits. Timon gives them gold and commands them to rob and kill. He gives examples from the nature and how nature herself is a robber. Flavius comes looking for Timon. He feels pity for his master and decides to serve him all his life. At first, Timon refuses to recognize the steward. But when the steward is ready to share his wealth, Timon is relieved to see a true human being and declares that Flavius is the only honest man in the world. Even then he asks Flavius whether there is a hidden motive behind his being kind to him. Flavius muses that if his master had this suspicious nature earlier, then he would have understood the true nature of his friends. Flavius wishes that his master would get rich and powerful once again. Timon gives him some of his gold and advises him to leave him alone and tells him to stay away from all mankind and never give any charity.",
        "A soldier looks for Timon in the woods. He however does not find Timon. His eyes fall on an inscription, which Timon has left behind. The soldier also sees the grave and is sure Timon is dead. Something is written on the tomb, which he cannot read. He decides to take the impression with wax and shows it to Alcibiades the captain who is an experienced interpreter."

        "The scene opens with the conversation between the Senator and Alcibiades. The Senators are discussing what punishment should be given for the crime. The Senators feel he should be sentenced to death, for nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy, and he who kills his own blood cannot be spared. The Senators disagree with Alcibiades saying that he is trying to make a crime look noble. They not only feel that the Alcibiades friend should be punished for his crime but that Alcibiades should be sent on a exile for supporting a wrong cause. When left alone Alcibiades curses Athens and the Senators. Alcibiades decides to take revenge on the Senators."

        "It's July. Miss Prism is sitting at the table while Cecily is in the back, watering the flowers. Miss Prism calls to Cecily to stop doing such a mundane task as watering the flowers because she needs to do her German grammar lesson. Cecily argues that she doesn't want to because she knows she looks plain after her German lesson. Miss Prism retorts that Uncle Jack is only looking out for Cecily's education. Cecily complains that Uncle Jack is so serious. She adds that he's even helping out that unfortunately troublesome younger brother of his. This piques Cecily's interest and she wishes aloud that Uncle Jack would bring Ernest by sometime so that Miss Prism could reform him. Miss Prism tells Cecily to work on her lesson. But the perfect excuse to ignore the lesson is just arriving--Dr. Chasuble. At the sight of him, Miss Prism blushes and stands. They're so obviously crushing on each other that Cecily finds it easy to persuade them to take a walk together. While they're out, Merriman the butler tells Cecily that a Mr. Ernest Worthing has just arrived. Cecily is overjoyed to finally be able to meet the infamous Ernest, but she's scared at the same time. Algernon enters, disguised as Ernest. He greets his \"cousin,\" Cici. They talk about how \"wicked\" he is, with Cecily making comments about how he should reform himself. Charmingly, Algernon/Ernest asks Cecily to try to reform him that very afternoon. As they're flirting and Ernest is finding every way possible to compliment Cecily, like asking for a pink rose for his button-hole \"because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily\" . Algernon learns that Jack plans to send Ernest to Australia. As Cecily's putting a flower into his buttonhole, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return, discussing the moral advantages and disadvantages of marriage. They're so wrapped up in each other that they don't realize that Cecily is not where they left her. Before they can send out a search party, Jack arrives home, dressed in a black suit of mourning. When they ask him about it, Jack announces that he's returned early because his brother Ernest is dead. When Dr. Chasuble offers to perform a funeral ceremony for Ernest, Jack suddenly remembers something. He asks Dr. Chasuble if he can be christened. After some questions, Dr. Chasuble relents and they arrange for Jack to come by at half-past five that evening. Cecily comes from the house to meet her Uncle Jack with the happy news that his brother Ernest arrived just recently and is now in the dining-room. Jack is completely confused. Dr. Chasuble--trying to smooth over the awkward situation--says that these are good tidings indeed . The mystery is solved when Jack sees Algernon sitting at the table. Jack refuses to shake hands with Algernon. We learn from Cecily that Ernest has been telling her about his poor friend, Mr. Bunbury. Finally, Cecily declares she will never speak to Uncle Jack again if he doesn't shake hands with Ernest. Jack gives in reluctantly and Miss Prism praises Cecily for her wonderful act of kindness today. They leave Jack and Ernest together. Furiously, Jack tells Algy to leave at once. But he's interrupted when Merriman comes in to reveal that Mr. Ernest's luggage has been put in the bedroom next to Jack's. Jack tells Merriman that unfortunately Ernest's dog-cart has arrived to take him away; he's been called back to town. While Jack rants at Algernon, Algernon talks about how pretty Cecily is. Jack declares the dog-cart is here and leaves, just in time to miss Algy's comment that he has fallen in love with Cecily. Cecily appears with a watering can in her hand. She and Ernest/Algernon exchange glances. She pleads with Merriman to let Ernest stay for another five minutes. Algernon informs her that Jack is sending him away and compliments her beauty. Flattered, Cecily begins copying his words down in her diary, but refuses to let him look at it. When the dog-cart comes again, Ernest tells it to come again next week. Without ceremony, he asks Cecily to marry him. She responds amusedly that they've been engaged for months. She confides her past fantasies to him, as they're written in her diary. Apparently, Ernest proposed on Valentine's day but they'd broken it off a month later. Now they're back together, which she can prove with the many love letters from him that she has saved . Ernest kisses her for being so forgiving. Then she confides that it's always been a \"girlish dream of mine to love someone whose name was Ernest\" . Distraught, he asks her if she could love him under any other name... say... Algernon, for instance. Cecily finds it a rather aristocratic name, but no, she wouldn't be able to love him then. At that declaration, Ernest/Algernon promptly begins asking her about the rector and whether or not he performs christenings. Algernon leaves to find Dr. Chasuble about a very important matter. As he leaves, Cecily comments that she likes his hair so much. Soon, Merriman enters to tell Cecily that a Miss Fairfax has arrived to see Mr. Worthing. Cecily invites Miss Fairfax to sit with her until Uncle Jack comes out. They're both such charming girls that when they meet, they declare they'll be best friends and call each other immediately by their first names. They talk for a little while before Gwendolen works up the balls to ask Cecily if she can inspect her. Gwendolen, peering through her glasses, finds Cecily rather too attractive and loudly wishes that she were a bit older and more decidedly more dowdy. She asks about Cici's relations and finds out that Mr. Worthing is Cecily's guardian. Now that's problematic, Gwendolen says, since Ernest never mentioned it to her. When Cecily hears the name Ernest, she quickly explains the situation. It's not Ernest Worthing who is my guardian, she says sweetly, but his older brother, Jack. That's a relief to Gwendolen, who suddenly becomes polite again. Cecily proudly declares that she's going to be Ernest Worthing's wife. Gwendolen rises to her feet. Excuse me? Ernest proposed to me yesterday. Cecily retorts that he must've changed his mind because he just proposed to her ten minutes ago. The two women eye each other coldly before Gwendolen announces--alluding to Cecily's rude manners--that they obviously move in different social circles. Right before they can start clawing at each other, Merriman comes by to arrange their tea things. The girls bite back their acidic words in his presence. As Merriman serves them, they glare at each other but chitchat in cordial tones. When Cecily serves Gwendolen tea, she serves it in the opposite manner that Gwendolen requests--giving her lots of sugar in her tea and cake instead of bread and butter. Thank goodness, Jack arrives just in time to break up their fight. When Gwendolen jumps on him and asks if he's to be married to Cecily, Jack laughs it off and kisses Gwendolen. The truth comes out. Cecily replies that he's not Ernest Worthing; that's Uncle Jack. At the unglamorous name, Gwendolen recoils in disgust.

This time it's Gwendolen's turn to clear up the confusion. She reveals that he's not Ernest Worthing; it's Algernon Moncrieff, her cousin. Cecily backs away when she hears \"Algernon.\" The two women embrace each other in distress, while the men hang their heads in shame. They finally ask Jack who Ernest is and he is forced to admit that Ernest doesn't exist.

Westervelt is scornful of Zenobia's decision to kill herself, but Coverdale says that it seems as if Zenobia had reason to in her mind, as she had lost everything -prosperity and love.

        "Adams approaches the entire span of mankind's history on earth from the point of view of \"progress\" and \"forces,\" for which he has specific definitions. His theory \"defines Progress as the development and economy of forces.\" \"Force\" can be anything that produces work; but he also speaks, perhaps more importantly, of the \"attractive force\" of opposing bodies, the gravitational pull of an entity. He applies his theory to what he considers to be the major divisions of history. The first runs from the dawn of time to 3000 B.C. . Second is the period from 3000 B.C. to 1000 A.D., concerned primarily with economies of energy rather than their development, according to Adams. The era from 1000 to 1800 features declining energy of the Church and increasing interest in science. In the nineteenth century, scientific discovery begins to grow.

She replies, \"Nothing certainer\". At the wedding Benedick calls for Beatrice to reveal herself. She does, and he asks her if she loves him. Watching this extraordinary exchange, Claudio and Hero pull out sonnets that Benedick and Beatrice wrote to each other and show them as proof that they really do love each other. Benedick and Claudio reconcile their friendship and tell Don Pedro to find himself a wife so he is not alone.

Benedick tells them, \"Think not on him till tomorrow, I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.",
        "It's the morning of the wedding, and the scene is set in Hero's bedroom. Hero has sent Ursula off to go get Beatrice, and Margaret is helping Hero get dressed. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Beatrice enters and, as usual, becomes the focus of attention. When she sighs, Margaret asks her if she's sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. In response to Beatrice's tizzy, Margaret says she didn't mean anything special by using the name carduus benedictus. Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.",
        "At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Everyone's glad that Hero is innocent. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Claudio takes the mystery girl's hand and swears that he's her husband, if she'll have him. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Prince Don Pedro then declares this is the former Hero, the one that's dead. Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Benedick publicly asks Beatrice if she loves him, and she denies it --kind of. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.",
        "Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Margaret is critical of what Hero has chosen to wear but quickly backs off when Hero scolds her lightly. Margaret also teases Hero about Claudio and his soon-to-be presence in her bed. Ursula returns to tell them that the men have come to take Hero to the church.",
        "The play's final scene begins with the friar's reminder to everyone -- Leonato, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, and Benedick -- that he never doubted Hero's innocence. Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio. As soon as Claudio vows publicly to marry this stranger, Hero reveals her identity to the amazement of Claudio and Don Pedro. Meanwhile, Benedick asks which of the veiled ladies is Beatrice and asks if she loves him. Their usual denials and quick repartee continue until Claudio and Hero each produces love poems Beatrice and Benedick have written to one another. Finally, they happily accept each other. At Benedick's suggestion, dancing begins even before the marriage ceremony. A messenger interrupts the festivities with the news that Don John has been taken prisoner and is being brought back to Messina. Benedick suggests that they think about Don John tomorrow, when Benedick will invent appropriate punishments for him.",
        "On the morning of her wedding to Claudio, Hero wakes up early and tells her servant Ursula to wake Beatrice. Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church. They all set off together",
        "Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music",
        "Hero is dressing up for the wedding. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.",
        "Claudio and Don Pedro call on Leonato and Antonio as per the agreement. Leonato presents one of them to Claudio as Antonio's daughter whom he shall marry. Claudio accepts her hand. Don Pedro and Claudio are glad that Hero is not indeed dead, as they had been made to believe. The play ends with the news that Don John has been captured and all the characters proceed to dance.",
        "It is the wedding day and Hero is busy with preparations for the event. Margaret and Beatrice playfully exchange taunts. Then, Margaret tells Beatrice that she doesn't know why Benedick is suddenly so forlorn and subdued.",
        "The next day, Friar Francis is happy that his hunch about Hero's innocence is correct. Leonato asks all the women to withdraw into a chamber and return masked when they are called for. In the meantime, Benedick confesses his love for Beatrice to the friar and Leonato. Don Pedro and Claudio arrive at the church and are ready for the wedding. Antonio escorts the women outside and Claudio is confused at who is to be his future bride, since all the women are masked. Leonato tells Claudio that he cannot see his new bride's face until they have been married. Since the mood in the church is so happy, Benedick asks Beatrice to proclaim her love for him. They both realize that Don Pedro and Hero tricked them into loving each other. Benedick and Beatrice are happily united and everyone is merry. A messenger informs the group that Don John has come back with armed men to Messina to fight his brother. Benedick tells everyone to dance and have fun and forget about Don John until tomorrow."

Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. The ladies leave to cover their faces with veils. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio.

Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice arrives, and Margaret, in high spirits, teases her about her changed personality, saying that now Beatrice too desires a husband. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church. They all set off together",
        "Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him.

The play ends with the news that Don John has been captured and all the characters proceed to dance.",

In the meantime, Benedick confesses his love for Beatrice to the friar and Leonato. Don Pedro and Claudio arrive at the church and are ready for the wedding. Antonio escorts the women outside and Claudio is confused at who is to be his future bride, since all the women are masked. Leonato tells Claudio that he cannot see his new bride's face until they have been married. After the ceremony, the bride takes off her mask, revealing that she is none other than Hero. Friar Francis promises to tell everyone about Hero's \"death\" later on. Since the mood in the church is so happy, Benedick asks Beatrice to proclaim her love for him. They both realize that Don Pedro and Hero tricked them into loving each other. Benedick and Beatrice are happily united and everyone is merry. A messenger informs the group that Don John has come back with armed men to Messina to fight his brother. Benedick tells everyone to dance and have fun and forget about Don John until tomorrow."

        "Hero is getting dressed by Margaret for her wedding that day. She sends Ursula to fetch Beatrice, who arrives but has lost her wittiness and has also caught a cold. Margaret makes severally sexually explicit puns before mentioning to Beatrice that Benedick is now in love. Margaret then implies that perhaps Beatrice will someday decide to fall in love much the Benedick has. Ursula interrupts her and informs Hero that the men are all gathered to take her to the church",
        "Leonato sends the woman into their chambers and orders them to come out masked when they are called for. Antonio has promised to pretend that Hero is his daughter so Claudio will believe he is marrying Hero's cousin. Benedick then asks Leonato for permission to marry Beatrice at the same wedding ceremony. Leonato agrees to the marriage. Claudio and Don Pedro arrive and are greeted. The women then come out wearing masks to hide their identities. Claudio asks which lady he shall marry, and Antonio gives him Hero. She unmasks herself, causing Claudio to cry out, \"Another Hero. She replies, \"Nothing certainer\". At the wedding Benedick calls for Beatrice to reveal herself. She does, and he asks her if she loves him. Beatrice gives the surprisingly cold answer, \"Why no, no more than reason\". Benedick admits the same thing, and they both realize that they were set up by their friends. Watching this extraordinary exchange, Claudio and Hero pull out sonnets that Benedick and Beatrice wrote to each other and show them as proof that they really do love each other. Benedick and Claudio reconcile their friendship and tell Don Pedro to find himself a wife so he is not alone. A messenger arrives at the very end and informs them that Don John has been captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick tells them, \"Think not on him till tomorrow, I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.",
        "It's the morning of the wedding, and the scene is set in Hero's bedroom. Hero has sent Ursula off to go get Beatrice, and Margaret is helping Hero get dressed. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Margaret describes the beautiful dress Hero will wear as full of gold, silver, and pearls, but Hero seems uncomfortable. Instead of noting that Hero is clearly unhappy and has a weird feeling, Margaret makes a joke about the fact that soon, Hero's chest will be heavy under the weight of a husband. These people and their cheap sex jokes. Beatrice enters and, as usual, becomes the focus of attention. When she sighs, Margaret asks her if she's sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. She says she's sighing because of an \"H,\" a pun on \"ache.\" Her hints are getting pretty obvious. In response to Beatrice's tizzy, Margaret says she didn't mean anything special by using the name carduus benedictus. Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.",
        "At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Claudio takes the mystery girl's hand and swears that he's her husband, if she'll have him. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Beatrice steps forth, and then she and Benedick engage in the most silly, passive aggressive exchanges ever to happen between two lovesick people. Benedick publicly asks Beatrice if she loves him, and she denies it --kind of. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. They're about to shake hands and relegate each other to a life of being in simply the friend zone, but thankfully Hero and Claudio pipe up. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize their hands have revealed their hearts. Though they tease that they're only marrying each other out of pity, they finally just start making out . Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.",
        "Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Hero sends Ursula to bring Beatrice.

        "Hero is getting dressed by Margaret for her wedding that day. Margaret makes severally sexually explicit puns before mentioning to Beatrice that Benedick is now in love. Ursula interrupts her and informs Hero that the men are all gathered to take her to the church",
        "Leonato sends the woman into their chambers and orders them to come out masked when they are called for. Antonio has promised to pretend that Hero is his daughter so Claudio will believe he is marrying Hero's cousin. Benedick then asks Leonato for permission to marry Beatrice at the same wedding ceremony. Leonato agrees to the marriage. Claudio and Don Pedro arrive and are greeted. The women then come out wearing masks to hide their identities. Claudio asks which lady he shall marry, and Antonio gives him Hero. She unmasks herself, causing Claudio to cry out, \"Another Hero. She replies, \"Nothing certainer\". At the wedding Benedick calls for Beatrice to reveal herself. Beatrice gives the surprisingly cold answer, \"Why no, no more than reason\". Benedick admits the same thing, and they both realize that they were set up by their friends. Watching this extraordinary exchange, Claudio and Hero pull out sonnets that Benedick and Beatrice wrote to each other and show them as proof that they really do love each other. Benedick and Claudio reconcile their friendship and tell Don Pedro to find himself a wife so he is not alone. A messenger arrives at the very end and informs them that Don John has been captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick tells them, \"Think not on him till tomorrow, I'll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers\"",
        "It's the morning of the wedding, and the scene is set in Hero's bedroom. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Margaret describes the beautiful dress Hero will wear as full of gold, silver, and pearls, but Hero seems uncomfortable. Instead of noting that Hero is clearly unhappy and has a weird feeling, Margaret makes a joke about the fact that soon, Hero's chest will be heavy under the weight of a husband. These people and their cheap sex jokes. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. She says she's sighing because of an \"H,\" a pun on \"ache.\" Her hints are getting pretty obvious. She suddenly seems to be looking at love the way other women do. Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.",
        "At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Everyone's glad that Hero is innocent. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Hero says that the Hero who was slandered is dead, but this Hero--who is still an innocent maiden--lives. Prince Don Pedro then declares this is the former Hero, the one that's dead. Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Beatrice steps forth, and then she and Benedick engage in the most silly, passive aggressive exchanges ever to happen between two lovesick people. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. They're about to shake hands and relegate each other to a life of being in simply the friend zone, but thankfully Hero and Claudio pipe up. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize their hands have revealed their hearts. Though they tease that they're only marrying each other out of pity, they finally just start making out . Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.",
        "Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Hero sends Ursula to bring Beatrice. Margaret is critical of what Hero has chosen to wear but quickly backs off when Hero scolds her lightly. Margaret also teases Hero about Claudio and his soon-to-be presence in her bed. Ursula returns to tell them that the men have come to take Hero to the church.",
        "The play's final scene begins with the friar's reminder to everyone -- Leonato, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, and Benedick -- that he never doubted Hero's innocence. Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. The ladies leave to cover their faces with veils. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio. As soon as Claudio vows publicly to marry this stranger, Hero reveals her identity to the amazement of Claudio and Don Pedro. Once again Claudio is overcome with love for Hero. Meanwhile, Benedick asks which of the veiled ladies is Beatrice and asks if she loves him. Their usual denials and quick repartee continue until Claudio and Hero each produces love poems Beatrice and Benedick have written to one another. Finally, they happily accept each other. At Benedick's suggestion, dancing begins even before the marriage ceremony. A messenger interrupts the festivities with the news that Don John has been taken prisoner and is being brought back to Messina. Benedick suggests that they think about Don John tomorrow, when Benedick will invent appropriate punishments for him.",
        "On the morning of her wedding to Claudio, Hero wakes up early and tells her servant Ursula to wake Beatrice. Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church.",
        "Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music",
        "The plot does not move much in this scene. Hero is dressing up for the wedding. She says that Hero's heart will be heavier by the weight of a man-a veiled reference to marital union. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.",

        "That afternoon, Mary is busy with the garden and realizes she won't have time to see Colin. She tells Martha to let Colin know. When she returns later, Martha informs her that her absence has nearly caused Colin to throw a tantrum. Although Mary behaved in a similar way when she was in India, she has a hard time sympathizing with him in the moment. She goes to his room and they get into a big argument, with Colin accusing Mary of being selfish. Colin threatens to send away Dickon if Mary doesn't spend more time with him, which enrages Mary. She leaves the room feeling cross and unsympathetic for Colin. She returns to her room to find that Mr. Craven has sent her several nice gifts. She thinks of Colin again and remembers how often he frets about his illness and fears becoming a hunchback like his father. She decides that she will try to go to his room in the morning again to talk to him. That night, Mary wakes up to hear Colin wailing and screaming for what seems like ages. She becomes angry at his tantrum and at the fact that none of the adults have the courage to stop him. Mary, her temper rising, goes to his room and screams at the boy to stop his crying. Colin reveals that he has felt another lump in his back, which has set him off in the tantrum. Mary demands to see his back and together with the nurse they look at it and see that there is no lump. Mary tells him directly that there is nothing wrong with him and that his hysterics are what cause all his illnesses. Mary's words help Colin to snap out of his tantrum. The caretakers are amazed and let Mary put Colin to sleep. Mary tells Colin in a quiet voice about all the things she saw in the garden the day before. Her soothing stories puts him to sleep in an instant. The next day, Mary meets up with Dickon in the garden, who is accompanied by a crow, a fox, and two tame squirrels. Mary tells Dickon about the episode with Colin, and Dickon feels quite sorry for the boy. Dickon insists that they have to get Colin to come outside, where he will feel happier and be less likely to think about negative things. Mary makes Dickon laugh by trying to speak in a Yorkshire dialect. Later, she goes to see Colin. They talk about how they, along with Ben Weatherstaff, have an unpleasant look and sour demeanor in common. Colin apologizes for threatening to send Dickon away before. At that moment, Mary decides to reveal to Colin that Dickon will come to see him the next day with his animal companions. She also tells him that she found the door to the secret garden and that he will get to see the garden at last. Later that day, Dr. Craven comes to visit Colin. Mrs. Medlock tells him about Mary calming him down. The doctor is surprised to find Colin with Mary and asking if he can go out soon to get some fresh air. The doctor agrees but warns him to be careful, thinking to himself that if Colin is to get well, he will lose his inheritance of the manor. Colin says he does not want to constantly be reminded that he is sick, as this only makes him feel worse. Dr. Craven ends up staying for a very short time and not giving Colin any of the usual medicine. The next day, Mary runs into Colin's room declaring that it is spring. She excitedly tells Colin about all of the spring scenery. This morning Dickon and his animal companions--a newborn lamb, the fox, the crow, and the two squirrels--come to visit Colin in his room. Colin is delighted and amazed at the sight of Dickon and his creatures. Dickon shows Colin the animals and they look at picture books. Colin declares soon he will come to see the garden. It is over a week until the weather permits the children to return to their garden. They spend this time making preparations so that Colin is able to be transported to the garden in secrecy. One day, Colin calls for Mr. Roach, the head gardener, to come to his room for the first time. Mr. Roach is curious at this request, as he has never even seen the boy's face before. When he enters Colin's room, he is surprised by Dickon's animals. Colin gives Mr. Roach the order to keep all gardeners away from the garden walls while he is out for the day. Later, the nurse prepares Colin to go outside and he is left with Dickon and Mary, who push him in his wheelchair out into the gardens. The children show Colin all around the estate, pointing out plants and animals, which delights Colin. Enlivened by the vibrancy of nature, Colin exclaims that he will get well and that he will live forever. The whole afternoon is spent enjoying themselves in the secret garden in the particularly beautiful weather. There, Colin notices the big tree, the branch of which had killed his mother 10 years earlier. He asks if it is dead and Dickon says that it is, but that the roses growing over it make it look alive again. The robin appears just then and takes Colin's attention away from the tree. As the day winds down, Colin vows to return to the garden every day. Dickon suggests that soon Colin will be well enough to walk beside them instead of being pushed in a chair. Suddenly, they see Ben Weatherstaff's face appear above the garden wall. He is very angry to find them and starts screaming at Mary. When Ben spots Colin in the garden, he is extremely surprised. He had always thought he was a \"cripple,\" and Colin firmly tells him he is not. In his anger, Colin remarkably stands up from his chair to everyone's shock. Ben responds in tears. Colin tells Ben that he must obey him and that now he must be in on the secret of the garden.",
        "That afternoon, the weather is so perfect and Colin is so happy that he feels as though everything in the world was just made for him. The sky is blue, the fruit trees are flowering--basically, everything is beautiful and amazing in the Secret Garden. Colin notices a very old tree with a broken branch in one corner; he wonders aloud how the branch might have broken. The robin appears and starts singing, distracting Colin from this line of questioning just in time. Needless to say, Mary and Dickon are relieved not to have to explain. As the sun is getting lower, Colin suddenly looks up and asks, \"Who is that man?\" . Mary and Dickon look up to see Ben Weatherstaff on top of a ladder, looking over the garden wall. Ben shakes his fist at Mary and yells at her, saying that she has no business being in there. Dickon wheels Colin's chair over to Ben so Colin can have his say. Colin asks if Ben realizes who he is. Ben sees Colin's resemblance to his tragically deceased mom, but he calls Colin \"th'poor cripple\" . Colin is so offended at Ben's assumption that his back and legs are crooked that he finally stands up on his own. Colin's legs are thin and weak because he has never used them, but there is nothing really wrong with him except fear. Now Colin has the confidence to tell Ben to leave them alone with their Secret Garden. For his part, Ben is quite overcome with emotion by the sight of Colin standing tall on his own.",
        "In the garden, Mary and Dickon begin speaking Yorkshire dialect, and, for the first time, Colin joins them. He wonders aloud if the beauty of the landscape is not, perhaps, somehow intended for him. Mary and Dickon set about showing him all the treasures of the garden, but hesitate when Colin asks about the great gray tree from which his mother fell to her death. Dickon remarks that roses will soon grow over its bark, hiding the dead wood and making it the loveliest thing in the garden. By a stroke of magical good fortune, the robin briefly appears and distracts Colin from his contemplation of the tree. Mrs. Sowerby, Dickon's mother, suspects that Colin's mother is somehow still in the secret garden, still watching over her son, and that it is her influence that has brought the three children to the garden. Privately, Mary believes this to be a part of what she calls \"Magic,\" of the kind that Dickon works on everything that comes near to him. Colin tells Mary and Dickon that he intends to come out with them every day, and that soon he shall walk on his own and be strong enough to work in the garden. Suddenly, the furious face of Ben Weatherstaff appears over the garden wall; he is astonished to see the children in the formerly locked garden. In his shock at seeing Colin, Ben Weatherstaff calls him \"the poor cripple\" and asks if he has crooked legs and a crooked back. Colin is incensed, and, with surprising strength, suddenly rises from his wheeled chair and commands the old man to look at him, so that Ben might attest to his unquestionable soundness. He then instructs Ben Weatherstaff to join them in the garden, so that he might speak with him"

        "Act II begins the following morning, as Christy, alone, counts the pub's crockery and glassware. He notes that he seemed ugly in his home mirror. When he hears some women outside, he quickly hides. Four village girls - Susan Brady, Sara Tansey, Nelly, and Honor Blake - enter. They have heard about Christy, and want to see him for themselves. They soon enough find him hiding, and then shyly offer some presents: duck eggs, butter, cake and a chicken. They flirt with him a bit, and then Widow Quin enters, announcing that she has registered Christy for the sports competition happening down on the beach. The women expect that he will prove a peerless athlete. As the girls and the widow prepare breakfast for him, Christy fleshes out the story of the murder. His father had ordered Christy to marry a fat, ugly widow-woman twice his age. When Christy refused, his father threatened him with a scythe, and Christy in turn threatened his father with a spade. When his father struck at him, Christy feinted and then delivered the fatal blow to the older man's skull. Susan teases that the Lord God has sent Christy to their village to wed the Widow Quin. The widow and Christy link arms, and drink a toast \"to the wonders of the western world\" . Pegeen enters to see the toast, and kicks the women out. She then accuses Christy of flirting, which he denies. He grabs a spade and holds it out to remind her of his great, heroic deed, but she scoffs at him. When he counters that the women were interested in his story, she insinuates that they will gossip about him and hence increase his chances of being apprehended. She then describes in detail a story she read in the paper, about a man recently hanged. The description completely unnerves Christy, who prepares to flee. However, Pegeen calms him down, insisting she was only mocking him, and that she has found no mention of his crime in the paper. Pegeen and Christy then exchange kind, tender fantasies about the future they might share together. Shawn Keogh runs in with the Widow Quin. Shawn warns Pegeen that her family's sheep are eating cabbage in a neighbor's field, and hence might burst their stomachs. Pegeen runs out to collect her sheep, at which point Shawn offers Christy a one-way ticket to the \"Western States\" , his new hat, his excellent breeches, his new coat, and his blessing if Christy will agree to leave the village. Christy rejects this offer. However, the widow exhorts him to try on the new clothes so he will have something nice to wear for the competition, and Christy accepts. He leaves the room to change clothing. While Christy is gone, Shawn promises Widow Quin a ewe if she can interrupt the burgeoning relationship between Pegeen and the stranger. The widow asks what Shawn would pay if she could get Christy to marry her, and Shawn names just about everything he owns. The deal is struck. Christy parades back in, now wearing Shawn's clothes. After giving his compliments, Shawn races out. Christy continues to prance about, imagining a future of fine clothes and gifts celebrating his triumphant deed. Christy hides just as Old Mahon enters. Old Mahon immediately inquires whether the widow has seen a young fellow, whom he has been tracking for ten days. He removes his hat to reveal a vicious, semi-bandaged wound, and then describes the young fellow as his stupid, useless, and dirty son. He further describes the son - Christy, of course - as too weak to drink or smoke a pipe, and as absurdly fearful of women. In fact, Christy is the butt of his own townswomen's jokes. The widow asserts that she has seen a young man who meets the description, but that he has traveled over the hills to catch a steamer. Mahon exits abruptly to chase after this lead. His father gone, Christy wonders why the man pretended to be dead, and wishes a violent death for him now. His venom shocks the widow. Christy then grows suddenly tearful as he imagines losing the new life with Pegeen that he was on the verge of beginning. The widow softly suggests that she and Christy are alike in character, each with a melancholy side that accompanies having killed a close relation. She begins to paint a picture of a tender future they might share together, but Christy hardly hears her, as the sound of the approaching girls interrupts them. Christy begs the widow to help him win Pegeen. Just like that, Widow Quin relinquishes her own design on Christy, and agrees to keep his secret. If Old Mahon should return, she will swear he is a lunatic. Sarah, Honor and Susan enter to lead Christy down to the beach so he can compete in the sports. Once they leave, Widow Quin reflects that even if his secret is revealed, she will end up with him as husband as consolation, since he will have nobody else to turn to."

        "At the Cardinal's palace in Rome, Julia, the Cardinal's mistress and Castruccio's wife, explains how she convinced her husband to let her go to Rome without him. Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. She says she will ask her husband--he doesn't know if she's joking or not--and leaves. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out",
        "Scene Four is set at the Shrine of Our Lady of Loretto. Here, the Cardinal gives up his cardinal's hat in a ceremony so that he can fight as a soldier. Antonio, the Duchess, and their children arrive, and are banished from Ancona. This all happens in pantomime while the churchmen sing a solemn song. They all exit except for two pilgrims, who discuss what happened and explain that the Pope, spurred by the Cardinal, took the Duchess's dukedom from her",
        "Scene Four returns to the residence of the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. The Cardinal tells them not to stay with Ferdinand tonight because having people around makes him worse, although in reality he simply wants to ensure that no one is around when he gets rid of Julia's body. He further tells them of a plan to imitate Ferdinand's insanity in an attempt to get his confidence, and so they should ignore any extreme sounds or cries they might hear. They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. Everyone leaves except the Cardinal. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. The Cardinal exits, and Bosola enters, having overheard the Cardinal's plan to kill him. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally.

The Cardinal is talking to Castruchio's wife Julia, saying something along the lines of, \"so, what did you tell your husband this time to get yourself out here?\" Julia and the Cardinal.

Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. Gee, what a keeper.

It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess.

They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished.

Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered.

        "Inside Petruchio's country abode, Grumio is busy making a fire and complaining about the cold in preparation for his master and mistress' arrival. Curtis, another of Petruchio's servants, has not yet met the new bride and asks if she is as shrewish as reported. Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. Kate begs her husband not to behave so unjustly. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. He reappears and explains his intention to tame the shrew by out-shrewing her: he will mistreat her and deprive her of what she needs, all under the guise of kindness and love. Thus, by insisting that neither her food nor her bed are worthy of her, he will wear out her spirit with lack of nourishment and sleep. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Hortensio states that he has decided to wed a wealthy widow instead of Bianca, leaving \"Cambio\" to woo Bianca alone. Biondello rushes in to aid their attempt, claiming that an old Pedant from Mantua approaches. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Katharina then loses her temper and beats Grumio. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. He demands that Katharina thank him for the meat while telling Hortensio to eat it all himself. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. A Haberdasher and Tailor appear, with a cap and gown respectively. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" Katharina notes that it is already two o'clock, prompting her husband to berate her for constantly contradicting him. Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt. Tranio offers his own house, noting that the banquet will not be a grand affair but promising a better one later on in Pisa. Lucentio and Bianca, meanwhile, on Biondello's advice, elope to be married post-haste while Baptista is with Tranio and the Pedant. In scene five, Kate and Petruchio are on the road to Padua again. Petruchio continues his shrewish behavior, insisting that the sun is the moon and threatening to turn the cart around if Kate doesn't agree. Kate finally begins to play along, agreeing that the sun is the moon and then changing her opinion when Petruchio changes his. This game is interrupted by the appearance of the real Vincentio, Lucentio's father, whom Petruchio refers to as a \"gentlewoman\" ; he insists that Kate agree, and she does so, calling him a \"budding virgin.\" A bit shaken by their jesting, Vincentio introduces himself, noting that he is on his way to Padua to visit his son. Petruchio informs the man that they are now family - for Lucentio has married the sister of Katharina. Vincentio is shocked and asks Petruchio if he is joking. Petruchio assures him that he is not and invites Vincentio along.

        "Inside Petruchio's country abode, Grumio is busy making a fire and complaining about the cold in preparation for his master and mistress' arrival. Curtis, another of Petruchio's servants, has not yet met the new bride and asks if she is as shrewish as reported. Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. He reappears and explains his intention to tame the shrew by out-shrewing her: he will mistreat her and deprive her of what she needs, all under the guise of kindness and love. Thus, by insisting that neither her food nor her bed are worthy of her, he will wear out her spirit with lack of nourishment and sleep. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Hortensio states that he has decided to wed a wealthy widow instead of Bianca, leaving \"Cambio\" to woo Bianca alone. Biondello rushes in to aid their attempt, claiming that an old Pedant from Mantua approaches. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Katharina then loses her temper and beats Grumio. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. He demands that Katharina thank him for the meat while telling Hortensio to eat it all himself. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. A Haberdasher and Tailor appear, with a cap and gown respectively. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" He calls for the horses and proclaims he will be at the house by noon. Katharina notes that it is already two o'clock, prompting her husband to berate her for constantly contradicting him. Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt.
