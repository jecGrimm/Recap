        "George is still with Sir Dedlock, now recuperating at Chesney Wold. One day, though, George rides north to the industrial factory towns up there. George is kind of overwhelmed by how important his brother has apparently become and wants to turn back...but doesn't. George introduces himself as Mr. Steel, but as soon as he opens his mouth, his brother recognizes him and is hugely thrilled to see him. George is floored. There's an engagement party going on for Watt and Rosa, and George becomes the guest of honor. The next day George tells his brother that he's happy except for one thing: he wants to be removed from Mrs. Rouncewell's will. This makes George happy. His brother immediately offers him a job, but George says he's best off helping out Sir Dedlock for now. His brother is sort of not into this, but George explains that they are different people and that George really likes being commanded, like he was in the army. Finally George shows his brother a letter he's written to Esther explaining that he only passed along Captain Hawdon's note as a handwriting sample, and that if he'd known Hawdon was alive he would have found him and taken care of him.",

Then he writes to Esther, telling her that the letter written to him long ago by Captain Hawdon, the one taken by Detective Bucket, was a note of no particular consequence.

        "\"Steel and Iron\" The narrator says that George's Shooting Gallery is closed now and that George lives at Chesney Wold. George rides into the iron country and seeks out the Rouncewells, who are well known in the town. A workman points George in the right direction to the Rouncewells' factory. When George reaches the factory, he meets his brother's son, who leads George to his brother. George accompanies them to their house and meets his nieces and Rosa. The next day, the brother tells George how he might join the business, but George asks him to promise that he'll get Mrs. Rouncewell to remove George from her will. George assures him that their fortunes will not be reduced and that he'll give up any part of the will he receives. Before George leaves, he asks his brother to read a letter he's written. It's to Esther, and it explains that he received a letter from Bucket that had been addressed to him by \"a certain person\" and was found among this certain person's papers. He wants Esther to know that the letter was a list of instructions from overseas about how he should go about sending a letter, which had been enclosed, to a young woman in England. George says that he gave up the letter because he thought it was needed only as a handwriting sample and that he never meant to cause any harm. George also says that if he'd known \"a certain unfortunate gentleman\" was alive, he would have helped him, but this person had been reported drowned. George sends the letter and returns to Chesney Wold",
