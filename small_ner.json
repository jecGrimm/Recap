The boy is brought in semi-conscious on a mattress, accompanied by a crowd including Jim, in chains, and the doctor.  Some of the local men would like to hang Jim but are unwilling to risk having to compensate Jim's master.  They treat Jim roughly and chain him hand and foot inside the shed.  The doctor intervenes, telling the crowd how Jim has sacrificed his freedom to help nurse Tom.  Sally, meanwhile, stays at Tom's bedside, glad that his condition has improved.  Tom wakes and gleefully details how they set Jim free.
