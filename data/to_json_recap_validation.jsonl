Soon he invites Esther to join them. He has settled Allan in a new \\\"Bleak House.\\\" Upon seeing Esther's face when she reads the name of the new house, Jarndyce decides not to be selfish and releases Esther from her promise to marry him. He knows that she will be happier as Allan's wife than she would be as his. Esther is dumbfounded. Allan accepts Jarndyce's offer of Esther's hand, and Esther agrees. Esther passes from being the mistress of one Bleak House, to being mistress of the new one. Mr. Guppy, back at the St Alban's Bleak House, still pursues Esther. He has set up a business with Jobling, and has brought his mother to propose marriage to Esther again. Jarndyce doesn't even have to consult Esther to know that she will refuse him, and he refuses for her. In a funny scene, Mrs. Guppy is so put out by her refusal that she orders Mr. Jarndyce out of his own room in his own house. Esther's scars are slowly fading, and her good looks are coming back. In Chapter 65 the Jarndyce case is finallly ready to be argued before the court, but in Westminster Hall. On the way, the young people see Caddy Turveydrop, who congratulates Esther on her engagement to Woodcourt, and embraces her. They arrive late in court, and they learn that, although the estate would have been conferred entirely on Ada and Richard, it has been completely consumed in costs. The irony is so great that even though Richard, who is very ill, resolves to \\\"begin the world,\\\" he dies that day. Miss Flite arrives, weeping. She has finally freed her birds. In Chapter 66, we learn that Lady Dedlock, her body retrieved by her husband, has been buried in the family mausoleum at Chesney Wold. The world does not know how she died, and Sir Leicester keeps it a mystery. He rides around the estate with George, honoring her memory. The dispute with Boythorn continues, but with less real vehemence on both sides. The world of Chesney Wold becomes quieter, as Sir Leicester is an aging widower uninterested in society. He confers the estate on Volumnia. The final chapter jumps forward seven years to the happy Esther Woodcourt living in Lincolnshire. She and Allan are blessed with two little girls, and Ada's little boy, named Richard, was born not long after his father's death. Ada divides her time between both Bleak Houses. Esther's maid, Charley, is happily married to a miller. Esther now has little Emma, the youngest Neckett, as a maid. We have one more look at Mrs. Jellyby, how has decided that Africa is a lost cause and now campaigns for women in Parliament. Caddy is a happy wife and mother, though her child is deaf and dumb, and Prince has grown lame from too much dancing. Even Peepy Jellyby is reprised, all grown up and preparing to go into the Custom House like his father. Jarndyce, Ada, Woodcourt, and Allan all live happily ever after.\", \"analysis\": \"Dicken's bright and happy ending is only marred by the death of Richard .  The fact that none of the surviving main characters are interested with documents or suits or \\\"signs and tokens\\\" ensures their happiness.  The feelings is that most of the people who have lived through this novel have gotten their just desserts.  Only Jenny the brickmaker's wife is left out of the winding up. The surprising happy ending of Sir Leicester is perhaps the least expected of the bunch.  Also, Esther's wish that Jarndyce not marry anyone else is fulfiled, and Jarndyce remains the foster father\/Guardian of Ada and Esther. This novel has so many parallels between characters that sometimes multiple ones can be drawn.  The Skimpole\/Turveydrop characters of superficiality, the Jenny\/Lady Dedlock polar opposites, the high and low extremes of Sir Leicester and Jo the Crossing Sweeper are only a few.  Dickens delighted in repeating his ideas in different characters, as well as injecting wholly unique ones, like Inspector Bucket, into the mix. To some critics, the ending of Esther with Woodcourt seems a bit saccharine.  That a destitute young woman who depended soley on her Guardian for her support would hesitate to marry him has been criticized as anti-intuitive, especially regarding Esther's commitment to duty.  Also, Ada's misguided love of Richard, and her ineffectuality at saving him, has been put forward as proof that Dickens didn't have much respect for women's powers of persuasion. But the domestic bliss that intermittently pops up, and, ultimately triumphs in the end of Bleak House has the marks of authenticity to it.  Dickens really did believe that it was the most important state, and considered it far more important than any institution of his day.  This novel clearly illustrates his belief, and does a very good job of convincing the reader of it, too.\"}","chapter":"\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nSoon after I had that conversation with my guardian, he put a sealed\npaper in my hand one morning and said, \"This is for next month, my\ndear.\" I found in it two hundred pounds.\n\nI now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were\nnecessary. Regulating my purchases by my guardian's taste, which I\nknew very well of course, I arranged my wardrobe to please him and\nhoped I should be highly successful. I did it all so quietly because\nI was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be\nrather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself. I had no\ndoubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the\nmost private and simple manner. Perhaps I should only have to say to\nAda, \"Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow, my pet?\"\nPerhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her own, and I\nmight not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was\nover. I thought that if I were to choose, I would like this best.\n\nThe only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt. I told her that I was\ngoing to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some\ntime. She highly approved. She could never do enough for me and was\nremarkably softened now in comparison with what she had been when we\nfirst knew her. There was no trouble she would not have taken to have\nbeen of use to me, but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to\ntake as little as gratified her kindness without tasking it.\n\nOf course this was not a time to neglect my guardian, and of course\nit was not a time for neglecting my darling. So I had plenty of\noccupation, which I was glad of; and as to Charley, she was\nabsolutely not to be seen for needlework. To surround herself with\ngreat heaps of it--baskets full and tables full--and do a little, and\nspend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what\nthere was to do, and persuade herself that she was going to do it,\nwere Charley's great dignities and delights.\n\nMeanwhile, I must say, I could not agree with my guardian on the\nsubject of the will, and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and\nJarndyce. Which of us was right will soon appear, but I certainly did\nencourage expectations. In Richard, the discovery gave occasion for a\nburst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time,\nbut he had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to\nretain only its feverish anxieties. From something my guardian said\none day when we were talking about this, I understood that my\nmarriage would not take place until after the term-time we had been\ntold to look forward to; and I thought the more, for that, how\nrejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were\na little more prosperous.\n\nThe term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town\nand went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt's business. He had told\nme beforehand that his presence there would be necessary. I had just\ncome in one night from my dear girl's and was sitting in the midst of\nall my new clothes, looking at them all around me and thinking, when\na letter from my guardian was brought to me. It asked me to join him\nin the country and mentioned by what stage-coach my place was taken\nand at what time in the morning I should have to leave town. It added\nin a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada.\n\nI expected few things less than a journey at that time, but I was\nready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next\nmorning. I travelled all day, wondering all day what I could be\nwanted for at such a distance; now I thought it might be for this\npurpose, and now I thought it might be for that purpose, but I was\nnever, never, never near the truth.\n\nIt was night when I came to my journey's end and found my guardian\nwaiting for me. This was a great relief, for towards evening I had\nbegun to fear (the more so as his letter was a very short one) that\nhe might be ill. However, there he was, as well as it was possible to\nbe; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best, I\nsaid to myself, he has been doing some other great kindness. Not that\nit required much penetration to say that, because I knew that his\nbeing there at all was an act of kindness.\n\nSupper was ready at the hotel, and when we were alone at table he\nsaid, \"Full of curiosity, no doubt, little woman, to know why I have\nbrought you here?\"\n\n\"Well, guardian,\" said I, \"without thinking myself a Fatima or you a\nBlue Beard, I am a little curious about it.\"\n\n\"Then to ensure your night's rest, my love,\" he returned gaily, \"I\nwon't wait until to-morrow to tell you. I have very much wished to\nexpress to Woodcourt, somehow, my sense of his humanity to poor\nunfortunate Jo, his inestimable services to my young cousins, and his\nvalue to us all. When it was decided that he should settle here, it\ncame into my head that I might ask his acceptance of some\nunpretending and suitable little place to lay his own head in. I\ntherefore caused such a place to be looked out for, and such a place\nwas found on very easy terms, and I have been touching it up for him\nand making it habitable. However, when I walked over it the day\nbefore yesterday and it was reported ready, I found that I was not\nhousekeeper enough to know whether things were all as they ought to\nbe. So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly\nbe got to come and give me her advice and opinion. And here she is,\"\nsaid my guardian, \"laughing and crying both together!\"\n\nBecause he was so dear, so good, so admirable. I tried to tell him\nwhat I thought of him, but I could not articulate a word.\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" said my guardian. \"You make too much of it, little woman.\nWhy, how you sob, Dame Durden, how you sob!\"\n\n\"It is with exquisite pleasure, guardian--with a heart full of\nthanks.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he. \"I am delighted that you approve. I thought\nyou would. I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress\nof Bleak House.\"\n\nI kissed him and dried my eyes. \"I know now!\" said I. \"I have seen\nthis in your face a long while.\"\n\n\"No; have you really, my dear?\" said he. \"What a Dame Durden it is to\nread a face!\"\n\nHe was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise, and\nwas almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all. When I went to\nbed, I cried. I am bound to confess that I cried; but I hope it was\nwith pleasure, though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure. I\nrepeated every word of the letter twice over.\n\nA most beautiful summer morning succeeded, and after breakfast we\nwent out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty\nhousekeeping opinion. We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side\nwall, of which he had the key, and the first thing I saw was that the\nbeds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds\nand flowers at home.\n\n\"You see, my dear,\" observed my guardian, standing still with a\ndelighted face to watch my looks, \"knowing there could be no better\nplan, I borrowed yours.\"\n\nWe went on by a pretty little orchard, where the cherries were\nnestling among the green leaves and the shadows of the apple-trees\nwere sporting on the grass, to the house itself--a cottage, quite a\nrustic cottage of doll's rooms; but such a lovely place, so tranquil\nand so beautiful, with such a rich and smiling country spread around\nit; with water sparkling away into the distance, here all overhung\nwith summer-growth, there turning a humming mill; at its nearest\npoint glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town, where\ncricket-players were assembling in bright groups and a flag was\nflying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind. And\nstill, as we went through the pretty rooms, out at the little rustic\nverandah doors, and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades garlanded\nwith woodbine, jasmine, and honey-suckle, I saw in the papering on\nthe walls, in the colours of the furniture, in the arrangement of all\nthe pretty objects, MY little tastes and fancies, MY little methods\nand inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them,\nmy odd ways everywhere.\n\nI could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful,\nbut one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this, I thought, oh,\nwould he be the happier for it! Would it not have been better for his\npeace that I should not have been so brought before him? Because\nalthough I was not what he thought me, still he loved me very dearly,\nand it might remind him mournfully of what be believed he had lost. I\ndid not wish him to forget me--perhaps he might not have done so,\nwithout these aids to his memory--but my way was easier than his, and\nI could have reconciled myself even to that so that he had been the\nhappier for it.\n\n\"And now, little woman,\" said my guardian, whom I had never seen so\nproud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my\nappreciation of them, \"now, last of all, for the name of this house.\"\n\n\"What is it called, dear guardian?\"\n\n\"My child,\" said he, \"come and see,\"\n\nHe took me to the porch, which he had hitherto avoided, and said,\npausing before we went out, \"My dear child, don't you guess the\nname?\"\n\n\"No!\" said I.\n\nWe went out of the porch and he showed me written over it, Bleak\nHouse.\n\nHe led me to a seat among the leaves close by, and sitting down\nbeside me and taking my hand in his, spoke to me thus, \"My darling\ngirl, in what there has been between us, I have, I hope, been really\nsolicitous for your happiness. When I wrote you the letter to which\nyou brought the answer,\" smiling as he referred to it, \"I had my own\ntoo much in view; but I had yours too. Whether, under different\ncircumstances, I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes\ndreamed when you were very young, of making you my wife one day, I\nneed not ask myself. I did renew it, and I wrote my letter, and you\nbrought your answer. You are following what I say, my child?\"\n\nI was cold, and I trembled violently, but not a word he uttered was\nlost. As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun's rays descended,\nsoftly shining through the leaves upon his bare head, I felt as if\nthe brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels.\n\n\"Hear me, my love, but do not speak. It is for me to speak now. When\nit was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really\nmake you happy is no matter. Woodcourt came home, and I soon had no\ndoubt at all.\"\n\nI clasped him round the neck and hung my head upon his breast and\nwept. \"Lie lightly, confidently here, my child,\" said he, pressing me\ngently to him. \"I am your guardian and your father now. Rest\nconfidently here.\"\n\nSoothingly, like the gentle rustling of the leaves; and genially,\nlike the ripening weather; and radiantly and beneficently, like the\nsunshine, he went on.\n\n\"Understand me, my dear girl. I had no doubt of your being contented\nand happy with me, being so dutiful and so devoted; but I saw with\nwhom you would be happier. That I penetrated his secret when Dame\nDurden was blind to it is no wonder, for I knew the good that could\nnever change in her better far than she did. Well! I have long been\nin Allan Woodcourt's confidence, although he was not, until\nyesterday, a few hours before you came here, in mine. But I would not\nhave my Esther's bright example lost; I would not have a jot of my\ndear girl's virtues unobserved and unhonoured; I would not have her\nadmitted on sufferance into the line of Morgan ap-Kerrig, no, not for\nthe weight in gold of all the mountains in Wales!\"\n\nHe stopped to kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh.\nFor I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise.\n\n\"Hush, little woman! Don't cry; this is to be a day of joy. I have\nlooked forward to it,\" he said exultingly, \"for months on months! A\nfew words more, Dame Trot, and I have said my say. Determined not to\nthrow away one atom of my Esther's worth, I took Mrs. Woodcourt into\na separate confidence. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'I clearly perceive--and\nindeed I know, to boot--that your son loves my ward. I am further\nvery sure that my ward loves your son, but will sacrifice her love to\na sense of duty and affection, and will sacrifice it so completely,\nso entirely, so religiously, that you should never suspect it though\nyou watched her night and day.' Then I told her all our\nstory--ours--yours and mine. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'come you, knowing\nthis, and live with us. Come you, and see my child from hour to hour;\nset what you see against her pedigree, which is this, and this'--for\nI scorned to mince it--'and tell me what is the true legitimacy when\nyou shall have quite made up your mind on that subject.' Why, honour\nto her old Welsh blood, my dear,\" cried my guardian with enthusiasm,\n\"I believe the heart it animates beats no less warmly, no less\nadmiringly, no less lovingly, towards Dame Durden than my own!\"\n\nHe tenderly raised my head, and as I clung to him, kissed me in his\nold fatherly way again and again. What a light, now, on the\nprotecting manner I had thought about!\n\n\"One more last word. When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you, my dear, he\nspoke with my knowledge and consent--but I gave him no encouragement,\nnot I, for these surprises were my great reward, and I was too\nmiserly to part with a scrap of it. He was to come and tell me all\nthat passed, and he did. I have no more to say. My dearest, Allan\nWoodcourt stood beside your father when he lay dead--stood beside\nyour mother. This is Bleak House. This day I give this house its\nlittle mistress; and before God, it is the brightest day in all my\nlife!\"\n\nHe rose and raised me with him. We were no longer alone. My\nhusband--I have called him by that name full seven happy years\nnow--stood at my side.\n\n\"Allan,\" said my guardian, \"take from me a willing gift, the best\nwife that ever man had. What more can I say for you than that I know\nyou deserve her! Take with her the little home she brings you. You\nknow what she will make it, Allan; you know what she has made its\nnamesake. Let me share its felicity sometimes, and what do I\nsacrifice? Nothing, nothing.\"\n\nHe kissed me once again, and now the tears were in his eyes as he\nsaid more softly, \"Esther, my dearest, after so many years, there is\na kind of parting in this too. I know that my mistake has caused you\nsome distress. Forgive your old guardian, in restoring him to his old\nplace in your affections; and blot it out of your memory. Allan, take\nmy dear.\"\n\nHe moved away from under the green roof of leaves, and stopping in\nthe sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us, said, \"I\nshall be found about here somewhere. It's a west wind, little woman,\ndue west! Let no one thank me any more, for I am going to revert to\nmy bachelor habits, and if anybody disregards this warning, I'll run\naway and never come back!\"\n\nWhat happiness was ours that day, what joy, what rest, what hope,\nwhat gratitude, what bliss! We were to be married before the month\nwas out, but when we were to come and take possession of our own\nhouse was to depend on Richard and Ada.\n\nWe all three went home together next day. As soon as we arrived in\ntown, Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news\nto him and my darling. Late as it was, I meant to go to her for a few\nminutes before lying down to sleep, but I went home with my guardian\nfirst to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his\nside, for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon.\n\nWhen we came home we found that a young man had called three times in\nthe course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the\noccasion of his third call that I was not expected to return before\nten o'clock at night, he had left word that he would call about then.\nHe had left his card three times. Mr. Guppy.\n\nAs I naturally speculated on the object of these visits, and as I\nalways associated something ludicrous with the visitor, it fell out\nthat in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old\nproposal and his subsequent retraction. \"After that,\" said my\nguardian, \"we will certainly receive this hero.\" So instructions were\ngiven that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again, and they\nwere scarcely given when he did come again.\n\nHe was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me, but recovered\nhimself and said, \"How de do, sir?\"\n\n\"How do you do, sir?\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"Thank you, sir, I am tolerable,\" returned Mr. Guppy. \"Will you allow\nme to introduce my mother, Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road, and my\nparticular friend, Mr. Weevle. That is to say, my friend has gone by\nthe name of Weevle, but his name is really and truly Jobling.\"\n\nMy guardian begged them to be seated, and they all sat down.\n\n\"Tony,\" said Mr. Guppy to his friend after an awkward silence. \"Will\nyou open the case?\"\n\n\"Do it yourself,\" returned the friend rather tartly.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Jarndyce, sir,\" Mr. Guppy, after a moment's consideration,\nbegan, to the great diversion of his mother, which she displayed by\nnudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most\nremarkable manner, \"I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by\nherself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence. But\nMiss Summerson has mentioned to you, perhaps, that something has\npassed between us on former occasions?\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" returned my guardian, smiling, \"has made a\ncommunication to that effect to me.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"makes matters easier. Sir, I have come out\nof my articles at Kenge and Carboy's, and I believe with satisfaction\nto all parties. I am now admitted (after undergoing an examination\nthat's enough to badger a man blue, touching a pack of nonsense that\nhe don't want to know) on the roll of attorneys and have taken out my\ncertificate, if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Guppy,\" returned my guardian. \"I am quite willing--I\nbelieve I use a legal phrase--to admit the certificate.\"\n\nMr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his pocket\nand proceeded without it.\n\n\"I have no capital myself, but my mother has a little property which\ntakes the form of an annuity\"--here Mr. Guppy's mother rolled her\nhead as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation, and\nput her handkerchief to her mouth, and again winked at me--\"and a few\npounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never\nbe wanting, free of interest, which is an advantage, you know,\" said\nMr. Guppy feelingly.\n\n\"Certainly an advantage,\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"I HAVE some connexion,\" pursued Mr. Guppy, \"and it lays in the\ndirection of Walcot Square, Lambeth. I have therefore taken a 'ouse\nin that locality, which, in the opinion of my friends, is a hollow\nbargain (taxes ridiculous, and use of fixtures included in the rent),\nand intend setting up professionally for myself there forthwith.\"\n\nHere Mr. Guppy's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling\nher head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her.\n\n\"It's a six-roomer, exclusive of kitchens,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"and in\nthe opinion of my friends, a commodious tenement. When I mention my\nfriends, I refer principally to my friend Jobling, who I believe has\nknown me,\" Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air, \"from\nboyhood's hour.\"\n\nMr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs.\n\n\"My friend Jobling will render me his assistance in the capacity of\nclerk and will live in the 'ouse,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"My mother will\nlikewise live in the 'ouse when her present quarter in the Old Street\nRoad shall have ceased and expired; and consequently there will be no\nwant of society. My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by\ntaste, and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper\ncircles, fully backs me in the intentions I am now developing.\"\n\nMr. Jobling said \"Certainly\" and withdrew a little from the elbow of\nMr Guppy's mother.\n\n\"Now, I have no occasion to mention to you, sir, you being in the\nconfidence of Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"(mother, I wish you'd\nbe so good as to keep still), that Miss Summerson's image was\nformerly imprinted on my 'eart and that I made her a proposal of\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"That I have heard,\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"Circumstances,\" pursued Mr. Guppy, \"over which I had no control, but\nquite the contrary, weakened the impression of that image for a time.\nAt which time Miss Summerson's conduct was highly genteel; I may even\nadd, magnanimous.\"\n\nMy guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"I have got into that state of mind\nmyself that I wish for a reciprocity of magnanimous behaviour. I wish\nto prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a heighth of which\nperhaps she hardly thought me capable. I find that the image which I\ndid suppose had been eradicated from my 'eart is NOT eradicated. Its\ninfluence over me is still tremenjous, and yielding to it, I am\nwilling to overlook the circumstances over which none of us have had\nany control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I\nhad the honour to make at a former period. I beg to lay the 'ouse in\nWalcot Square, the business, and myself before Miss Summerson for her\nacceptance.\"\n\n\"Very magnanimous indeed, sir,\" observed my guardian.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Mr. Guppy with candour, \"my wish is to BE\nmagnanimous. I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss\nSummerson I am by any means throwing myself away; neither is that the\nopinion of my friends. Still, there are circumstances which I submit\nmay be taken into account as a set off against any little drawbacks\nof mine, and so a fair and equitable balance arrived at.\"\n\n\"I take upon myself, sir,\" said my guardian, laughing as he rang the\nbell, \"to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson. She is\nvery sensible of your handsome intentions, and wishes you good\nevening, and wishes you well.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Guppy with a blank look. \"Is that tantamount, sir, to\nacceptance, or rejection, or consideration?\"\n\n\"To decided rejection, if you please,\" returned my guardian.\n\nMr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend, and at his mother, who\nsuddenly turned very angry, and at the floor, and at the ceiling.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said he. \"Then, Jobling, if you was the friend you\nrepresent yourself, I should think you might hand my mother out of\nthe gangway instead of allowing her to remain where she ain't\nwanted.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway. She\nwouldn't hear of it. \"Why, get along with you,\" said she to my\nguardian, \"what do you mean? Ain't my son good enough for you? You\nought to be ashamed of yourself. Get out with you!\"\n\n\"My good lady,\" returned my guardian, \"it is hardly reasonable to ask\nme to get out of my own room.\"\n\n\"I don't care for that,\" said Mrs. Guppy. \"Get out with you. If we\nain't good enough for you, go and procure somebody that is good\nenough. Go along and find 'em.\"\n\nI was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy's\npower of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest\noffence.\n\n\"Go along and find somebody that's good enough for you,\" repeated\nMrs. Guppy. \"Get out!\" Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy's mother\nso much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out.\n\"Why don't you get out?\" said Mrs. Guppy. \"What are you stopping here\nfor?\"\n\n\"Mother,\" interposed her son, always getting before her and pushing\nher back with one shoulder as she sidled at my guardian, \"WILL you\nhold your tongue?\"\n\n\"No, William,\" she returned, \"I won't! Not unless he gets out, I\nwon't!\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy's\nmother (who began to be quite abusive) and took her, very much\nagainst her will, downstairs, her voice rising a stair higher every\ntime her figure got a stair lower, and insisting that we should\nimmediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us, and\nabove all things that we should get out.\n\n\n\n\nBeginning the World\n\n\nThe term had commenced, and my guardian found an intimation from Mr.\nKenge that the cause would come on in two days. As I had sufficient\nhopes of the will to be in a flutter about it, Allan and I agreed to\ngo down to the court that morning. Richard was extremely agitated and\nwas so weak and low, though his illness was still of the mind, that\nmy dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported. But she looked\nforward--a very little way now--to the help that was to come to her,\nand never drooped.\n\nIt was at Westminster that the cause was to come on. It had come on\nthere, I dare say, a hundred times before, but I could not divest\nmyself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now. We left home\ndirectly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and\nwalked down there through the lively streets--so happily and\nstrangely it seemed!--together.\n\nAs we were going along, planning what we should do for Richard and\nAda, I heard somebody calling \"Esther! My dear Esther! Esther!\" And\nthere was Caddy Jellyby, with her head out of the window of a little\ncarriage which she hired now to go about in to her pupils (she had so\nmany), as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards' distance. I\nhad written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done,\nbut had not had a moment to go and see her. Of course we turned back,\nand the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture, and was so\noverjoyed to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers,\nand was so determined to squeeze my face (bonnet and all) between her\nhands, and go on in a wild manner altogether, calling me all kinds of\nprecious names, and telling Allan I had done I don't know what for\nher, that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm\nher down by letting her say and do exactly what she liked. Allan,\nstanding at the window, was as pleased as Caddy; and I was as pleased\nas either of them; and I wonder that I got away as I did, rather than\nthat I came off laughing, and red, and anything but tidy, and looking\nafter Caddy, who looked after us out of the coach-window as long as\nshe could see us.\n\nThis made us some quarter of an hour late, and when we came to\nWestminster Hall we found that the day's business was begun. Worse\nthan that, we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery\nthat it was full to the door, and we could neither see nor hear what\nwas passing within. It appeared to be something droll, for\noccasionally there was a laugh and a cry of \"Silence!\" It appeared to\nbe something interesting, for every one was pushing and striving to\nget nearer. It appeared to be something that made the professional\ngentlemen very merry, for there were several young counsellors in\nwigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd, and when one of them\ntold the others about it, they put their hands in their pockets, and\nquite doubled themselves up with laughter, and went stamping about\nthe pavement of the Hall.\n\nWe asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on. He told us\nJarndyce and Jarndyce. We asked him if he knew what was doing in it.\nHe said really, no he did not, nobody ever did, but as well as he\ncould make out, it was over. Over for the day? we asked him. No, he\nsaid, over for good.\n\nOver for good!\n\nWhen we heard this unaccountable answer, we looked at one another\nquite lost in amazement. Could it be possible that the will had set\nthings right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich?\nIt seemed too good to be true. Alas it was!\n\nOur suspense was short, for a break-up soon took place in the crowd,\nand the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot and\nbringing a quantity of bad air with them. Still they were all\nexceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a farce\nor a juggler than from a court of justice. We stood aside, watching\nfor any countenance we knew, and presently great bundles of paper\nbegan to be carried out--bundles in bags, bundles too large to be got\ninto any bags, immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes,\nwhich the bearers staggered under, and threw down for the time being,\nanyhow, on the Hall pavement, while they went back to bring out more.\nEven these clerks were laughing. We glanced at the papers, and seeing\nJarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere, asked an official-looking person\nwho was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over.\nYes, he said, it was all up with it at last, and burst out laughing\ntoo.\n\nAt this juncture we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an\naffable dignity upon him, listening to Mr. Vholes, who was\ndeferential and carried his own bag. Mr. Vholes was the first to see\nus. \"Here is Miss Summerson, sir,\" he said. \"And Mr. Woodcourt.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Yes. Truly!\" said Mr. Kenge, raising his hat to me with\npolished politeness. \"How do you do? Glad to see you. Mr. Jarndyce is\nnot here?\"\n\nNo. He never came there, I reminded him.\n\n\"Really,\" returned Mr. Kenge, \"it is as well that he is NOT here\nto-day, for his--shall I say, in my good friend's absence, his\nindomitable singularity of opinion?--might have been strengthened,\nperhaps; not reasonably, but might have been strengthened.\"\n\n\"Pray what has been done to-day?\" asked Allan.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Mr. Kenge with excessive urbanity.\n\n\"What has been done to-day?\"\n\n\"What has been done,\" repeated Mr. Kenge. \"Quite so. Yes. Why, not\nmuch has been done; not much. We have been checked--brought up\nsuddenly, I would say--upon the--shall I term it threshold?\"\n\n\"Is this will considered a genuine document, sir?\" said Allan. \"Will\nyou tell us that?\"\n\n\"Most certainly, if I could,\" said Mr. Kenge; \"but we have not gone\ninto that, we have not gone into that.\"\n\n\"We have not gone into that,\" repeated Mr. Vholes as if his low\ninward voice were an echo.\n\n\"You are to reflect, Mr. Woodcourt,\" observed Mr. Kenge, using his\nsilver trowel persuasively and smoothingly, \"that this has been a\ngreat cause, that this has been a protracted cause, that this has\nbeen a complex cause. Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been termed, not\ninaptly, a monument of Chancery practice.\"\n\n\"And patience has sat upon it a long time,\" said Allan.\n\n\"Very well indeed, sir,\" returned Mr. Kenge with a certain\ncondescending laugh he had. \"Very well! You are further to reflect,\nMr. Woodcourt,\" becoming dignified almost to severity, \"that on the\nnumerous difficulties, contingencies, masterly fictions, and forms of\nprocedure in this great cause, there has been expended study,\nability, eloquence, knowledge, intellect, Mr. Woodcourt, high\nintellect. For many years, the--a--I would say the flower of the bar,\nand the--a--I would presume to add, the matured autumnal fruits of\nthe woolsack--have been lavished upon Jarndyce and Jarndyce. If the\npublic have the benefit, and if the country have the adornment, of\nthis great grasp, it must be paid for in money or money's worth,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Kenge,\" said Allan, appearing enlightened all in a moment.\n\"Excuse me, our time presses. Do I understand that the whole estate\nis found to have been absorbed in costs?\"\n\n\"Hem! I believe so,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"Mr. Vholes, what do YOU\nsay?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" said Mr. Vholes.\n\n\"And that thus the suit lapses and melts away?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"Mr. Vholes?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Mr. Vholes.\n\n\"My dearest life,\" whispered Allan, \"this will break Richard's\nheart!\"\n\nThere was such a shock of apprehension in his face, and he knew\nRichard so perfectly, and I too had seen so much of his gradual\ndecay, that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her\nforeboding love sounded like a knell in my ears.\n\n\"In case you should be wanting Mr. C., sir,\" said Mr. Vholes, coming\nafter us, \"you'll find him in court. I left him there resting himself\na little. Good day, sir; good day, Miss Summerson.\" As he gave me\nthat slowly devouring look of his, while twisting up the strings of\nhis bag before he hastened with it after Mr. Kenge, the benignant\nshadow of whose conversational presence he seemed afraid to leave, he\ngave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of his client,\nand his black buttoned-up unwholesome figure glided away to the low\ndoor at the end of the Hall.\n\n\"My dear love,\" said Allan, \"leave to me, for a little while, the\ncharge you gave me. Go home with this intelligence and come to Ada's\nby and by!\"\n\nI would not let him take me to a coach, but entreated him to go to\nRichard without a moment's delay and leave me to do as he wished.\nHurrying home, I found my guardian and told him gradually with what\nnews I had returned. \"Little woman,\" said he, quite unmoved for\nhimself, \"to have done with the suit on any terms is a greater\nblessing than I had looked for. But my poor young cousins!\"\n\nWe talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was\npossible to do. In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to\nSymond's Inn and left me at the door. I went upstairs. When my\ndarling heard my footsteps, she came out into the small passage and\nthrew her arms round my neck, but she composed herself directly and\nsaid that Richard had asked for me several times. Allan had found him\nsitting in the corner of the court, she told me, like a stone figure.\nOn being roused, he had broken away and made as if he would have\nspoken in a fierce voice to the judge. He was stopped by his mouth\nbeing full of blood, and Allan had brought him home.\n\nHe was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in. There\nwere restoratives on the table; the room was made as airy as\npossible, and was darkened, and was very orderly and quiet. Allan\nstood behind him watching him gravely. His face appeared to me to be\nquite destitute of colour, and now that I saw him without his seeing\nme, I fully saw, for the first time, how worn away he was. But he\nlooked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day.\n\nI sat down by his side in silence. Opening his eyes by and by, he\nsaid in a weak voice, but with his old smile, \"Dame Durden, kiss me,\nmy dear!\"\n\nIt was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low\nstate cheerful and looking forward. He was happier, he said, in our\nintended marriage than he could find words to tell me. My husband had\nbeen a guardian angel to him and Ada, and he blessed us both and\nwished us all the joy that life could yield us. I almost felt as if\nmy own heart would have broken when I saw him take my husband's hand\nand hold it to his breast.\n\nWe spoke of the future as much as possible, and he said several times\nthat he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his\nfeet. Ada would contrive to take him, somehow, he said. \"Yes, surely,\ndearest Richard!\" But as my darling answered him thus hopefully, so\nserene and beautiful, with the help that was to come to her so\nnear--I knew--I knew!\n\nIt was not good for him to talk too much, and when he was silent, we\nwere silent too. Sitting beside him, I made a pretence of working for\nmy dear, as he had always been used to joke about my being busy. Ada\nleaned upon his pillow, holding his head upon her arm. He dozed\noften, and whenever he awoke without seeing him, said first of all,\n\"Where is Woodcourt?\"\n\nEvening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian\nstanding in the little hall. \"Who is that, Dame Durden?\" Richard\nasked me. The door was behind him, but he had observed in my face\nthat some one was there.\n\nI looked to Allan for advice, and as he nodded \"Yes,\" bent over\nRichard and told him. My guardian saw what passed, came softly by me\nin a moment, and laid his hand on Richard's. \"Oh, sir,\" said Richard,\n\"you are a good man, you are a good man!\" and burst into tears for\nthe first time.\n\nMy guardian, the picture of a good man, sat down in my place, keeping\nhis hand on Richard's.\n\n\"My dear Rick,\" said he, \"the clouds have cleared away, and it is\nbright now. We can see now. We were all bewildered, Rick, more or\nless. What matters! And how are you, my dear boy?\"\n\n\"I am very weak, sir, but I hope I shall be stronger. I have to begin\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Aye, truly; well said!\" cried my guardian.\n\n\"I will not begin it in the old way now,\" said Richard with a sad\nsmile. \"I have learned a lesson now, sir. It was a hard one, but you\nshall be assured, indeed, that I have learned it.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said my guardian, comforting him; \"well, well, well,\ndear boy!\"\n\n\"I was thinking, sir,\" resumed Richard, \"that there is nothing on\nearth I should so much like to see as their house--Dame Durden's and\nWoodcourt's house. If I could be removed there when I begin to\nrecover my strength, I feel as if I should get well there sooner than\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"Why, so have I been thinking too, Rick,\" said my guardian, \"and our\nlittle woman likewise; she and I have been talking of it this very\nday. I dare say her husband won't object. What do you think?\"\n\nRichard smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind\nthe head of the couch.\n\n\"I say nothing of Ada,\" said Richard, \"but I think of her, and have\nthought of her very much. Look at her! See her here, sir, bending\nover this pillow when she has so much need to rest upon it herself,\nmy dear love, my poor girl!\"\n\nHe clasped her in his arms, and none of us spoke. He gradually\nreleased her, and she looked upon us, and looked up to heaven, and\nmoved her lips.\n\n\"When I get down to Bleak House,\" said Richard, \"I shall have much to\ntell you, sir, and you will have much to show me. You will go, won't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, dear Rick.\"\n\n\"Thank you; like you, like you,\" said Richard. \"But it's all like\nyou. They have been telling me how you planned it and how you\nremembered all Esther's familiar tastes and ways. It will be like\ncoming to the old Bleak House again.\"\n\n\"And you will come there too, I hope, Rick. I am a solitary man now,\nyou know, and it will be a charity to come to me. A charity to come\nto me, my love!\" he repeated to Ada as he gently passed his hand over\nher golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips. (I think he vowed\nwithin himself to cherish her if she were left alone.)\n\n\"It was a troubled dream?\" said Richard, clasping both my guardian's\nhands eagerly.\n\n\"Nothing more, Rick; nothing more.\"\n\n\"And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity\nthe dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?\"\n\n\"Indeed I can. What am I but another dreamer, Rick?\"\n\n\"I will begin the world!\" said Richard with a light in his eyes.\n\nMy husband drew a little nearer towards Ada, and I saw him solemnly\nlift up his hand to warn my guardian.\n\n\"When shall I go from this place to that pleasant country where the\nold times are, where I shall have strength to tell what Ada has been\nto me, where I shall be able to recall my many faults and\nblindnesses, where I shall prepare myself to be a guide to my unborn\nchild?\" said Richard. \"When shall I go?\"\n\n\"Dear Rick, when you are strong enough,\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"Ada, my darling!\"\n\nHe sought to raise himself a little. Allan raised him so that she\ncould hold him on her bosom, which was what he wanted.\n\n\"I have done you many wrongs, my own. I have fallen like a poor stray\nshadow on your way, I have married you to poverty and trouble, I have\nscattered your means to the winds. You will forgive me all this, my\nAda, before I begin the world?\"\n\nA smile irradiated his face as she bent to kiss him. He slowly laid\nhis face down upon her bosom, drew his arms closer round her neck,\nand with one parting sob began the world. Not this world, oh, not\nthis! The world that sets this right.\n\nWhen all was still, at a late hour, poor crazed Miss Flite came\nweeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty.\n\n\n\n\nDown in Lincolnshire\n\n\nThere is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days, as there is\nupon a portion of the family history. The story goes that Sir\nLeicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace;\nbut it is a lame story, feebly whispering and creeping about, and any\nbrighter spark of life it shows soon dies away. It is known for\ncertain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the\npark, where the trees arch darkly overhead, and the owl is heard at\nnight making the woods ring; but whence she was brought home to be\nlaid among the echoes of that solitary place, or how she died, is all\nmystery. Some of her old friends, principally to be found among the\npeachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats, did once\noccasionally say, as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large\nfans--like charmers reduced to flirting with grim death, after losing\nall their other beaux--did once occasionally say, when the world\nassembled together, that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks,\nentombed in the mausoleum, never rose against the profanation of her\ncompany. But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have\nnever been known to object.\n\nUp from among the fern in the hollow, and winding by the bridle-road\namong the trees, comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of\nhorses' hoofs. Then may be seen Sir Leicester--invalided, bent, and\nalmost blind, but of worthy presence yet--riding with a stalwart man\nbeside him, constant to his bridle-rein. When they come to a certain\nspot before the mausoleum-door, Sir Leicester's accustomed horse\nstops of his own accord, and Sir Leicester, pulling off his hat, is\nstill for a few moments before they ride away.\n\nWar rages yet with the audacious Boythorn, though at uncertain\nintervals, and now hotly, and now coolly, flickering like an unsteady\nfire. The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to\nLincolnshire for good, Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to\nabandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would, which\nSir Leicester, conceiving to be a condescension to his illness or\nmisfortune, took in such high dudgeon, and was so magnificently\naggrieved by, that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of\ncommitting a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself.\nSimilarly, Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the\ndisputed thoroughfare and (with his bird upon his head) to hold forth\nvehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home;\nsimilarly, also, he defies him as of old in the little church by\ntestifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence. But it is\nwhispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe, he is\nreally most considerate, and that Sir Leicester, in the dignity of\nbeing implacable, little supposes how much he is humoured. As little\ndoes he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered\nin the fortunes of two sisters, and his antagonist, who knows it now,\nis not the man to tell him. So the quarrel goes on to the\nsatisfaction of both.\n\nIn one of the lodges of the park--that lodge within sight of the\nhouse where, once upon a time, when the waters were out down in\nLincolnshire, my Lady used to see the keeper's child--the stalwart\nman, the trooper formerly, is housed. Some relics of his old calling\nhang upon the walls, and these it is the chosen recreation of a\nlittle lame man about the stable-yard to keep gleaming bright. A busy\nlittle man he always is, in the polishing at harness-house doors, of\nstirrup-irons, bits, curb-chains, harness bosses, anything in the way\nof a stable-yard that will take a polish, leading a life of friction.\nA shaggy little damaged man, withal, not unlike an old dog of some\nmongrel breed, who has been considerably knocked about. He answers to\nthe name of Phil.\n\nA goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper (harder of\nhearing now) going to church on the arm of her son and to\nobserve--which few do, for the house is scant of company in these\ntimes--the relations of both towards Sir Leicester, and his towards\nthem. They have visitors in the high summer weather, when a grey\ncloak and umbrella, unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods, are\nseen among the leaves; when two young ladies are occasionally found\ngambolling in sequestered saw-pits and such nooks of the park; and\nwhen the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening\nair from the trooper's door. Then is a fife heard trolling within the\nlodge on the inspiring topic of the \"British Grenadiers\"; and as the\nevening closes in, a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say, while\ntwo men pace together up and down, \"But I never own to it before the\nold girl. Discipline must be maintained.\"\n\nThe greater part of the house is shut up, and it is a show-house no\nlonger; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long\ndrawing-room for all that, and reposes in his old place before my\nLady's picture. Closed in by night with broad screens, and illumined\nonly in that part, the light of the drawing-room seems gradually\ncontracting and dwindling until it shall be no more. A little more,\nin truth, and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester; and the\ndamp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight, and looks so\nobdurate, will have opened and received him.\n\nVolumnia, growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her\nface, and yellower as to the white, reads to Sir Leicester in the\nlong evenings and is driven to various artifices to conceal her\nyawns, of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of\nthe pearl necklace between her rosy lips. Long-winded treatises on\nthe Buffy and Boodle question, showing how Buffy is immaculate and\nBoodle villainous, and how the country is lost by being all Boodle\nand no Buffy, or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle (it must be\none of the two, and cannot be anything else), are the staple of her\nreading. Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not\nappear to follow it very closely, further than that he always comes\nbroad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off, and sonorously\nrepeating her last words, begs with some displeasure to know if she\nfinds herself fatigued. However, Volumnia, in the course of her\nbird-like hopping about and pecking at papers, has alighted on a\nmemorandum concerning herself in the event of \"anything happening\" to\nher kinsman, which is handsome compensation for an extensive course\nof reading and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay.\n\nThe cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dullness,\nbut take to it a little in the shooting season, when guns are heard\nin the plantations, and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at\nthe old places of appointment for low-spirited twos and threes of\ncousins. The debilitated cousin, more debilitated by the dreariness\nof the place, gets into a fearful state of depression, groaning under\npenitential sofa-pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that\nsuch fernal old jail's--nough t'sew fler up--frever.\n\nThe only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the\nplace in Lincolnshire are those occasions, rare and widely separated,\nwhen something is to be done for the county or the country in the way\nof gracing a public ball. Then, indeed, does the tuckered sylph come\nout in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the\nexhausted old assembly-room, fourteen heavy miles off, which, during\nthree hundred and sixty-four days and nights of every ordinary year,\nis a kind of antipodean lumber-room full of old chairs and tables\nupside down. Then, indeed, does she captivate all hearts by her\ncondescension, by her girlish vivacity, and by her skipping about as\nin the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of\nteeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each. Then does she\ntwirl and twine, a pastoral nymph of good family, through the mazes\nof the dance. Then do the swains appear with tea, with lemonade, with\nsandwiches, with homage. Then is she kind and cruel, stately and\nunassuming, various, beautifully wilful. Then is there a singular\nkind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of\nanother age embellishing that assembly-room, which, with their meagre\nstems, their spare little drops, their disappointing knobs where no\ndrops are, their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have\nboth departed, and their little feeble prismatic twinkling, all seem\nVolumnias.\n\nFor the rest, Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of\novergrown house looking out upon trees, sighing, wringing their\nhands, bowing their heads, and casting their tears upon the\nwindow-panes in monotonous depressions. A labyrinth of grandeur, less\nthe property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly\nlikenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which\nstart out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding\nthrough the building. A waste of unused passages and staircases in\nwhich to drop a comb upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a\nstealthy footfall on an errand through the house. A place where few\npeople care to go about alone, where a maid screams if an ash drops\nfrom the fire, takes to crying at all times and seasons, becomes the\nvictim of a low disorder of the spirits, and gives warning and\ndeparts.\n\nThus Chesney Wold. With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and\nvacancy; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry\nlowering; so sombre and motionless always--no flag flying now by day,\nno rows of lights sparkling by night; with no family to come and go,\nno visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms, no stir of\nlife about it--passion and pride, even to the stranger's eye, have\ndied away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull\nrepose.\n\n\n\n\nThe Close of Esther's Narrative\n\n\nFull seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House. The\nfew words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned;\nthen I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever. Not\nwithout much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope,\non his or hers.\n\nThey gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never\nleft her. The little child who was to have done so much was born\nbefore the turf was planted on its father's grave. It was a boy; and\nI, my husband, and my guardian gave him his father's name.\n\nThe help that my dear counted on did come to her, though it came, in\nthe eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore\nhis mother, not his father, was the errand of this baby, its power\nwas mighty to do it. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand\nand how its touch could heal my darling's heart and raised hope\nwithin her, I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of\nGod.\n\nThey throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country\ngarden and walk there with her infant in her arms. I was married\nthen. I was the happiest of the happy.\n\nIt was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she\nwould come home.\n\n\"Both houses are your home, my dear,\" said he, \"but the older Bleak\nHouse claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do\nit, come and take possession of your home.\"\n\nAda called him \"her dearest cousin, John.\" But he said, no, it must\nbe guardian now. He was her guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and\nhe had an old association with the name. So she called him guardian,\nand has called him guardian ever since. The children know him by no\nother name. I say the children; I have two little daughters.\n\nIt is difficult to believe that Charley (round-eyed still, and not at\nall grammatical) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so\nit is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write early in the\nmorning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go\nround. I hope the miller will not spoil Charley; but he is very fond\nof her, and Charley is rather vain of such a match, for he is well to\ndo and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I\nmight suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill\ndid half an hour ago, since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly\nwhat Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really\nafraid to say what he did at school in ciphering, but I think it was\ndecimals. He is apprenticed to the miller, whatever it was, and is a\ngood bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody and being\nashamed of it.\n\nCaddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer\ncreature than ever, perpetually dancing in and out of the house with\nthe children as if she had never given a dancing-lesson in her life.\nCaddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and\nlives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. She works\nvery hard, her husband (an excellent one) being lame and able to do\nvery little. Still, she is more than contented and does all she has\nto do with all her heart. Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new\nhouse with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one.\nI have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great\nmortification from her daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits, but\nI hope she got over it in time. She has been disappointed in\nBorrioboola-Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the\nking of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody--who survived the\nclimate--for rum, but she has taken up with the rights of women to\nsit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more\ncorrespondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor\nlittle girl. She is not such a mite now, but she is deaf and dumb. I\nbelieve there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in\nher scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts to\nsoften the affliction of her child.\n\nAs if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of\nPeepy and old Mr. Turveydrop.

He is constant in his patronage of\nPeepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French\nclock in his dressing-room--which is not his property.\n\nWith the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house\nby throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we\ninaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see\nus. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in\ndrawing to an end, but when I write of him, my tears will have their\nway.\n\nI never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a\ngood man. To Ada and her pretty boy, he is the fondest father; to me\nhe is what he has ever been, and what name can I give to that? He is\nmy husband's best and dearest friend, he is our children's darling,\nhe is the object of our deepest love and veneration. Yet while I feel\ntowards him as if he were a superior being, I am so familiar with him\nand so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself.

I\nremarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now, and\nhe said, no, truly; it had finally departed from that quarter on that\nvery day.\n\nI think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever. The sorrow that\nhas been in her face--for it is not there now--seems to have purified\neven its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality.\nSometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that\nshe still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel--it is difficult to\nexpress--as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear\nEsther in her prayers.\n\nI call him my Richard! But he says that he has two mamas, and I am\none.\n\nWe are not rich in the bank, but we have always prospered, and we\nhave quite enough. I never walk out with my husband but I hear the\npeople bless him. I never go into a house of any degree but I hear\nhis praises or see them in grateful eyes. I never lie down at night\nbut I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and\nsoothed some fellow-creature in the time of need. I know that from\nthe beds of those who were past recovery, thanks have often, often\ngone up, in the last hour, for his patient ministration. Is not this\nto be rich?\n\nThe people even praise me as the doctor's wife. The people even like\nme as I go about, and make so much of me that I am quite abashed. I\nowe it all to him, my love, my pride! They like me for his sake, as I\ndo everything I do in life for his sake.\n\nA night or two ago, after bustling about preparing for my darling and\nmy guardian and little Richard, who are coming to-morrow, I was\nsitting out in the porch of all places, that dearly memorable porch,\nwhen Allan came home. So he said, \"My precious little woman, what are\nyou doing here?\" And I said, \"The moon is shining so brightly, Allan,\nand the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here\nthinking.\"\n\n\"What have you been thinking about, my dear?\" said Allan then.\n\n\"How curious you are!\" said I. \"I am almost ashamed to tell you, but\nI will. I have been thinking about my old looks--such as they were.\"\n\n\"And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?\" said\nAllan.\n\n\"I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you COULD\nhave loved me any better, even if I had retained them.\"\n\n\"'Such as they were'?\" said Allan, laughing.\n\n\"Such as they were, of course.\"\n\n\"My dear Dame Durden,\" said Allan, drawing my arm through his, \"do\nyou ever look in the glass?\"\n\n\"You know I do; you see me do it.\"\n\n\"And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?\"\n\n\"I did not know that; I am not certain that I know it now.

He knows that she will be happier as Allan's wife than she would be as his. Esther is dumbfounded. Allan accepts Jarndyce's offer of Esther's hand, and Esther agrees. Esther passes from being the mistress of one Bleak House, to being mistress of the new one. Mr. Guppy, back at the St Alban's Bleak House, still pursues Esther.

Jarndyce, Ada, Woodcourt, and Allan all live happily ever after.","summary_analysis":"Dicken's bright and happy ending is only marred by the death of Richard .  The fact that none of the surviving main characters are interested with documents or suits or \"signs and tokens\" ensures their happiness.  The feelings is that most of the people who have lived through this novel have gotten their just desserts.  Only Jenny the brickmaker's wife is left out of the winding up. The surprising happy ending of Sir Leicester is perhaps the least expected of the bunch.  Also, Esther's wish that Jarndyce not marry anyone else is fulfiled, and Jarndyce remains the foster father\/Guardian of Ada and Esther. This novel has so many parallels between characters that sometimes multiple ones can be drawn.  The Skimpole\/Turveydrop characters of superficiality, the Jenny\/Lady Dedlock polar opposites, the high and low extremes of Sir Leicester and Jo the Crossing Sweeper are only a few.  Dickens delighted in repeating his ideas in different characters, as well as injecting wholly unique ones, like Inspector Bucket, into the mix. To some critics, the ending of Esther with Woodcourt seems a bit saccharine.  That a destitute young woman who depended soley on her Guardian for her support would hesitate to marry him has been criticized as anti-intuitive, especially regarding Esther's commitment to duty.  Also, Ada's misguided love of Richard, and her ineffectuality at saving him, has been put forward as proof that Dickens didn't have much respect for women's powers of persuasion. But the domestic bliss that intermittently pops up, and, ultimately triumphs in the end of Bleak House has the marks of authenticity to it.  Dickens really did believe that it was the most important state, and considered it far more important than any institution of his day.  This novel clearly illustrates his belief, and does a very good job of convincing the reader of it, too.","summary_length":514.0,"analysis_length":315.0,"chap_int":67,"previous summary id":["chapter 66","chapters 65-66","chapter 66","chapter 66"],"previous chapter":["Well, Sir Dedlock is back at Chesney Wold, but not totally recovered.

The\nfew words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned;\nthen I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever. Not\nwithout much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope,\non his or hers.\n\nThey gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never\nleft her. The little child who was to have done so much was born\nbefore the turf was planted on its father's grave. It was a boy; and\nI, my husband, and my guardian gave him his father's name.\n\nThe help that my dear counted on did come to her, though it came, in\nthe eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore\nhis mother, not his father, was the errand of this baby, its power\nwas mighty to do it. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand\nand how its touch could heal my darling's heart and raised hope\nwithin her, I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of\nGod.\n\nThey throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country\ngarden and walk there with her infant in her arms. I was married\nthen. I was the happiest of the happy.\n\nIt was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she\nwould come home.\n\n\"Both houses are your home, my dear,\" said he, \"but the older Bleak\nHouse claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do\nit, come and take possession of your home.\"\n\nAda called him \"her dearest cousin, John.\" But he said, no, it must\nbe guardian now. He was her guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and\nhe had an old association with the name. So she called him guardian,\nand has called him guardian ever since. The children know him by no\nother name. I say the children; I have two little daughters.\n\nIt is difficult to believe that Charley (round-eyed still, and not at\nall grammatical) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so\nit is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write early in the\nmorning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go\nround. I hope the miller will not spoil Charley; but he is very fond\nof her, and Charley is rather vain of such a match, for he is well to\ndo and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I\nmight suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill\ndid half an hour ago, since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly\nwhat Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really\nafraid to say what he did at school in ciphering, but I think it was\ndecimals. He is apprenticed to the miller, whatever it was, and is a\ngood bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody and being\nashamed of it.\n\nCaddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer\ncreature than ever, perpetually dancing in and out of the house with\nthe children as if she had never given a dancing-lesson in her life.\nCaddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and\nlives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. She works\nvery hard, her husband (an excellent one) being lame and able to do\nvery little. Still, she is more than contented and does all she has\nto do with all her heart. Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new\nhouse with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one.\nI have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great\nmortification from her daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits, but\nI hope she got over it in time. She has been disappointed in\nBorrioboola-Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the\nking of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody--who survived the\nclimate--for rum, but she has taken up with the rights of women to\nsit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more\ncorrespondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor\nlittle girl. She is not such a mite now, but she is deaf and dumb. I\nbelieve there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in\nher scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts to\nsoften the affliction of her child.\n\nAs if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of\nPeepy and old Mr. Turveydrop. Peepy is in the Custom House, and doing\nextremely well. Old Mr. Turveydrop, very apoplectic, still exhibits\nhis deportment about town, still enjoys himself in the old manner, is\nstill believed in in the old way. He is constant in his patronage of\nPeepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French\nclock in his dressing-room--which is not his property.\n\nWith the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house\nby throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we\ninaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see\nus.

The\nfew words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned;\nthen I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever. Not\nwithout much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope,\non his or hers.\n\nThey gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never\nleft her. The little child who was to have done so much was born\nbefore the turf was planted on its father's grave. It was a boy; and\nI, my husband, and my guardian gave him his father's name.\n\nThe help that my dear counted on did come to her, though it came, in\nthe eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore\nhis mother, not his father, was the errand of this baby, its power\nwas mighty to do it. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand\nand how its touch could heal my darling's heart and raised hope\nwithin her, I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of\nGod.\n\nThey throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country\ngarden and walk there with her infant in her arms. I was married\nthen. I was the happiest of the happy.\n\nIt was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she\nwould come home.\n\n\"Both houses are your home, my dear,\" said he, \"but the older Bleak\nHouse claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do\nit, come and take possession of your home.\"\n\nAda called him \"her dearest cousin, John.\" But he said, no, it must\nbe guardian now. He was her guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and\nhe had an old association with the name. So she called him guardian,\nand has called him guardian ever since. The children know him by no\nother name. I say the children; I have two little daughters.\n\nIt is difficult to believe that Charley (round-eyed still, and not at\nall grammatical) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so\nit is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write early in the\nmorning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go\nround. I hope the miller will not spoil Charley; but he is very fond\nof her, and Charley is rather vain of such a match, for he is well to\ndo and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I\nmight suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill\ndid half an hour ago, since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly\nwhat Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really\nafraid to say what he did at school in ciphering, but I think it was\ndecimals. He is apprenticed to the miller, whatever it was, and is a\ngood bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody and being\nashamed of it.\n\nCaddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer\ncreature than ever, perpetually dancing in and out of the house with\nthe children as if she had never given a dancing-lesson in her life.\nCaddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and\nlives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. She works\nvery hard, her husband (an excellent one) being lame and able to do\nvery little. Still, she is more than contented and does all she has\nto do with all her heart. Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new\nhouse with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one.\nI have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great\nmortification from her daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits, but\nI hope she got over it in time. She has been disappointed in\nBorrioboola-Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the\nking of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody--who survived the\nclimate--for rum, but she has taken up with the rights of women to\nsit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more\ncorrespondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor\nlittle girl. She is not such a mite now, but she is deaf and dumb. I\nbelieve there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in\nher scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts to\nsoften the affliction of her child.\n\nAs if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of\nPeepy and old Mr. Turveydrop. Peepy is in the Custom House, and doing\nextremely well. Old Mr. Turveydrop, very apoplectic, still exhibits\nhis deportment about town, still enjoys himself in the old manner, is\nstill believed in in the old way. He is constant in his patronage of\nPeepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French\nclock in his dressing-room--which is not his property.\n\nWith the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house\nby throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we\ninaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see\nus. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in\ndrawing to an end, but when I write of him, my tears will have their\nway.\n\nI never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a\ngood man. To Ada and her pretty boy, he is the fondest father; to me\nhe is what he has ever been, and what name can I give to that? He is\nmy husband's best and dearest friend, he is our children's darling,\nhe is the object of our deepest love and veneration. Yet while I feel\ntowards him as if he were a superior being, I am so familiar with him\nand so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself. I have never\nlost my old names, nor has he lost his; nor do I ever, when he is\nwith us, sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side,\nDame Trot, Dame Durden, Little Woman--all just the same as ever; and\nI answer, \"Yes, dear guardian!\" just the same.\n\nI have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment\nsince the day when he took me to the porch to read the name. I\nremarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now, and\nhe said, no, truly; it had finally departed from that quarter on that\nvery day.\n\nI think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever. The sorrow that\nhas been in her face--for it is not there now--seems to have purified\neven its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality.\nSometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that\nshe still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel--it is difficult to\nexpress--as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear\nEsther in her prayers.\n\nI call him my Richard! But he says that he has two mamas, and I am\none.\n\nWe are not rich in the bank, but we have always prospered, and we\nhave quite enough. I never walk out with my husband but I hear the\npeople bless him. I never go into a house of any degree but I hear\nhis praises or see them in grateful eyes. I never lie down at night\nbut I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and\nsoothed some fellow-creature in the time of need. I know that from\nthe beds of those who were past recovery, thanks have often, often\ngone up, in the last hour, for his patient ministration. Is not this\nto be rich?\n\nThe people even praise me as the doctor's wife. The people even like\nme as I go about, and make so much of me that I am quite abashed. I\nowe it all to him, my love, my pride! They like me for his sake, as I\ndo everything I do in life for his sake.\n\nA night or two ago, after bustling about preparing for my darling and\nmy guardian and little Richard, who are coming to-morrow, I was\nsitting out in the porch of all places, that dearly memorable porch,\nwhen Allan came home. So he said, \"My precious little woman, what are\nyou doing here?\" And I said, \"The moon is shining so brightly, Allan,\nand the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here\nthinking.\"\n\n\"What have you been thinking about, my dear?\" said Allan then.\n\n\"How curious you are!\" said I. \"I am almost ashamed to tell you, but\nI will. I have been thinking about my old looks--such as they were.\"\n\n\"And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?\" said\nAllan.\n\n\"I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you COULD\nhave loved me any better, even if I had retained them.\"\n\n\"'Such as they were'?\" said Allan, laughing.\n\n\"Such as they were, of course.\"\n\n\"My dear Dame Durden,\" said Allan, drawing my arm through his, \"do\nyou ever look in the glass?\"\n\n\"You know I do; you see me do it.\"\n\n\"And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?\"\n\n\"I did not know that; I am not certain that I know it now. But I know\nthat my dearest little pets are very pretty, and that my darling is\nvery beautiful, and that my husband is very handsome, and that my\nguardian has the brightest and most benevolent face that ever was\nseen, and that they can very well do without much beauty in me--even\nsupposing--.\"\n\n\n","chapter_length":1530.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 67","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201101003913\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/b\/bleak-house\/summary-and-analysis\/chapter-67","summary_text":"For \"full seven happy years,\" Esther has been the mistress of the new Bleak House.

Esther says that recently she looked in the mirror and told Woodcourt she couldn't imagine him loving her any more than he does, even if she were still beautiful. He says she is more beautiful than ever. She says she isn't sure of this, but that everyone around her is beautiful. She ends her story in the middle of a sentence, beginning to speculate on something that she never articulates\", \"analysis\": \"The insidious, endlessly droning Chancery suit comes to a somewhat abrupt ending in chapter 65, rendering even more absurd the generations of people who have sacrificed their lives for it. Just like that, Jarndyce and Jarndyce ends in its ridiculous, anticlimactic way, but it claims one final victim before dissolving. Strangely, Richard dies immediately after the suit ends, as though the suit had been his lifeblood or as if he and the lawsuit had been one and the same. Indeed, the abundance of cannibalistic images of Mr. Vholes suggests that the suit and Richard existed in a kind of reciprocal life-giving relationship. Once the final will is discovered, both the suit and Richard dissolve. Dickens concludes the novel shortly after the suit ends, suggesting that the Jarndyce and Jarndyce suit serves as a kind of structural backbone to the story. Esther's happy conclusion stands in stark contrast to the dismal conclusion of the narrator's portion of the novel, in which he describes hollow, creepy Chesney Wold and the eclectic collection of people who populate it. Whereas the two Bleak Houses are lively, full of children, friends, and love, Chesney Wold is so desolate that people are afraid to walk through its rooms alone. While the two Bleak Houses restore happiness to the grieving Ada, Chesney Wold drives a maid to depression and, eventually, sudden departure. Even the people themselves in each world fall on vastly different sides of the divide between life and death. The Bleak Houses shelter those who are young and robust, while Chesney Wold contains more than its share of the infirm. There is Sir Leicester, who never fully recovered from his ailments; Phil, the crippled former soldier; Boythorn, nearby, with his eternally broken heart; Volumnia, fading from her coquettish glory; and, occasionally, a collection of dispirited cousins. Only Mrs. Rouncewell and George seem to hold much peace or vibrant energy. A true path of victims concludes the novel, a result of the narrative drive to reach the conclusion of Bleak House. Even though Richard's death darkens the final portions of Bleak House, Esther's narrative ends rather happily with a wedding and a birth among Esther's close, nurturing circle. A series of surprises brings Esther and Woodcourt together and reveals that people have been conspiring behind Esther's back to ensure her happiness. While the transition of Mr. Jarndyce from guardian\/father to intended husband and back to guardian\/father may make modern readers a bit queasy, the notions of loyalty, steadfastness, and devotion are the only issues at play here. Ada gives birth to a son, who revives his mother in the way Ada hoped he would revive Richard. Along with Esther's two daughters, the baby boy, named Richard, form a trio that mirrors the trio of Esther, Ada, and Richard, who arrived at Bleak House so long ago. The new Bleak House is, in a sense, an offspring as well. The \\\"birth\\\" of this new Bleak House and the births of children who inhabit both houses provide a sense of renewal and new beginnings after hundreds of pages filled with so much despair.\"}","chapter":"\nThe Close of Esther's Narrative\n\n\nFull seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House.

Just like that, Jarndyce and Jarndyce ends in its ridiculous, anticlimactic way, but it claims one final victim before dissolving. Strangely, Richard dies immediately after the suit ends, as though the suit had been his lifeblood or as if he and the lawsuit had been one and the same. Indeed, the abundance of cannibalistic images of Mr. Vholes suggests that the suit and Richard existed in a kind of reciprocal life-giving relationship. Once the final will is discovered, both the suit and Richard dissolve. Dickens concludes the novel shortly after the suit ends, suggesting that the Jarndyce and Jarndyce suit serves as a kind of structural backbone to the story. Esther's happy conclusion stands in stark contrast to the dismal conclusion of the narrator's portion of the novel, in which he describes hollow, creepy Chesney Wold and the eclectic collection of people who populate it. Whereas the two Bleak Houses are lively, full of children, friends, and love, Chesney Wold is so desolate that people are afraid to walk through its rooms alone. While the two Bleak Houses restore happiness to the grieving Ada, Chesney Wold drives a maid to depression and, eventually, sudden departure. Even the people themselves in each world fall on vastly different sides of the divide between life and death. The Bleak Houses shelter those who are young and robust, while Chesney Wold contains more than its share of the infirm. There is Sir Leicester, who never fully recovered from his ailments; Phil, the crippled former soldier; Boythorn, nearby, with his eternally broken heart; Volumnia, fading from her coquettish glory; and, occasionally, a collection of dispirited cousins. Only Mrs. Rouncewell and George seem to hold much peace or vibrant energy. A true path of victims concludes the novel, a result of the narrative drive to reach the conclusion of Bleak House. Even though Richard's death darkens the final portions of Bleak House, Esther's narrative ends rather happily with a wedding and a birth among Esther's close, nurturing circle. A series of surprises brings Esther and Woodcourt together and reveals that people have been conspiring behind Esther's back to ensure her happiness. While the transition of Mr. Jarndyce from guardian\/father to intended husband and back to guardian\/father may make modern readers a bit queasy, the notions of loyalty, steadfastness, and devotion are the only issues at play here. Ada gives birth to a son, who revives his mother in the way Ada hoped he would revive Richard. Along with Esther's two daughters, the baby boy, named Richard, form a trio that mirrors the trio of Esther, Ada, and Richard, who arrived at Bleak House so long ago. The new Bleak House is, in a sense, an offspring as well. The \"birth\" of this new Bleak House and the births of children who inhabit both houses provide a sense of renewal and new beginnings after hundreds of pages filled with so much despair.","summary_length":213.0,"analysis_length":515.0,"chap_int":67,"previous summary id":["chapter 66","chapters 65-66","chapter 66","chapter 66"],"previous chapter":["Well, Sir Dedlock is back at Chesney Wold, but not totally recovered.

The\nfew words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned;\nthen I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever. Not\nwithout much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope,\non his or hers.\n\nThey gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never\nleft her. The little child who was to have done so much was born\nbefore the turf was planted on its father's grave. It was a boy; and\nI, my husband, and my guardian gave him his father's name.\n\nThe help that my dear counted on did come to her, though it came, in\nthe eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore\nhis mother, not his father, was the errand of this baby, its power\nwas mighty to do it. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand\nand how its touch could heal my darling's heart and raised hope\nwithin her, I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of\nGod.\n\nThey throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country\ngarden and walk there with her infant in her arms. I was married\nthen. I was the happiest of the happy.\n\nIt was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she\nwould come home.\n\n\"Both houses are your home, my dear,\" said he, \"but the older Bleak\nHouse claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do\nit, come and take possession of your home.\"\n\nAda called him \"her dearest cousin, John.\" But he said, no, it must\nbe guardian now. He was her guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and\nhe had an old association with the name. So she called him guardian,\nand has called him guardian ever since. The children know him by no\nother name. I say the children; I have two little daughters.\n\nIt is difficult to believe that Charley (round-eyed still, and not at\nall grammatical) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so\nit is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write early in the\nmorning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go\nround. I hope the miller will not spoil Charley; but he is very fond\nof her, and Charley is rather vain of such a match, for he is well to\ndo and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I\nmight suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill\ndid half an hour ago, since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly\nwhat Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really\nafraid to say what he did at school in ciphering, but I think it was\ndecimals. He is apprenticed to the miller, whatever it was, and is a\ngood bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody and being\nashamed of it.\n\nCaddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer\ncreature than ever, perpetually dancing in and out of the house with\nthe children as if she had never given a dancing-lesson in her life.\nCaddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and\nlives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. She works\nvery hard, her husband (an excellent one) being lame and able to do\nvery little. Still, she is more than contented and does all she has\nto do with all her heart. Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new\nhouse with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one.\nI have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great\nmortification from her daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits, but\nI hope she got over it in time. She has been disappointed in\nBorrioboola-Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the\nking of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody--who survived the\nclimate--for rum, but she has taken up with the rights of women to\nsit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more\ncorrespondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor\nlittle girl. She is not such a mite now, but she is deaf and dumb. I\nbelieve there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in\nher scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts to\nsoften the affliction of her child.\n\nAs if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of\nPeepy and old Mr. Turveydrop. Peepy is in the Custom House, and doing\nextremely well. Old Mr. Turveydrop, very apoplectic, still exhibits\nhis deportment about town, still enjoys himself in the old manner, is\nstill believed in in the old way. He is constant in his patronage of\nPeepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French\nclock in his dressing-room--which is not his property.\n\nWith the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house\nby throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we\ninaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see\nus. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in\ndrawing to an end, but when I write of him, my tears will have their\nway.\n\nI never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a\ngood man. To Ada and her pretty boy, he is the fondest father; to me\nhe is what he has ever been, and what name can I give to that? He is\nmy husband's best and dearest friend, he is our children's darling,\nhe is the object of our deepest love and veneration. Yet while I feel\ntowards him as if he were a superior being, I am so familiar with him\nand so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself. I have never\nlost my old names, nor has he lost his; nor do I ever, when he is\nwith us, sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side,\nDame Trot, Dame Durden, Little Woman--all just the same as ever; and\nI answer, \"Yes, dear guardian!\" just the same.\n\nI have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment\nsince the day when he took me to the porch to read the name. I\nremarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now, and\nhe said, no, truly; it had finally departed from that quarter on that\nvery day.\n\nI think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever. The sorrow that\nhas been in her face--for it is not there now--seems to have purified\neven its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality.\nSometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that\nshe still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel--it is difficult to\nexpress--as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear\nEsther in her prayers.\n\nI call him my Richard! But he says that he has two mamas, and I am\none.\n\nWe are not rich in the bank, but we have always prospered, and we\nhave quite enough. I never walk out with my husband but I hear the\npeople bless him. I never go into a house of any degree but I hear\nhis praises or see them in grateful eyes. I never lie down at night\nbut I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and\nsoothed some fellow-creature in the time of need. I know that from\nthe beds of those who were past recovery, thanks have often, often\ngone up, in the last hour, for his patient ministration. Is not this\nto be rich?\n\nThe people even praise me as the doctor's wife. The people even like\nme as I go about, and make so much of me that I am quite abashed. I\nowe it all to him, my love, my pride! They like me for his sake, as I\ndo everything I do in life for his sake.\n\nA night or two ago, after bustling about preparing for my darling and\nmy guardian and little Richard, who are coming to-morrow, I was\nsitting out in the porch of all places, that dearly memorable porch,\nwhen Allan came home. So he said, \"My precious little woman, what are\nyou doing here?\" And I said, \"The moon is shining so brightly, Allan,\nand the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here\nthinking.\"\n\n\"What have you been thinking about, my dear?\" said Allan then.\n\n\"How curious you are!\" said I. \"I am almost ashamed to tell you, but\nI will.

Instead of allowing Huck to come along, the doctor makes Huck tell him where the raft is and takes the canoe out alone to find Tom and Jim. Huck falls asleep on a woodpile while waiting for him to return. When he wakes up, he is told the doctor has not yet returned. Huck soon sees Silas, who is very glad Huck is not hurt. Together, they go to the post office, and Silas asks where Sid is. Huck makes up a story about Sid taking off to gather news about the events of the night. When they return home, Aunt Sally makes a fuss over Huck, but is glad he has returned. A large gathering is held at the house, and the women discuss how they think Jim must have been crazy due to Jim's grindstone inscriptions and the tools found in his hut, all of which Huck and Tom actually crafted. Aunt Sally is worried about Sid's whereabouts. Huck tells her the same tale he told Uncle Silas, but it does not set her mind at ease. During the night, Huck sneaks out several times and each time sees her sitting with a lit candle on the front porch, waiting for Sid's return. Huck feels very sorry for her and wishes he could tell her everything. Chapter 42 The next day, the doctor appears, bringing Tom on a stretcher and Jim in chains. Tom is comatose due to a fever from the bullet wound, but is still alive. Aunt Sally takes him inside and immediately starts to care for him. Tom improves rapidly and is almost completely better by the next day. Huck goes into the bedroom to sit with Tom and see how he is doing. Aunt Sally walks in as well and while both of them are sitting there, Tom wakes up. He immediately starts to tell Aunt Sally about everything the two of them did and how they managed to help Jim escape. Aunt Sally cannot believe they were creating all of the trouble around her house. When Tom hears that Jim has been recaptured he shouts at them that they cannot chain Jim up anymore. He tells them that Jim has been free ever since Miss Watson died and freed him in her will. Apparently Miss Watson was so ashamed about planning to sell Jim that she felt it best to set him free. At that moment Aunt Polly, Aunt Sally's sister, appears. Aunt Sally is so surprised that she rushes over to her sister to give her a hug. Aunt Polly proceeds to tell Aunt Sally that the boys masquerading as Tom and Sid are actually Huck and Tom. Embarrassed, the boys look quite sheepish. Aunt Polly only gets angry when she discovers that Tom has been stealing and hiding her letters. She also explains to Aunt Sally that in regards to Jim, Tom is correct. Miss Watson freed Jim in her will. Chapter 43 Tom tells Huck he had planned for them to run all the way to the mouth of the Mississippi if they had managed to escape unharmed. Jim gets a positive reception in the house because of how well he cared for Tom when he was sick. Tom, feeling slightly guilty, gives Jim forty dollars for putting up with them the entire time and for being such a good prisoner. Jim turns to Huck and tells him he was right about being a rich man one day. Huck asks about his six thousand dollars, assuming Pap managed to take it all. However, Tom explains that Pap was never seen again after Huck disappeared. Finally, Jim reveals that the man he and Huck found dead in the floating house was in fact Pap, but Jim had not wanted Huck to see him. Huck ends the novel by announcing that Aunt Sally wants to adopt him now, so he needs to start planning on heading west since he tried to be civilized once before, and did not like it.\", \"analysis\": \"There are several key facts revealed in the final chapters that influence how the reader views each character. Tom announces that Jim is free, which reveals why Tom was willing to help Huck in what Huck thought was a true crime. Since Jim was already a free man, Tom was not breaking any laws and therefore thought the entire ordeal was a great adventure. The second major revelation is that Pap is dead. Jim has known this for most of the journey, in fact since leaving Jackson's Island. However, Jim's motivation for hiding this secret from Huck is unclear. Perhaps Jim felt sorry for Huck and wanted to care for him since he was now an orphan. Or, perhaps Jim knew that if Huck found out Pap was dead, he would simply have returned to town and ended his runaway journey.  Without Huck, Jim would have had a far more difficult journey downriver as a lone black man and runaway slave. Having developed a strong understanding of Jim's character, it seems most likely that Jim was motivated by kindness, but a selfish desire for Huck's companionship might also have played a role. The ending appears to leave Huck almost exactly where he started. However, Huck has changed significantly during the course of his travels. Huck's comment that he needs to head west before they try to civilize is significant, because we know that Huck can act civilized when he needs to, as he survived well in his many extended stays at Southern family estates. In the beginning of the novel, Huck is a poor, simple, uneducated boy. However, by the conclusion of novel, Huck is a crafty, intelligent, wealthy young man who simply does not care to be a part of a boring middle-class lifestyle. Huck changes profoundly in the course of this novel, struggles with powerful moral issues, risks his life for those he cares about, and thrives in the process. In addition, the depiction of black slaves changes dramatically in the course of the novel. At first, slaves are merely background characters, carrying out chores while white characters monopolize the plot. However, this changes with the introduction of Jim, and continues to develop even when Jim leaves the plot for brief periods. Thus, the King's forced break-up of the Wilks's slave family powerfully impacts the reader, whereas before getting to know Jim, it might not have been perceived as so significant.  In addition to being a story about Huck's growth and maturation, and resulting freedom from his Pap, The Adeventures of Huckleberry Finn is also a story about Jim's journey towards freedom.  By ending the novel with Jim becoming a free man, with money to his name, Twain provides a clear social commentary about the immorality of slavery. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is Twain's literary masterpiece. To create this novel he first overcame the difficulty of writing in the first person from a young boy's perspective. The novel is also a testament to the various dialects and characteristics of the southern regions. Lastly, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a story about freedom, as it deals with physical freedom for the slaves and spiritual freedom for both Jim and Huck. Few novels have approached the success of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in combining such serious issues with Twain's characteristically delightful humor.\"}","chapter":"\n\nThe doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I\ngot him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island\nhunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found,\nand about midnight he must 'a' kicked his gun in his dreams, for it\nwent off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there\nand fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because\nwe wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks.\n\n\"Who is your folks?\" he says.\n\n\"The Phelpses, down yonder.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he says. And after a minute, he says:\n\n\"How'd you say he got shot?\"\n\n\"He had a dream,\" I says, \"and it shot him.\"\n\n\"Singular dream,\" he says.\n\nSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But\nwhen he see the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big\nenough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says:\n\n\"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy\nenough.\"\n\n\"What three?\"\n\n\"Why, me and Sid, and--and--and _the guns_; that's what I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he says.\n\nBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,\nand said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was\nall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\ntill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\ngo down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I\nsaid I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\nstarted.\n\nI struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix\nthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is?\nspos'n it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?--lay\naround there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know what\n_I'll_ do. I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to go\nany more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie\nhim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done\nwith him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let\nhim get ashore.\n\nSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\nwaked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the\ndoctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time\nor other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\nfor Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved,\nand turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's\nstomach! He says:\n\n\"Why, _Tom!_ Where you been all this time, you rascal?\"\n\n\"_I_ hain't been nowheres,\" I says, \"only just hunting for the runaway\nnigger--me and Sid.\"\n\n\"Why, where ever did you go?\" he says. \"Your aunt's been mighty\nuneasy.\"\n\n\"She needn't,\" I says, \"because we was all right. We followed the men\nand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we\nheard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and\ncrossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along\nup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\nand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\npaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to\nsee what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat\nfor us, and then we're going home.\"\n\nSo then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I\nsuspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of\nthe office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the\nold man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he\ngot done fooling around--but we would ride. I couldn't get him to let\nme stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I\nmust come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.\n\nWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and\ncried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern\nthat don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he\ncome.\n\nAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner;\nand such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the\nworst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She says:\n\n\"Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I\nb'lieve the nigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell--didn't I,\nSister Damrell?--s'I, he's crazy, s'I--them's the very words I said.\nYou all hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I. Look at\nthat-air grindstone, s'I; want to tell _me't_ any cretur 't's in his\nright mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a\ngrindstone? s'I. Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n'\nhere so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all\nthat--natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage.\nHe's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust place, it's what I\nsays in the middle, 'n' it's what I says last 'n' all the time--the\nnigger's crazy--crazy 's Nebokoodneezer, s'I.\"\n\n\"An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,\" says\nold Mrs. Damrell; \"what in the name o' goodness _could_ he ever want\nof--\"\n\n\"The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to\nSister Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself. Sh-she, look at\nthat-air rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, look at it, s'I--what\n_could_ he 'a' wanted of it, s'I. Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--\"\n\n\"But how in the nation'd they ever _git_ that grindstone _in_ there,\n_anyway?_ 'n' who dug that-air _hole?_ 'n' who--\"\n\n\"My very _words_, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin'--pass that-air sasser o'\nm'lasses, won't ye?--I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this\nminute, how _did_ they git that grindstone in there? s'I. Without\n_help,_ mind you--'thout _help! Thar's_ where 'tis. Don't tell _me,_\ns'I; there _wuz_ help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a _plenty_ help, too, s'I;\nther's ben a _dozen_ a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every\nlast nigger on this place but _I'd_ find out who done it, s'I;\nmoreover, s'I--\"\n\n\"A _dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn't 'a' done everything that's been\ndone. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've\nbeen made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for\nsix men: look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look\nat--\"\n\n\"You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower! It's jist as I was a-sayin' to\nBrer Phelps, his own self. S'e, what do _you_ think of it, Sister\nHotchkiss? s'e. Think o' what, Brer Phelps? s'I. Think o' that bed-leg\nsawed off that a way? s'e? _Think_ of it? s'I. I lay it never sawed\n_itself_ off, s'I--somebody _sawed_ it, s'I; that's my opinion, take\nit or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's\nmy opinion, s'I, 'n' if anybody k'n start a better one, s'I, let him\n_do_ it, s'I, that's all. I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I--\"\n\n\"Why, dog my cats, they must 'a' ben a house-full o' niggers in there\nevery night for four weeks to 'a' done all that work, Sister Phelps.\nLook at that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret\nAfrican writ'n done with blood! Must 'a' ben a raft uv 'm at it right\nalong, all the time, amost. Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read\nto me; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash\n'm t'll--\"\n\n\"People to _help_ him, Brother Marples! Well, I reckon you'd _think_\nso if you'd 'a' been in this house for a while back. Why, they've\nstole everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all\nthe time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and\nas for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no\ntelling how many times they _didn't_ steal that; and flour, and\ncandles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and\nmost a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico\ndress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day\n_and_ night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch\nhide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last\nminute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and\nfools us, and not only fools _us_ but the Injun Territory robbers too,\nand actuly gets _away_ with that nigger safe and sound, and that with\nsixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very\ntime! I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever _heard_ of. Why,\n_sperits_ couldn't 'a' done better and been no smarter. And I reckon\nthey must 'a' _been_ sperits--because, because, _you_ know our dogs,\nand ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got on the\n_track_ of 'm once! You explain _that_ to me if you can!--_any_ of\nyou!\"\n\n\"Well, it does beat--\"\n\n\"Laws alive, I never--\"\n\n\"So help me, I wouldn't 'a' be--\"\n\n\"_House_-thieves as well as--\"\n\n\"Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd 'a' ben afeard to _live_ in sich a--\"\n\n\"Fraid to _live!_--why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed,\nor get up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they'd\nsteal the very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a\nfluster I was in by the time midnight come last night. I hope to\ngracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family! I was\njust to that pass I didn't have no reasoning faculties no more. It\nlooks foolish enough _now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself,\nthere's my two poor boys asleep, 'way upstairs in that lonesome room,\nand I declare to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and\nlocked 'em in! I _did_. And anybody would. Because, you know, when you\nget scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and\nworse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to\ndoing all sorts o' wild things, and by and by you think to yourself,\nspos'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain't locked,\nand you--\" She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned\nher head around slow, and when her eye lit on me--I got up and took a\nwalk.\n\nSays I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that\nroom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.\nSo I done it. But I dasn't go fur, or she'd 'a' sent for me. And when\nit was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and\ntold her the noise and shooting waked up me and \"Sid,\" and the door\nwas locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the\nlightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never\nwant to try _that_ no more. And then I went on and told her all what I\ntold Uncle Silas before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe\nit was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of\nboys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could\nsee; and so, as long as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she\nbetter put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she\nhad us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done. So then\nshe kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a\nbrown-study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:\n\n\"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet! What _has_\nbecome of that boy?\"\n\nI see my chance; so I skips up and says:\n\n\"I'll run right up to town and get him,\" I says.\n\n\"No you won't,\" she says. \"You'll stay right wher' you are; _one's_\nenough to be lost at a time. If he ain't here to supper, your uncle\n'll go.\"\n\nWell, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.\n\nHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's\ntrack. Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said\nthere warn't no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'll\nsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. So she had to\nbe satisfied. But she said she'd set up for him awhile anyway, and\nkeep a light burning so he could see it.\n\nAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her\ncandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and\nlike I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and\ntalked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and\ndidn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me\nevery now and then if I reckoned he could 'a' got lost, or hurt, or\nmaybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres\nsuffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears\nwould drip down silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right,\nand would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand,\nor maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it,\nbecause it done her good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she\nwas going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and\nsays:\n\n\"The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and\nthe rod; but you'll be good, _won't_ you? And you won't go? For _my_\nsake.\"\n\nLaws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all\nintending to go; but after that I wouldn't 'a' went, not for kingdoms.\n\nBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very\nrestless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped\naround front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window\nwith her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I\ncould do something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I\nwouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I\nwaked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle\nwas most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she\nwas asleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no\ntrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not\nsaying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold,\nand not eating anything. And by and by the old man says:\n\n\"Did I give you the letter?\"\n\n\"What letter?\"\n\n\"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\"\n\n\"No, you didn't give me no letter.\"\n\n\"Well, I must 'a' forgot it.\"\n\nSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had\nlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:\n\n\"Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis.\"\n\nI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But\nbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see\nsomething. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old\ndoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind\nhim; and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that\ncome handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:\n\n\"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!\"\n\nAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,\nwhich showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,\nand says:\n\n\"He's alive, thank God! And that's enough!\" and she snatched a kiss of\nhim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering\norders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as\nher tongue could go, every jump of the way.\n\nI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the\nold doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men\nwas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to\nall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run\naway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a\nwhole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others\nsaid, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and\nhis owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled\nthem down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious\nfor to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very\nones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their\nsatisfaction out of him.\n\nThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side\nthe head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let\non to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own\nclothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this\ntime, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his\nhands, too, and both legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but\nbread and water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold\nat auction because he didn't come in a certain length of time, and\nfilled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand\nwatch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the\ndoor in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job\nand was tapering off with a kind of generl good-by cussing, and then\nthe old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:\n\n\"Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't\na bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut\nthe bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me\nto leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little\nworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let\nme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill\nme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do\nanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and\nthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says\nhe'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I\njudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was!_ and there I had\nto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.\nIt was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills,\nand of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I\ndasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame;\nand yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had\nto stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger\nthat was a better nuss or faithfuler, and yet he was risking his\nfreedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough\nhe'd been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell\nyou, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and\nkind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing\nas well there as he would 'a' done at home--better, maybe, because it\nwas so quiet; but there I _was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and\nthere I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a\nskiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting\nby the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I\nmotioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and\ntied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no\ntrouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we\nmuffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice\nand quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word\nfrom the start. He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think\nabout him.\"\n\nSomebody says:\n\n\"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.\"\n\nThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\nto that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\naccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\nheart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they\nall agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have\nsome notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised,\nright out and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.\n\nThen they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he\ncould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\nheavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but\nthey didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix\nin, but I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or\nother as soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just\nahead of me--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about\nSid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted\nnight paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.\n\nBut I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\nand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I\ndodged him.\n\nNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt\nSally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I\nfound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that\nwould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and\npale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and\nlaid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\nin, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still,\nand set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be\njoyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been\nsleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuler\nall the time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.\n\nSo we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\neyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\n\n\"Hello!--why, I'm at _home!_ How's that? Where's the raft?\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" I says.\n\n\"And _Jim?_\"\n\n\"The same,\" I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never\nnoticed, but says:\n\n\"Good! Splendid! _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?\"\n\nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:\n\n\"About what, Sid?\"\n\n\"Why, about the way the whole thing was done.\"\n\n\"What whole thing?\"\n\n\"Why, _the_ whole thing. There ain't but one; how we set the runaway\nnigger free--me and Tom.\"\n\n\"Good land! Set the run--What _is_ the child talking about! Dear,\ndear, out of his head again!\"\n\n\"_No_, I ain't out of my HEAD; I know all what I'm talking about. We\n_did_ set him free--me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we _done_\nit. And we done it elegant, too.\" He'd got a start, and she never\nchecked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip\nalong, and I see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in. \"Why, Aunty, it\ncost us a power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night,\nwhilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet,\nand the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and\ncase-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and\njust no end of things, and you can't think what work it was to make\nthe saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and\nyou can't think half the fun it was. And we had to make up the\npictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the\nrobbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into\nthe cabin, and make the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie,\nand send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket--\"\n\n\"Mercy sakes!\"\n\n\"--and load up the cabin with rats and snake's and so on, for company\nfor Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat\nthat you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come\nbefore we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us\nand let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path\nand let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in\nus, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for\nthe raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all\nby ourselves, and _wasn't_ it bully. Aunty!\"\n\n\"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was\n_you_, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble,\nand turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to\ndeath. I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out\no' you this very minute. To think, here I've been, night after night,\na--_you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the\nOld Harry out o' both o' ye!\"\n\nBut Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn't_ hold in, and\nhis tongue just _went_ it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all\nalong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and\nshe says:\n\n\"_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I\ntell you if I catch you meddling with him again--\"\n\n\"Meddling with _who_ Tom says, dropping his smile and looking\nsurprised.\n\n\"With _who?_ Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd you reckon?\"\n\nTom looks at me very grave, and says:\n\n\"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? Hasn't he got away?\"\n\n\"_Him?_\" says Aunt Sally; \"the runaway nigger? 'Deed he hasn't.\nThey've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again, on\nbread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or\nsold!\"\n\nTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening\nand shutting like gills, and sings out to me:\n\n\"They hain't no _right_ to shut him up! _Shove!_--and don't you lose a\nminute. Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur\nthat walks this earth!\"\n\n\"What _does_ the child mean?\"\n\n\"I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go,\n_I'll_ go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old\nMiss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was\ngoing to sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free\nin her will.\"\n\n\"Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was\nalready free?\"\n\n\"Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and _just_ like women! Why, I\nwanted the _adventure_ of it; and I'd 'a' waded neck-deep in blood\nto--goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!\"_\n\nIf she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as\nsweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\n\nAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and\ncried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,\nfor it was getting pretty sultry for _us_, seemed to me. And I peeped\nout, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and\nstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of\ngrinding him into the earth, you know. And then she says:\n\n\"Yes, you _better_ turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom.\"\n\n\"Oh, deary me!\" says Aunt Sally; \"_is_ he changed so? Why, that ain't\n_Tom_, it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's--why, where is Tom? He was here a minute\nago.\"\n\n\"You mean where's Huck _Finn_--that's what you mean! I reckon I hain't\nraised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I\n_see_ him. That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that\nbed, Huck Finn.\"\n\nSo I done it. But not feeling brash.\n\nAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever\nsee--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they\ntold it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he\ndidn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a\nprayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation,\nbecause the oldest man in the world couldn't 'a' understood it. So\nTom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to\nup and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took\nme for Tom Sawyer--she chipped in and says, \"Oh, go on and call me\nAunt Sally, I'm used to it now, and 'taint no need to change\"--that\nwhen Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't\nno other way, and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts\nfor him, being a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be\nperfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid,\nand made things as soft as he could for me.\n\nAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson\nsetting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone\nand took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I\ncouldn't ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how\nhe _could_ help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\n\nWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom\nand _Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\n\n\"Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that\nway without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all\nthe way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that\ncreetur's up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any\nanswer out of you about it.\"\n\n\"Why, I never heard nothing from you,\" says Aunt Sally.\n\n\"Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean\nby Sid being here.\"\n\n\"Well, I never got 'em. Sis.\"\n\nAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:\n\n\"You, Tom!\"\n\n\"Well--_what?_\" he says, kind of pettish.\n\n\"Don't you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.\"\n\n\"What letters?\"\n\n\"_Them_ letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll--\"\n\n\"They're in the trunk. There, now. And they're just the same as they\nwas when I got them out of the office. I hain't looked into them, I\nhain't touched them. But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought\nif you warn't in no hurry, I'd--\"\n\n\"Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it. And I\nwrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he--\"\n\n\"No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but _it's_ all right,\nI've got that one.\"\n\nI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe\nit was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea,\ntime of the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion\nworked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already\nfree before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the\nstart, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the\nriver on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the\nriver, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up\nhome on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and\nwrite word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them\nwaltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and\nthen he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckoned it was about\nas well the way it was.\n\nWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle\nSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse\nTom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and\ngive him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And\nwe had him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim\nforty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so\ngood, and Jim was pleased most to death and busted out, and says:\n\n\"_Dah_, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson\nIslan'? I tole you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en I\n_tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _ag'in;_ en it's\ncome true; en heah she _is!

Hadn't when I come\naway, anyhow.\"\n\nJim says, kind of solemn:\n\n\"He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck.\"\n\nI says:\n\n\"Why, Jim?\"\n\n\"Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain't comin' back no mo'.\"\n\nBut I kept at him; so at last he says:\n\n\"Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz\na man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let\nyou come in?

Instead of allowing Huck to come along, the doctor makes Huck tell him where the raft is and takes the canoe out alone to find Tom and Jim. Huck falls asleep on a woodpile while waiting for him to return. When he wakes up, he is told the doctor has not yet returned. Huck soon sees Silas, who is very glad Huck is not hurt. Together, they go to the post office, and Silas asks where Sid is. Huck makes up a story about Sid taking off to gather news about the events of the night. When they return home, Aunt Sally makes a fuss over Huck, but is glad he has returned. A large gathering is held at the house, and the women discuss how they think Jim must have been crazy due to Jim's grindstone inscriptions and the tools found in his hut, all of which Huck and Tom actually crafted. Aunt Sally is worried about Sid's whereabouts. Huck tells her the same tale he told Uncle Silas, but it does not set her mind at ease. During the night, Huck sneaks out several times and each time sees her sitting with a lit candle on the front porch, waiting for Sid's return. Huck feels very sorry for her and wishes he could tell her everything. Chapter 42 The next day, the doctor appears, bringing Tom on a stretcher and Jim in chains. Tom is comatose due to a fever from the bullet wound, but is still alive. Aunt Sally takes him inside and immediately starts to care for him. Tom improves rapidly and is almost completely better by the next day. Huck goes into the bedroom to sit with Tom and see how he is doing. Aunt Sally walks in as well and while both of them are sitting there, Tom wakes up. He immediately starts to tell Aunt Sally about everything the two of them did and how they managed to help Jim escape. Aunt Sally cannot believe they were creating all of the trouble around her house. When Tom hears that Jim has been recaptured he shouts at them that they cannot chain Jim up anymore. He tells them that Jim has been free ever since Miss Watson died and freed him in her will. Apparently Miss Watson was so ashamed about planning to sell Jim that she felt it best to set him free. At that moment Aunt Polly, Aunt Sally's sister, appears. Aunt Sally is so surprised that she rushes over to her sister to give her a hug. Aunt Polly proceeds to tell Aunt Sally that the boys masquerading as Tom and Sid are actually Huck and Tom. Embarrassed, the boys look quite sheepish. Aunt Polly only gets angry when she discovers that Tom has been stealing and hiding her letters. She also explains to Aunt Sally that in regards to Jim, Tom is correct.

Jim gets a positive reception in the house because of how well he cared for Tom when he was sick. Tom, feeling slightly guilty, gives Jim forty dollars for putting up with them the entire time and for being such a good prisoner. Jim turns to Huck and tells him he was right about being a rich man one day. Huck asks about his six thousand dollars, assuming Pap managed to take it all. However, Tom explains that Pap was never seen again after Huck disappeared. Finally, Jim reveals that the man he and Huck found dead in the floating house was in fact Pap, but Jim had not wanted Huck to see him. Huck ends the novel by announcing that Aunt Sally wants to adopt him now, so he needs to start planning on heading west since he tried to be civilized once before, and did not like it.","summary_analysis":"There are several key facts revealed in the final chapters that influence how the reader views each character. Tom announces that Jim is free, which reveals why Tom was willing to help Huck in what Huck thought was a true crime. Since Jim was already a free man, Tom was not breaking any laws and therefore thought the entire ordeal was a great adventure. The second major revelation is that Pap is dead. Jim has known this for most of the journey, in fact since leaving Jackson's Island. However, Jim's motivation for hiding this secret from Huck is unclear. Perhaps Jim felt sorry for Huck and wanted to care for him since he was now an orphan. Or, perhaps Jim knew that if Huck found out Pap was dead, he would simply have returned to town and ended his runaway journey.  Without Huck, Jim would have had a far more difficult journey downriver as a lone black man and runaway slave. Having developed a strong understanding of Jim's character, it seems most likely that Jim was motivated by kindness, but a selfish desire for Huck's companionship might also have played a role. The ending appears to leave Huck almost exactly where he started. However, Huck has changed significantly during the course of his travels. Huck's comment that he needs to head west before they try to civilize is significant, because we know that Huck can act civilized when he needs to, as he survived well in his many extended stays at Southern family estates. In the beginning of the novel, Huck is a poor, simple, uneducated boy. However, by the conclusion of novel, Huck is a crafty, intelligent, wealthy young man who simply does not care to be a part of a boring middle-class lifestyle. Huck changes profoundly in the course of this novel, struggles with powerful moral issues, risks his life for those he cares about, and thrives in the process. In addition, the depiction of black slaves changes dramatically in the course of the novel. At first, slaves are merely background characters, carrying out chores while white characters monopolize the plot. However, this changes with the introduction of Jim, and continues to develop even when Jim leaves the plot for brief periods. Thus, the King's forced break-up of the Wilks's slave family powerfully impacts the reader, whereas before getting to know Jim, it might not have been perceived as so significant.  In addition to being a story about Huck's growth and maturation, and resulting freedom from his Pap, The Adeventures of Huckleberry Finn is also a story about Jim's journey towards freedom.  By ending the novel with Jim becoming a free man, with money to his name, Twain provides a clear social commentary about the immorality of slavery. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is Twain's literary masterpiece. To create this novel he first overcame the difficulty of writing in the first person from a young boy's perspective. The novel is also a testament to the various dialects and characteristics of the southern regions. Lastly, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a story about freedom, as it deals with physical freedom for the slaves and spiritual freedom for both Jim and Huck. Few novels have approached the success of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in combining such serious issues with Twain's characteristically delightful humor.","summary_length":676.0,"analysis_length":558.0,"chap_int":43,"previous summary id":["chapter 42"],"previous chapter":["Tom does not return, and Silas's efforts to find him end in vain.

When Aunt Polly and the Phelpses hear about the assistance Jim gave the doctor in nursing Tom, they immediately unchain him, feed him, and treat him like a king.

Jim tells Huck that the dead body they found on the floating house during the flood was Pap. Huck now has nothing more to write about and is \\\"rotten glad\\\" about that, because writing a book turned out to be quite a task. He does not plan any future writings. Instead, he plans to head out west immediately because Aunt Sally is already trying to \\\"sivilize\\\" him. Huck has had quite enough of that\", \"analysis\": \"The ending of Huckleberry Finn reveals Tom to be even more callous and manipulative than we realized. The bullet in Tom's leg seems rather deserved when Tom reveals that he has known all along that Miss Watson has been dead for two months and that she freed Jim in her will. Tom's confession reveals a new depth of cruelty: he treats blacks only a little better than slaveholders do, using Jim as a plaything to indulge in a great \\\"adventure.\\\" Tom's claim that he meant to pay Jim for his troubles is surely of little consolation to anyone, and indeed, the very idea of making up for such callousness with money is deeply insulting. However, no one ever chastises Tom for his behavior. Instead, he turns the bullet--the symbol of the fine line between fun and foolishness--into a trophy, and he proposes to Huck that they go look for more adventures among the \\\"Injuns,\\\" another people ravaged and oppressed by whites. At the end of the novel, Tom seems to be beyond reform, Huck opts out of society in his desire to go to Oklahoma, and the other adults are left in compromised positions. Jim is the only character who comes out of the mess looking like a respectable adult. By helping the doctor treat Tom and shielding Huck from seeing his father's corpse, Jim yet again affirms that he is a decent human being. The Phelpses, although they immediately try to make amends for their previous treatment of Jim, still own slaves. Miss Watson, although she has done the right thing by freeing Jim, sullies her good intentions by making the action a provision of her will, something to be carried out in the future--at her death--rather than immediately. Aunt Sally smothers, Aunt Polly scolds, and everyone bumbles along. In the end, it is no wonder Huck wants to avoid further \\\"sivilizing.\\\" Possibly the most troubling aspect of the novel's close is the realization that all has been for naught. Jim has, technically, been a free man almost the entire time. All of Huck's moral crises, all the lies he has told, all the societal conventions he has broken, have been part of a great game. In a way, the knowledge of Jim's emancipation erases the novel that has come before it. Ultimately, we are left questioning the meaning of what we have read: perhaps Twain means the novel as a reminder that life is ultimately a matter of imperfect information and ambiguous situations, and that the best one can do is to follow one's head and heart. Perhaps Twain, finishing this novel twenty years after the Civil War concluded and slaves were freed, means also to say that black Americans may be free in a technical sense, but that they remain chained by a society that refuses to acknowledge their rightful and equal standing as individuals. In a sense, perhaps Tom's mistreatment of Jim is actually a boon, for it leads the other characters in the novel to acknowledge Jim as a worthy human being. In the end, Huckleberry Finn moves beyond questions of slavery, to broader questions of morality and race. Unfortunately, these questions seldom have straightforward answers, and thus the ending of the novel contains as many new problems as solutions.\"}","chapter":"\n\nThe first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea,\ntime of the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion\nworked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already\nfree before?

Huck thinks it quite possible that Pap has taken all his money by now, but Jim says that could not have happened. Jim tells Huck that the dead body they found on the floating house during the flood was Pap. Huck now has nothing more to write about and is \"rotten glad\" about that, because writing a book turned out to be quite a task. He does not plan any future writings.

Huck has had quite enough of that","summary_analysis":"The ending of Huckleberry Finn reveals Tom to be even more callous and manipulative than we realized. The bullet in Tom's leg seems rather deserved when Tom reveals that he has known all along that Miss Watson has been dead for two months and that she freed Jim in her will. Tom's confession reveals a new depth of cruelty: he treats blacks only a little better than slaveholders do, using Jim as a plaything to indulge in a great \"adventure.\" Tom's claim that he meant to pay Jim for his troubles is surely of little consolation to anyone, and indeed, the very idea of making up for such callousness with money is deeply insulting. However, no one ever chastises Tom for his behavior. Instead, he turns the bullet--the symbol of the fine line between fun and foolishness--into a trophy, and he proposes to Huck that they go look for more adventures among the \"Injuns,\" another people ravaged and oppressed by whites. At the end of the novel, Tom seems to be beyond reform, Huck opts out of society in his desire to go to Oklahoma, and the other adults are left in compromised positions. Jim is the only character who comes out of the mess looking like a respectable adult. By helping the doctor treat Tom and shielding Huck from seeing his father's corpse, Jim yet again affirms that he is a decent human being. The Phelpses, although they immediately try to make amends for their previous treatment of Jim, still own slaves. Miss Watson, although she has done the right thing by freeing Jim, sullies her good intentions by making the action a provision of her will, something to be carried out in the future--at her death--rather than immediately. Aunt Sally smothers, Aunt Polly scolds, and everyone bumbles along. In the end, it is no wonder Huck wants to avoid further \"sivilizing.\" Possibly the most troubling aspect of the novel's close is the realization that all has been for naught. Jim has, technically, been a free man almost the entire time. All of Huck's moral crises, all the lies he has told, all the societal conventions he has broken, have been part of a great game. In a way, the knowledge of Jim's emancipation erases the novel that has come before it. Ultimately, we are left questioning the meaning of what we have read: perhaps Twain means the novel as a reminder that life is ultimately a matter of imperfect information and ambiguous situations, and that the best one can do is to follow one's head and heart. Perhaps Twain, finishing this novel twenty years after the Civil War concluded and slaves were freed, means also to say that black Americans may be free in a technical sense, but that they remain chained by a society that refuses to acknowledge their rightful and equal standing as individuals. In a sense, perhaps Tom's mistreatment of Jim is actually a boon, for it leads the other characters in the novel to acknowledge Jim as a worthy human being. In the end, Huckleberry Finn moves beyond questions of slavery, to broader questions of morality and race. Unfortunately, these questions seldom have straightforward answers, and thus the ending of the novel contains as many new problems as solutions.","summary_length":261.0,"analysis_length":545.0,"chap_int":43,"previous summary id":["chapter 42"],"previous chapter":["Tom does not return, and Silas's efforts to find him end in vain.

I\nunderstood why the best in me had been my sins and my\ntransgressions; and why I had never felt guilt in my sins. I\nunderstood that centuries of chains and lashes will not kill the\nspirit of man nor the sense of truth within him.\n\nI read {+many+} books for many days. Then I called the Golden One,\nand I told her what I had read and what I had learned. She looked\nat me and the first words she spoke were:\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\nThen I said:\n\n\"My dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names.\nThere was a time when each man had a name of his own to\ndistinguish him from all other men. So let us choose our names. I\nhave read of a man who lived many thousands of years ago, and of\nall the names in these books, his is the one I wish to bear. He\ntook the light of the gods and [-he-] brought it to men, and he taught\nmen to be gods. And he suffered for his deed as all bearers of\nlight must suffer. His name was Prometheus.\"\n\n\"It shall be your name,\" said the Golden One.\n\n\"And I have read of a goddess,\" I said, \"who was the mother of\nthe earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. Let this be\nyour name, my Golden One, for you are to be the mother of a new\nkind of gods.\"\n\n\"It shall be my name,\" said the Golden One.\n\nNow I look ahead. My future is clear before me. The Saint of the\npyre had seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the\nheir of all the saints and all the martyrs who came before him\nand who died for the same cause, for the same word, no matter\nwhat name they gave to their cause and their truth.\n\nI shall live here, in my own house. I shall take my food from the\nearth by the toil of my own hands. I shall learn many secrets\nfrom my books. Through the years ahead, I shall rebuild the\nachievements of the past, and open the way to carry them further,\nthe achievements which are open to me, but closed forever to my\nbrothers, for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest [-ones-]\namong them.\n\nI have learned that [-my-] {+the+} power of the sky was known to men long\nago; they called it Electricity. It was the power that moved\ntheir greatest inventions. It lit this house with light [-which-] {+that+} came\nfrom those globes of glass on the walls. I have found the engine\nwhich produced this light. I shall learn how to repair it and how\nto make it work again. I shall learn how to use the wires which\ncarry this power. Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my\nhome, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light\nas a cobweb, more impassable [-that-] {+than+} a wall of granite; a barrier my\nbrothers will never be able to cross. For they have nothing to\nfight me with, save the brute force of their numbers. I have my\nmind.\n\nThen here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and\nnothing above me but the sun, I shall live my own truth. Gaea is\npregnant with my child.  [-Our son\nwill be raised as a man.-] He will be taught to say \"I\" and to bear\nthe pride of it. He will be taught to walk straight [-and-] on his own\nfeet. He will be taught reverence for his own spirit.\n\nWhen I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when\nmy home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day,\nfor the last time, into the cursed City of my birth. I shall call\nto me my friend who has no name save International 4-8818, and\nall those like him, Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason,\nand Solidarity [-9-6347-] {+8-6347+} who calls for help in the night, and a few\nothers. I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit\nhas not been killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of\ntheir brothers. They will follow me and I shall lead them to my\nfortress. And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my\nchosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter\nin the new history of man.\n\nThese are the {+last+} things before me. And as I stand here at the\ndoor of glory, I look behind me for the last time. I look upon\nthe history of men, which I have learned from the books, and I\nwonder. It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it was\nthe spirit of man's freedom. But what is freedom? Freedom from\nwhat? There is nothing to take a man's freedom away from him,\nsave other men. To be free, a man must be free of his brothers.\nThat is freedom. That and nothing else.\n\nAt first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their\nchains.  [-The-] {+Then+} he was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their\nchains. He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race.\nBut he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a\nman has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take\naway from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right\nof man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he\nstood on the threshold of [-the-] freedom for which the blood of the\ncenturies behind him had been spilled.\n\nBut then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his\nsavage beginning.\n\nWhat brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away\nfrom men? What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and\nsubmission? The worship of the word \"We.\"\n\nWhen men accepted that worship, the structure {+of centuries\ncollapsed about them, the structure+} whose every beam had come\nfrom the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages,\nfrom the depth of some one spirit, such [-spirit-] as {+spirit+} existed but for\nits own sake. Those men who [-survived-] {+survived-+} those eager to obey, eager\nto live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate [-them--those-]\n{+them- those+} men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they\nhad received. Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom\nperish on earth. Thus did [-men---] {+men-+} men with nothing to offer save\ntheir great [-number--\nlost-] {+numbers- lose+} the steel towers, the flying ships, the\npower wires, all the things they had not created and could never\nkeep. Perhaps, later, some men had been born with the mind and\nthe courage to recover these things which were lost; perhaps\nthese men came before the Councils of Scholars. They [-were-] answered as\nI have been [-answered---] {+answered-+} and for the same reasons.\n\nBut I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years\nof transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were\ngoing, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate. I\nwonder, for it is hard for me to conceive how men who knew the word [-\"I\"-] {+\"I,\"+}\ncould give it up and not know what they {+had+} lost. But such has been\nthe story, for I have lived in the City of the damned,\nand I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them.\n\nPerhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of\nclear sight and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word.\nWhat agony must have been theirs before that which they saw\ncoming and could not stop! Perhaps they cried out in protest and\nin warning. But men paid no heed to their warning. And they, [-these-]\n{+those+} few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their\nbanners smeared by their own blood. And they chose to perish, for\nthey knew. To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity.\n\n[-Their-]\n\n{+Theirs+} is the banner in my hand. And I wish I had the power to\ntell them that the despair of their hearts was not to be final,\nand their night was not without hope. For the battle they lost\ncan never be lost. For that which they died to save can never\nperish. Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which\nmen are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this\nearth. It may sleep, but it will awaken. It may wear chains, but\nit will break through. And man will go on. Man, not men.\n\n[-Here-]\n\n{+Here,+} on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall\nbuild our new land and our fort. And it will become as the heart\nof the earth, lost and hidden at first, but beating, beating\nlouder each day. And word of it will reach every corner of the\nearth. And the roads of the world will become as veins which will\ncarry the best of the world's blood to my threshold. And all my\nbrothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but\nthey will be impotent against me. And the day will come when I\nshall break [-all-] the chains of the earth, and raze the cities of the\nenslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where\neach man will be free to exist for his own sake.\n\nFor the coming of that day [-shall-] I {+shall+} fight, I and my sons and my\nchosen friends. For the freedom of Man. For his rights. For his\nlife. For his honor.\n\nAnd here, over the portals of my fort, I shall cut in the stone\nthe word which is to be my beacon and my banner. The word which\nwill not die, should we all perish in battle. The word which can\nnever die on this earth, for it is the heart of it and the\nmeaning and the glory.\n\nThe sacred word:\n\nEGO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":1627.0,"summary_name":"Chapter Twelve","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180312192507\/http:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/anthem\/study-guide\/summary-chapter-twelve","summary_text":"Equality 7-2521 figures out that \"I\" is the word he seeks when he reads one of the books in the house.

The collectivism implicit in the word \"We\" does nothing but cause stagnation and the sapping away of the strength of the good, the wise, and the strong. Life is nothing if every man is subject to all others. He declares himself as \"done with this creed of corruption.\" He is finished with the slavery conveyed by the word \"We.\" In its place, he substitutes the word \"I,\" which is the god that will give men control over the earth and over their own lives.","Equality 7-2521 has finally discovered the first-person singular. At last, he tells us, he's found \"the words,\" and \"the answer,\" he was looking for. He, himself, is the meaning of things. Equality 7-2521 needs no reason or \"warrant\" to be. He is his own reason for being. His own will is the only thing he needs to obey. Equality 7-2521 has realized his own happiness is his highest end. He needs no higher end to justify it, because it's the purpose of his life. He does not need to justify his life by serving others. In fact, Equality 7-2521 doesn't owe anything to anyone. If he's going to love anyone else, that person has got to earn it. The word, \"we,\" is a dangerous word, Equality 7-2521 says. Actually, it's the root of all evil. If it's made the most important word, that is. It allows the weak to steal from the strong. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is done with \"we.\" It is a monster. Now, instead, he sees the face of god. God is \"I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will.\" So opens the chapter in which Equality 7-2521 re-discovers the lost and holy word, the forbidden idea for which the Saint of the Pyre was burned at the stake. The acquisition of this knowledge fulfills the intellectual quest on which Equality 7-2521 had embarked as a 10-year-old -- the attempt to discover and understand the Unspeakable Word. He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He had wished to find a warrant for being, but now understands that he needs neither warrant nor sanction. He is the warrant and sanction of his existence. He is overcome with the emotional experience of his intellectual realization: he has a right to his own life. He is not a mere appendage of a group. He can choose his own path in life -- his own interests, his own profession, his own wife, his own home. He is a free man, able to choose his goals, and then work strenuously to achieve them. Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service. An individual is \"not a sacrifice on their altars.\" Equality 7-2521 realizes, after studying the books of the Unmentionable Times, what the proper relation is between individuals. He owes no unchosen obligations to his brothers and sisters, nor do they owe him such. He states that he is neither a friend nor a foe to others, \"but such as each of them shall deserve.\" Love, he claims, must be earned -- and that requires more than the sheer fact of being born; it requires the attainment of virtue. Equality 7-2521 will choose friends from among his fellow humans, but neither masters nor servants. He says that he will love and respect his friends, but neither command nor obey them. And when humans come together in friendship and in love, they will join hands only beyond each one's \"holy threshold,\" and each will respect the personal boundaries of the other. Looking back on his past life in the city -- and thinking sorrowfully of those innocent people still trapped there -- he realizes that the horrors of his former society are the result of destroying the personal boundaries that each individual properly claims as their own. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is forever done with the code of \"we,\" with this creed of evil and destruction. He sees clearly the beneficent consequences that can result -- as they did in the past -- when society recognizes the sacred rights of individuals to mind, soul, values, and life. He observes the face of a god, the god sought by humans since the inception of the world, the god who will grant joy and peace and pride. \"This god, this one word: I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will. Equality 7-2521 realizes the meaning of the word \"I\" and realizes what has been missing from his world. He writes about standing at the summit of a mountain and concludes that he has reached the end of his quest to find the meaning of things because he is the meaning of things. His eyes' seeing makes the earth beautiful, and his ears' hearing makes the earth sing. His mind's searching gives the earth truth. His will is the only command he respects or should respect. In his new view, the only three holy words are \"I will it. Equality 7-2521 realizes that the goal of his existence, no matter what may come of the earth, is his personal happiness. He is not a means to an end, and he is not a servant of his brothers. His miracles are his and his alone, and he will protect them from others at all costs. He says that his treasures are his thoughts, his will, and his freedom, and the greatest of these is freedom. He owes nothing to his brothers. They owe him nothing, and he wants nothing from them. Those of his brothers who earn his honor will have it, but they will not have it just by virtue of being fellow men. He chooses his friends and he chooses when to join with them and when not to. He neither commands nor obeys. In Equality 7-2521's newfound view, the word \"we\" must always be a second thought to men, after the word \"I. When it is allowed to become a primary thought, it is the root of all evil and becomes a great lie. The word \"we\" enables the weak to steal from the strong and becomes a stone that crushes all those beneath it. Equality 7-2521 vows that he is finished with the old society and collectivism. He has seen the face of god, and he will raise it above the earth so that everyone may worship at its altar. His new god is \"I","Finally Equality 7-2521 discovers the word \"I\" through his reading of the old scripts. Rand couldn't resist doing some direct sermonizing in this chapter, and these are some of her important quotes : \"I am the warrant and the sanction.\" \"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.\" \"My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end.\" \"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I cover no man's soul, nor is my soul theirs to cover.\""],"next summary id":"chapter 12","next chapter":"Equality 7-2521 figures out that \"I\" is the word he seeks when he reads one of the books in the house. When he sees the word, he understands and weeps in pity for man, knowing why he had never felt guilt for his sins and that centuries of repression will not destroy man's spirit. He reads for days and tells the Golden One about what he learns. In answer, she looks at him and says, \"I love you.\" He decides that they must choose their own names that distinguish them from others as names used to do in the Unmentionable Times. He chooses Prometheus, after the ancient man who brought light from god to man and was punished for his kindness. For the Golden One, he chooses Gaea, after the earth goddess who was the mother of all other gods. Prometheus now sees his future clearly. He recalls the Saint of the pyre, who chose Prometheus as his heir when Prometheus was only ten years old. Prometheus is now the heir of those who died for the cause of the word \"I.\" He plans to live in his house and survive on the products of his own hands while learning more from his books. Prometheus hopes to rebuild what the present has lost and go even further, while others with his skill continue to be held back by the weak and the dull-witted. He learns that in the past, men called his power of the sky Electricity and that electricity had been the source of many of their inventions. He decides to repair the motor that provides electricity to the house and bring light to his house. He will also use wires to create a barrier separating his property from other men because although they have the advantage of numbers, they do not have his mind. Gaea is pregnant, and Prometheus plans to raise their son as a man who understands the concept of \"I\" and takes pride in his own spirit. After he learns as much as he can from his new home, he also hopes to return to the City and retrieve his friend International 4-8818, as well as those such as Fraternity 2-5503 and Solidarity 9-6347 who feel their servitude and the loss of their individuality. He plans to lead them to his home and \"write the first chapter in the new history of man.\" Looking on the history of men, he wonders how man had abandoned his spirit for so long when all he had to do was remain free of other men after freeing himself from gods, kings, and birthrights and declaring himself to hold inalienable rights. He gave up his freedom for the word \"We\" and lost everything he had made, and anyone who sought as Prometheus had to regain it was punished. He asks why men had not anticipated their fall and suggests that a few men might have foreseen it but went unheeded. Prometheus wishes that he could tell the men who failed to stop the decay that hope still exists because \"man will go on. Man, not men.\" He and his friends will rebuild against the decrees of other men and of the Councils, and one day he will free the cities from enslavement. To signify his fight for freedom, he will carve the immortal word \"ego\" into the stone of his home."}

No matter how hard society might try, that \\\"I\\\" can never be completely destroyed by it. Equality 7-2521 spent days reading the books he found.

Equality 7-2521 also told Liberty 5-3000 that it was time to get some new names. He decided to be Prometheus, after a heroic figure from mythology. Equality 7-2521 decided to call Liberty 5-3000 \\\"Gaea,\\\" after the earth goddess. Now, Equality 7-2521 - a.k.a. Prometheus - writes, he sees his own future life clearly. He will live in the house with Gaea, learn to grow their own food, and study the books carefully. Already, he's learned that the power he used in his light-box is called electricity, and that it was electricity that powered the house in which he's living. He plans to learn how to produce and control it. He'll even build an electric fence around the house, once he figures out how. Apparently, Gaea is already pregnant with Prometheus' child.

Prometheus wonders how it could have been possible that human beings, after slowly winning their freedom from gods, kings, and each other, could have given it up again? The answer he comes up with? People started to worship the word \\\"we.\\\" And once that happened, civilization fell apart. Free thinking perished, and so did all of the great individuals who had kept society functioning. Prometheus is still shocked that it was ever able to happen, and that people did not see what was going on as it happened. But, he proclaims, \\\"man will go on. Man, not men\\\" . Prometheus swears that the day will come when he will destroy the cities and free all of the enslaved. And his home will be the capital of the new world. Prometheus promises to fight for the freedom of man, and for the holy word, which will be his banner. \\\"The word which can never die on this earth, for it is the heart of it, and the meaning, and the glory\\\" . The word? You guessed it: \\\"EGO.\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"It was when I read the first of the books I found in my house\nthat I saw the word \"I.\" And when I understood this word, the\nbook fell from my hands, and I wept, I who had never known tears.\nI wept in deliverance and in pity for all mankind.\n\nI understood the blessed thing which I had called my curse. I\nunderstood why the best in me had been my sins and my\ntransgressions; and why I had never felt guilt in my sins. I\nunderstood that centuries of chains and lashes will not kill the\nspirit of man nor the sense of truth within him.\n\nI read {+many+} books for many days. Then I called the Golden One,\nand I told her what I had read and what I had learned. She looked\nat me and the first words she spoke were:\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\nThen I said:\n\n\"My dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names.\nThere was a time when each man had a name of his own to\ndistinguish him from all other men. So let us choose our names. I\nhave read of a man who lived many thousands of years ago, and of\nall the names in these books, his is the one I wish to bear. He\ntook the light of the gods and [-he-] brought it to men, and he taught\nmen to be gods. And he suffered for his deed as all bearers of\nlight must suffer. His name was Prometheus.\"\n\n\"It shall be your name,\" said the Golden One.\n\n\"And I have read of a goddess,\" I said, \"who was the mother of\nthe earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. Let this be\nyour name, my Golden One, for you are to be the mother of a new\nkind of gods.\"\n\n\"It shall be my name,\" said the Golden One.\n\nNow I look ahead. My future is clear before me. The Saint of the\npyre had seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the\nheir of all the saints and all the martyrs who came before him\nand who died for the same cause, for the same word, no matter\nwhat name they gave to their cause and their truth.\n\nI shall live here, in my own house. I shall take my food from the\nearth by the toil of my own hands. I shall learn many secrets\nfrom my books. Through the years ahead, I shall rebuild the\nachievements of the past, and open the way to carry them further,\nthe achievements which are open to me, but closed forever to my\nbrothers, for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest [-ones-]\namong them.\n\nI have learned that [-my-] {+the+} power of the sky was known to men long\nago; they called it Electricity. It was the power that moved\ntheir greatest inventions. It lit this house with light [-which-] {+that+} came\nfrom those globes of glass on the walls. I have found the engine\nwhich produced this light. I shall learn how to repair it and how\nto make it work again. I shall learn how to use the wires which\ncarry this power. Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my\nhome, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light\nas a cobweb, more impassable [-that-] {+than+} a wall of granite; a barrier my\nbrothers will never be able to cross. For they have nothing to\nfight me with, save the brute force of their numbers. I have my\nmind.\n\nThen here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and\nnothing above me but the sun, I shall live my own truth. Gaea is\npregnant with my child.  [-Our son\nwill be raised as a man.-] He will be taught to say \"I\" and to bear\nthe pride of it. He will be taught to walk straight [-and-] on his own\nfeet. He will be taught reverence for his own spirit.\n\nWhen I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when\nmy home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day,\nfor the last time, into the cursed City of my birth. I shall call\nto me my friend who has no name save International 4-8818, and\nall those like him, Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason,\nand Solidarity [-9-6347-] {+8-6347+} who calls for help in the night, and a few\nothers. I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit\nhas not been killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of\ntheir brothers. They will follow me and I shall lead them to my\nfortress. And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my\nchosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter\nin the new history of man.\n\nThese are the {+last+} things before me. And as I stand here at the\ndoor of glory, I look behind me for the last time. I look upon\nthe history of men, which I have learned from the books, and I\nwonder. It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it was\nthe spirit of man's freedom. But what is freedom? Freedom from\nwhat? There is nothing to take a man's freedom away from him,\nsave other men. To be free, a man must be free of his brothers.\nThat is freedom. That and nothing else.\n\nAt first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their\nchains.  [-The-] {+Then+} he was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their\nchains. He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race.\nBut he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a\nman has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take\naway from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right\nof man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he\nstood on the threshold of [-the-] freedom for which the blood of the\ncenturies behind him had been spilled.\n\nBut then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his\nsavage beginning.\n\nWhat brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away\nfrom men? What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and\nsubmission? The worship of the word \"We.\"\n\nWhen men accepted that worship, the structure {+of centuries\ncollapsed about them, the structure+} whose every beam had come\nfrom the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages,\nfrom the depth of some one spirit, such [-spirit-] as {+spirit+} existed but for\nits own sake. Those men who [-survived-] {+survived-+} those eager to obey, eager\nto live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate [-them--those-]\n{+them- those+} men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they\nhad received. Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom\nperish on earth. Thus did [-men---] {+men-+} men with nothing to offer save\ntheir great [-number--\nlost-] {+numbers- lose+} the steel towers, the flying ships, the\npower wires, all the things they had not created and could never\nkeep. Perhaps, later, some men had been born with the mind and\nthe courage to recover these things which were lost; perhaps\nthese men came before the Councils of Scholars. They [-were-] answered as\nI have been [-answered---] {+answered-+} and for the same reasons.\n\nBut I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years\nof transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were\ngoing, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate. I\nwonder, for it is hard for me to conceive how men who knew the word [-\"I\"-] {+\"I,\"+}\ncould give it up and not know what they {+had+} lost. But such has been\nthe story, for I have lived in the City of the damned,\nand I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them.\n\nPerhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of\nclear sight and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word.\nWhat agony must have been theirs before that which they saw\ncoming and could not stop! Perhaps they cried out in protest and\nin warning. But men paid no heed to their warning. And they, [-these-]\n{+those+} few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their\nbanners smeared by their own blood. And they chose to perish, for\nthey knew. To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity.\n\n[-Their-]\n\n{+Theirs+} is the banner in my hand. And I wish I had the power to\ntell them that the despair of their hearts was not to be final,\nand their night was not without hope. For the battle they lost\ncan never be lost. For that which they died to save can never\nperish. Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which\nmen are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this\nearth. It may sleep, but it will awaken. It may wear chains, but\nit will break through. And man will go on. Man, not men.\n\n[-Here-]\n\n{+Here,+} on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall\nbuild our new land and our fort. And it will become as the heart\nof the earth, lost and hidden at first, but beating, beating\nlouder each day. And word of it will reach every corner of the\nearth. And the roads of the world will become as veins which will\ncarry the best of the world's blood to my threshold. And all my\nbrothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but\nthey will be impotent against me. And the day will come when I\nshall break [-all-] the chains of the earth, and raze the cities of the\nenslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where\neach man will be free to exist for his own sake.\n\nFor the coming of that day [-shall-] I {+shall+} fight, I and my sons and my\nchosen friends. For the freedom of Man. For his rights. For his\nlife. For his honor.\n\nAnd here, over the portals of my fort, I shall cut in the stone\nthe word which is to be my beacon and my banner. The word which\nwill not die, should we all perish in battle. The word which can\nnever die on this earth, for it is the heart of it and the\nmeaning and the glory.\n\nThe sacred word:\n\nEGO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":1627.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 12","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200928194548\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/anthem-ayn-rand\/summary\/chapter-12","summary_text":"Equality 7-2521 explains that he discovered the word \"I\" when he read the first book he found in the house.

He stands on the mountain's peak and spreads his arms, knowing that his existence is the answer. He needs no reason to exist because he is his own reason. He names his eyes and ears as the organs which give significance and beauty to the world. His mind and his judgment are the only things that can find truth, and his will is the only thing that can make his choices. Some words are wise and others are false, but only the words \"I will it\" are holy. He knows now that he is the end of his journey, and he does not care of the overall significance of the earth because he knows about happiness. The fulfillment of happiness, in his view, is its own purpose. Furthermore, he refuses to be a tool for anyone else's accomplishments or happiness. Declaring himself to be a man and his own miracle, he decides that he cannot share or give away his treasures of thought, will, and especially freedom. He cannot help \"the poor of spirit\" by giving up his own spirit. He owes nothing to his brothers, but neither does he require anything of them. In particular, he states that he is not by default a friend or an enemy to other men because love and honor must be earned.

The acquisition of this knowledge fulfills the intellectual quest on which Equality 7-2521 had embarked as a 10-year-old -- the attempt to discover and understand the Unspeakable Word. He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He had wished to find a warrant for being, but now understands that he needs neither warrant nor sanction. He is the warrant and sanction of his existence. He is overcome with the emotional experience of his intellectual realization: he has a right to his own life. He is not a mere appendage of a group. He can choose his own path in life -- his own interests, his own profession, his own wife, his own home. He is a free man, able to choose his goals, and then work strenuously to achieve them. Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service. An individual is \"not a sacrifice on their altars.\" Equality 7-2521 realizes, after studying the books of the Unmentionable Times, what the proper relation is between individuals. He owes no unchosen obligations to his brothers and sisters, nor do they owe him such. He states that he is neither a friend nor a foe to others, \"but such as each of them shall deserve.\" Love, he claims, must be earned -- and that requires more than the sheer fact of being born; it requires the attainment of virtue. Equality 7-2521 will choose friends from among his fellow humans, but neither masters nor servants. He says that he will love and respect his friends, but neither command nor obey them. And when humans come together in friendship and in love, they will join hands only beyond each one's \"holy threshold,\" and each will respect the personal boundaries of the other. Looking back on his past life in the city -- and thinking sorrowfully of those innocent people still trapped there -- he realizes that the horrors of his former society are the result of destroying the personal boundaries that each individual properly claims as their own. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is forever done with the code of \"we,\" with this creed of evil and destruction. He sees clearly the beneficent consequences that can result -- as they did in the past -- when society recognizes the sacred rights of individuals to mind, soul, values, and life. He observes the face of a god, the god sought by humans since the inception of the world, the god who will grant joy and peace and pride. \"This god, this one word: I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will. Equality 7-2521 realizes the meaning of the word \"I\" and realizes what has been missing from his world. He writes about standing at the summit of a mountain and concludes that he has reached the end of his quest to find the meaning of things because he is the meaning of things. His eyes' seeing makes the earth beautiful, and his ears' hearing makes the earth sing. His mind's searching gives the earth truth. His will is the only command he respects or should respect. In his new view, the only three holy words are \"I will it. Equality 7-2521 realizes that the goal of his existence, no matter what may come of the earth, is his personal happiness. He is not a means to an end, and he is not a servant of his brothers. His miracles are his and his alone, and he will protect them from others at all costs. He says that his treasures are his thoughts, his will, and his freedom, and the greatest of these is freedom. He owes nothing to his brothers. They owe him nothing, and he wants nothing from them. Those of his brothers who earn his honor will have it, but they will not have it just by virtue of being fellow men. He chooses his friends and he chooses when to join with them and when not to. He neither commands nor obeys. In Equality 7-2521's newfound view, the word \"we\" must always be a second thought to men, after the word \"I. When it is allowed to become a primary thought, it is the root of all evil and becomes a great lie. The word \"we\" enables the weak to steal from the strong and becomes a stone that crushes all those beneath it. Equality 7-2521 vows that he is finished with the old society and collectivism. He has seen the face of god, and he will raise it above the earth so that everyone may worship at its altar. His new god is \"I","Finally Equality 7-2521 discovers the word \"I\" through his reading of the old scripts. Rand couldn't resist doing some direct sermonizing in this chapter, and these are some of her important quotes : \"I am the warrant and the sanction.\" \"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.\" \"My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end.\" \"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I cover no man's soul, nor is my soul theirs to cover.\""],"next summary id":"chapter 12","next chapter":"Equality 7-2521 explains that he discovered the word \"I\" when he read the first book he found in the house. When he finally understood the word, he started to cry, and dropped the book. It was that beautiful. Equality 7-2521 also understood that it had been his sense of himself - of \"I\" - that revolted against his society and made him sin. No matter how hard society might try, that \"I\" can never be completely destroyed by it. Equality 7-2521 spent days reading the books he found. At last, he told Liberty 5-3000 what he had discovered. When she learned the word \"I,\" Liberty 5-3000 told Equality 7-2521 \"I love you.\" Finally, What a relief. Equality 7-2521 also told Liberty 5-3000 that it was time to get some new names. He decided to be Prometheus, after a heroic figure from mythology. Equality 7-2521 decided to call Liberty 5-3000 \"Gaea,\" after the earth goddess. Now, Equality 7-2521 - a.k.a. Prometheus - writes, he sees his own future life clearly. He will live in the house with Gaea, learn to grow their own food, and study the books carefully. Already, he's learned that the power he used in his light-box is called electricity, and that it was electricity that powered the house in which he's living. He plans to learn how to produce and control it. He'll even build an electric fence around the house, once he figures out how. Apparently, Gaea is already pregnant with Prometheus' child. When he's born , Prometheus will raise him like a real man, who knows the word \"I.\" Prometheus plans to eventually return to his old City, to find all of the individuals whose spirit hasn't been crushed yet, like International 4-8818. He'll lead them out of the City, to Freedom. Prometheus says Freedom means freedom from one's brothers. It is only other people that can take an individual's freedom away. Prometheus wonders how it could have been possible that human beings, after slowly winning their freedom from gods, kings, and each other, could have given it up again? The answer he comes up with? People started to worship the word \"we.\" And once that happened, civilization fell apart. Free thinking perished, and so did all of the great individuals who had kept society functioning. Prometheus is still shocked that it was ever able to happen, and that people did not see what was going on as it happened. But, he proclaims, \"man will go on. Man, not men\" . Prometheus swears that the day will come when he will destroy the cities and free all of the enslaved. And his home will be the capital of the new world. Prometheus promises to fight for the freedom of man, and for the holy word, which will be his banner. \"The word which can never die on this earth, for it is the heart of it, and the meaning, and the glory\" . The word? You guessed it: \"EGO.\""}

Equality 7-2521 reads many books for many days. When he finally lays aside his studies, he calls the Golden One and tells her what he has learned. Her first words on hearing his discoveries are: \\\"I love you.\\\" He tells her that the code of individualism requires each person to have their own name to differentiate them from the rest of humankind. He tells her of a figure about whom he has read. He was a legendary hero who lived far in the past, who took the light of the gods and brought it to humans. In this way, \\\"he taught men to be gods.\\\" He suffered for his deeds as all bearers of light must suffer. His name was Prometheus. \\\"It shall be your name,\\\" replies the Golden One. Additionally, he tells her of a heroine from the legends of the past. She was a goddess who was the mother of the earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. He requests that the Golden One take this name, for she is to be the mother of a new kind of gods. The Golden One agrees. Prometheus looks ahead and sees the future clearly before him. Prometheus says that he will continue to live in his own house and learn to grow food by tilling the soil. He will gain much knowledge from his books and use that knowledge in the coming years to re-create the achievements of the past. He is proud of the attainments he can reach, but also saddened by the inability of others to do the same, for their minds are shackled by the collectivist philosophy that keeps them enslaved. Prometheus learns that the power of the sky was known to the freethinkers of the past; they called it electricity and used it to light their cities, heat their homes, and power their inventions. He has found the engine in the home that produces this power and will learn to repair it. He will study the wires that carry this power, learn how to use them, and then create a network of wires around his house and the paths that lead to his house. In this way, he will make the house impregnable from assault by others, for they have nothing with which to threaten him but their numbers. They use brute force, but he uses his mind. Prometheus and Gaea will live on their mountaintop in peace and security. He says that she is pregnant with his child, who will be raised as a free man. Their son will be taught the word \\\"I\\\" and will learn reverence for his own spirit. He will learn what pride there is in being a human individual. When Prometheus's work is accomplished -- when he has read the books, fortified their home, and tilled the soil -- he intends to stealthily venture for the last time into the city of his birth. There he will call to him all those of independent spirit who remain -- his friend International 4-8818 and all those like him. He will seek out Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason, and Solidarity 9-6347, who screams in the night. He will reach out to any of the men and women whose heads are still unbowed, who retain the slightest spark of autonomy and who yearn in some form for freedom. These individuals will flock to him, and they will return to his fortress. Prometheus says that here, in the uncharted wilderness, they will build their city and write a new chapter in the history of human freedom.\", \"analysis\": \"That the hero and heroine take new names is significant for several reasons. They reject the collectivist names that were imposed on them by the slave society in which they were raised. The name Equality 7-2521 stands for a particular aspect of collectivist thinking. The collectivists do not mean by the term \\\"equality\\\" the individualistic principle that all individuals possess the same legal rights and are to be treated identically by the law. The collectivists mean that all are equal in an absolute sense -- that no individual is or should be better than the crowd, that no one possesses greater talent than others or greater intelligence or greater virtue. It is the equality of an ant colony, in which all individuals are equally subordinated to and enslaved by the rulers. The collectivists seek to prevent individuals from rising, from attaining excellence, from standing out, from achieving pride in their own person and accomplishments. Individuals free to live their lives and actualize their potential -- who hold high standards in all areas of life and strive to consistently meet them -- are not readily malleable by an all-powerful state. Such individuals do not conform or obey. They are independent, living by their own thinking, pursuing their own values, striving for their own happiness. But others taught that they have no right to rise above the herd, that they must seek no distinction, that each is the same as all, such unfortunates will bow and kneel and follow. Believing themselves no more than a cog in a vast machine, they will seek no individuality and will be ready clay for their masters to mold. The hero rejects this philosophy of humanity, and consequently rejects the name that embodies it. Further, the numbers that follow every person's name are a means by which the rulers instill the same collectivist lesson. A human being is not an individual, according to the collectivist philosophy; he is merely a fragmented part of a greater whole. Mandating that numbers follow each name, in amounts running to four or five digits, signifies that each person is only one of thousands bearing the same name, belonging to the same tribe, serving the same group. No one person is unique, unrepeatable, or outstanding. She is merely a numbered and controlled member of society, a splintered part of which the group is the whole. The numbers and the collectivist names combine with the eradication of the word \\\"I\\\" to form a collectivist culture designed to extirpate even the knowledge of individuality. The hero and heroine, as an act symbolizing their commitment to an individualistic philosophy, must repudiate the practice of attaching numbers to a person's name. Further, even though the Golden One's given name is Liberty 5-3000, the word \\\"liberty\\\" is so corrupted by the collectivists that it stands for the exact opposite of its original meaning. In the collectivist culture, liberty means not the inalienable right of each person to sovereign individuality, but rather the \\\"right\\\" of each person to be subordinate to the group. The collectivists, in their attempt to create universal slavery, corrupt the language -- the very ideas and terms with which persons think -- so as to obliterate all thoughts that clash with their push for blind obedience. The very concepts of individualism and freedom are expropriated and used to designate meanings that are the polar opposite of their originals. George Orwell, in his famous book, 1984, shows the collectivist dictators similarly corrupting the vocabulary of liberty by making such irrational claims as \\\"Freedom is slavery.\\\" Prometheus and Gaea, at this point in the story, finally understand the full evil of collectivism and repudiate all its forms and trappings, including the bastardized name originally given the Golden One. As befitting free individuals, they will choose their own names. From studying his books, Prometheus has learned a good deal about the history of the Unmentionable Times. Although no specific historical details are given, it is reasonable to infer that he is knowledgeable regarding the ideas of the eighteenth century Enlightenment and the creation of the United States. He says that breaking free of the bonds imposed by various tyrants, persons of past eras \\\"declared to all his brothers that a man has rights,\\\" and so \\\"stood on the threshold of the freedom for which the blood of the centuries past had been spilled.\\\" Prometheus here refers to the ideas of such seventeenth- and eighteenth-century thinkers as John Locke and Voltaire, who argued that rational beings owed blind obedience to neither church nor state, but possessed the right to direct the course of their own life. Prometheus also has in mind men such as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and the other thinkers of America's founding period, who wrote the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. The men responsible for the founding of the American republic were individualists who believed that the only moral purpose of government was to protect the right of individual citizens to pursue their own happiness. Clearly, from his brief commentary, Prometheus has learned these important facts of history and greatly admires these freedom fighters of the past. Further, Prometheus now knows the history of collectivism's development in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Although he does not mention the specific historical details, his readings will have informed him of the work of the German philosophers G.W.F. Hegel and Karl Marx, whose writings proclaimed the superiority of the nation and\/or the working class to the individual. Hegel and Marx stressed the moral obligation of the individual to be subordinate to the needs of the group -- and it was largely their teachings that led to the rise of National Socialism in Germany, to Communism in the Soviet Union, and to Fascism in Italy, the context in which Rand wrote Anthem. Prometheus understands that as the collectivist doctrines spread around the globe, they eventually swallowed the free countries and turned them into totalitarian dictatorships as well. In this fictional universe created by the author, the doctrine of individual rights died in countries such as the United States because humans were gradually taught to worship the word \\\"we\\\" and renounce their reverence for the word \\\"I.\\\" But Prometheus, like some Thomas Jefferson of the future, does not intend to permit the spirit of freedom to die out on the earth. It is not enough that he, his family, and his friends will live in freedom on their protected mountaintop. He intends to rekindle the battle for individual rights, to challenge the global collectivist state, and to initiate a new revolution on behalf of political freedom. Prometheus will bring more than electric light to his society; he will provide something of far greater value than that. He will bring the light of freedom back into human lives after centuries of absence. Prometheus is confident about the ultimate triumph of individualism and freedom over collectivism. The most important consideration regards the role of the mind in human life. Because the collectivists value blind obedience above all, they necessarily view the freethinking mind as their most dangerous foe. Independent thinkers like Prometheus have their own ideas and arrive at their own conclusions by a process of logical thought. They hold their own minds as sacred, enabling them to discover new truths in the field of electricity, or in biology, physics, medicine, music, philosophy, and so on. Free minds like these do not confine their judgment to issues in the professional fields they choose; they think also on moral and political issues and recognize the grave injustices of the collectivist dictatorship. They speak out on behalf of an individual's rights and in defense of political freedom. Thinkers such as Prometheus represent a profound threat to the unquestioned authority of the collectivist leaders. For this reason, collectivists are ruthless in stamping out any hint or vestige of independence in their subjects. Because the authorities recognized the precociousness of Prometheus's intellect, not in spite of it, they consigned him in his youth to the profession of Street Sweeper, denying him the logical choice of being a Scholar. Because the collectivists stifle the mind, they have lost all elements of scientific and technological progress, including in the realm of military weapons. They are utterly primitive in all areas of their lives. Prometheus knows this. He knows too that he and his wife and friends are nothing like this. They are men and women of the mind. Prometheus always knew implicitly that it was by means of independent thinking that humans survive and prosper on earth; this is why he was always fascinated by the \\\"science of things,\\\" and why he defied all laws and rules to experiment alone in his tunnel. Now, after his reading regarding the accomplishments of the freethinkers of the past -- given his knowledge of their \\\"steel towers, flying ships and power wires\\\" -- he knows explicitly the importance of the mind. He and his friends will use the supreme power of their minds to defend themselves. Prometheus already plans to study the generator by means of which electric power in his home was formerly produced. He will learn to repair or replicate it. His study of electrical engineering will, in the future, enable him to create new products of immense use to his life and those of his friends. Further, he will erect a barrier of electric wires to protect his mountaintop fortress, and similarly will employ his scientific genius to create other weapons to be deployed should the collectivists make war on him. He knows that in any conflict between mind and brute force, the mind will triumph. Finally, he is confident about the outcome of any clash between himself and the collectivists due to his awareness of the undying human spirit. Speaking of the heroic freedom fighters of the past about whom he has read, he states that their battle is one that can never be lost; that the liberty they died to save can never perish. The human mind and soul will eternally hunger for freedom; this aspiration can never be killed by any dictator or collectivist state. Humans suffering under the yoke of tyranny will, when liberty is offered to them, seize the opportunity to live as free persons. Prometheus now understands that the human mind requires freedom -- successful life on earth requires it -- and therefore the soul yearns for it. The human desire for freedom cannot be squelched, and Prometheus's battle cannot be lost. Glossary Prometheus legendary titan of Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and brought it to earth. He was punished by Zeus, who chained him to a rock and had a vulture eat out his liver daily. But thereafter humans had fire to keep warm and to light the darkest night. Gaea goddess of Greek mythology who gave birth to the earth and to the titans. City of the Damned city in which Prometheus and Gaea formerly resided, and from which they fled. Ego the self. That aspect of an individual that thinks, forms values, and makes judgments. Here it refers to the need that individuals have to be liberated of the stifling restraints of collectivism, free to use their own minds and glory in their own individual uniqueness.\"}","chapter":"It was when I read the first of the books I found in my house\nthat I saw the word \"I.\" And when I understood this word, the\nbook fell from my hands, and I wept, I who had never known tears.\nI wept in deliverance and in pity for all mankind.\n\nI understood the blessed thing which I had called my curse. I\nunderstood why the best in me had been my sins and my\ntransgressions; and why I had never felt guilt in my sins. I\nunderstood that centuries of chains and lashes will not kill the\nspirit of man nor the sense of truth within him.\n\nI read {+many+} books for many days. Then I called the Golden One,\nand I told her what I had read and what I had learned. She looked\nat me and the first words she spoke were:\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\nThen I said:\n\n\"My dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names.\nThere was a time when each man had a name of his own to\ndistinguish him from all other men. So let us choose our names. I\nhave read of a man who lived many thousands of years ago, and of\nall the names in these books, his is the one I wish to bear. He\ntook the light of the gods and [-he-] brought it to men, and he taught\nmen to be gods. And he suffered for his deed as all bearers of\nlight must suffer. His name was Prometheus.\"\n\n\"It shall be your name,\" said the Golden One.\n\n\"And I have read of a goddess,\" I said, \"who was the mother of\nthe earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. Let this be\nyour name, my Golden One, for you are to be the mother of a new\nkind of gods.\"\n\n\"It shall be my name,\" said the Golden One.\n\nNow I look ahead. My future is clear before me. The Saint of the\npyre had seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the\nheir of all the saints and all the martyrs who came before him\nand who died for the same cause, for the same word, no matter\nwhat name they gave to their cause and their truth.\n\nI shall live here, in my own house. I shall take my food from the\nearth by the toil of my own hands. I shall learn many secrets\nfrom my books. Through the years ahead, I shall rebuild the\nachievements of the past, and open the way to carry them further,\nthe achievements which are open to me, but closed forever to my\nbrothers, for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest [-ones-]\namong them.\n\nI have learned that [-my-] {+the+} power of the sky was known to men long\nago; they called it Electricity. It was the power that moved\ntheir greatest inventions. It lit this house with light [-which-] {+that+} came\nfrom those globes of glass on the walls. I have found the engine\nwhich produced this light. I shall learn how to repair it and how\nto make it work again. I shall learn how to use the wires which\ncarry this power. Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my\nhome, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light\nas a cobweb, more impassable [-that-] {+than+} a wall of granite; a barrier my\nbrothers will never be able to cross. For they have nothing to\nfight me with, save the brute force of their numbers. I have my\nmind.\n\nThen here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and\nnothing above me but the sun, I shall live my own truth. Gaea is\npregnant with my child.  [-Our son\nwill be raised as a man.-] He will be taught to say \"I\" and to bear\nthe pride of it. He will be taught to walk straight [-and-] on his own\nfeet. He will be taught reverence for his own spirit.\n\nWhen I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when\nmy home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day,\nfor the last time, into the cursed City of my birth. I shall call\nto me my friend who has no name save International 4-8818, and\nall those like him, Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason,\nand Solidarity [-9-6347-] {+8-6347+} who calls for help in the night, and a few\nothers. I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit\nhas not been killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of\ntheir brothers. They will follow me and I shall lead them to my\nfortress. And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my\nchosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter\nin the new history of man.\n\nThese are the {+last+} things before me. And as I stand here at the\ndoor of glory, I look behind me for the last time. I look upon\nthe history of men, which I have learned from the books, and I\nwonder. It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it was\nthe spirit of man's freedom. But what is freedom? Freedom from\nwhat? There is nothing to take a man's freedom away from him,\nsave other men. To be free, a man must be free of his brothers.\nThat is freedom. That and nothing else.\n\nAt first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their\nchains.  [-The-] {+Then+} he was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their\nchains. He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race.\nBut he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a\nman has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take\naway from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right\nof man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he\nstood on the threshold of [-the-] freedom for which the blood of the\ncenturies behind him had been spilled.\n\nBut then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his\nsavage beginning.\n\nWhat brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away\nfrom men? What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and\nsubmission? The worship of the word \"We.\"\n\nWhen men accepted that worship, the structure {+of centuries\ncollapsed about them, the structure+} whose every beam had come\nfrom the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages,\nfrom the depth of some one spirit, such [-spirit-] as {+spirit+} existed but for\nits own sake. Those men who [-survived-] {+survived-+} those eager to obey, eager\nto live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate [-them--those-]\n{+them- those+} men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they\nhad received. Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom\nperish on earth. Thus did [-men---] {+men-+} men with nothing to offer save\ntheir great [-number--\nlost-] {+numbers- lose+} the steel towers, the flying ships, the\npower wires, all the things they had not created and could never\nkeep. Perhaps, later, some men had been born with the mind and\nthe courage to recover these things which were lost; perhaps\nthese men came before the Councils of Scholars. They [-were-] answered as\nI have been [-answered---] {+answered-+} and for the same reasons.\n\nBut I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years\nof transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were\ngoing, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate. I\nwonder, for it is hard for me to conceive how men who knew the word [-\"I\"-] {+\"I,\"+}\ncould give it up and not know what they {+had+} lost. But such has been\nthe story, for I have lived in the City of the damned,\nand I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them.\n\nPerhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of\nclear sight and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word.\nWhat agony must have been theirs before that which they saw\ncoming and could not stop! Perhaps they cried out in protest and\nin warning. But men paid no heed to their warning. And they, [-these-]\n{+those+} few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their\nbanners smeared by their own blood. And they chose to perish, for\nthey knew. To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity.\n\n[-Their-]\n\n{+Theirs+} is the banner in my hand. And I wish I had the power to\ntell them that the despair of their hearts was not to be final,\nand their night was not without hope. For the battle they lost\ncan never be lost. For that which they died to save can never\nperish. Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which\nmen are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this\nearth. It may sleep, but it will awaken. It may wear chains, but\nit will break through. And man will go on. Man, not men.\n\n[-Here-]\n\n{+Here,+} on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall\nbuild our new land and our fort. And it will become as the heart\nof the earth, lost and hidden at first, but beating, beating\nlouder each day. And word of it will reach every corner of the\nearth. And the roads of the world will become as veins which will\ncarry the best of the world's blood to my threshold. And all my\nbrothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but\nthey will be impotent against me. And the day will come when I\nshall break [-all-] the chains of the earth, and raze the cities of the\nenslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where\neach man will be free to exist for his own sake.\n\nFor the coming of that day [-shall-] I {+shall+} fight, I and my sons and my\nchosen friends.

He will seek out Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason, and Solidarity 9-6347, who screams in the night. He will reach out to any of the men and women whose heads are still unbowed, who retain the slightest spark of autonomy and who yearn in some form for freedom. These individuals will flock to him, and they will return to his fortress. Prometheus says that here, in the uncharted wilderness, they will build their city and write a new chapter in the history of human freedom.","summary_analysis":"That the hero and heroine take new names is significant for several reasons. They reject the collectivist names that were imposed on them by the slave society in which they were raised. The name Equality 7-2521 stands for a particular aspect of collectivist thinking. The collectivists do not mean by the term \"equality\" the individualistic principle that all individuals possess the same legal rights and are to be treated identically by the law. The collectivists mean that all are equal in an absolute sense -- that no individual is or should be better than the crowd, that no one possesses greater talent than others or greater intelligence or greater virtue. It is the equality of an ant colony, in which all individuals are equally subordinated to and enslaved by the rulers. The collectivists seek to prevent individuals from rising, from attaining excellence, from standing out, from achieving pride in their own person and accomplishments. Individuals free to live their lives and actualize their potential -- who hold high standards in all areas of life and strive to consistently meet them -- are not readily malleable by an all-powerful state. Such individuals do not conform or obey. They are independent, living by their own thinking, pursuing their own values, striving for their own happiness. But others taught that they have no right to rise above the herd, that they must seek no distinction, that each is the same as all, such unfortunates will bow and kneel and follow. Believing themselves no more than a cog in a vast machine, they will seek no individuality and will be ready clay for their masters to mold. The hero rejects this philosophy of humanity, and consequently rejects the name that embodies it. Further, the numbers that follow every person's name are a means by which the rulers instill the same collectivist lesson. A human being is not an individual, according to the collectivist philosophy; he is merely a fragmented part of a greater whole. Mandating that numbers follow each name, in amounts running to four or five digits, signifies that each person is only one of thousands bearing the same name, belonging to the same tribe, serving the same group. No one person is unique, unrepeatable, or outstanding. She is merely a numbered and controlled member of society, a splintered part of which the group is the whole. The numbers and the collectivist names combine with the eradication of the word \"I\" to form a collectivist culture designed to extirpate even the knowledge of individuality. The hero and heroine, as an act symbolizing their commitment to an individualistic philosophy, must repudiate the practice of attaching numbers to a person's name. Further, even though the Golden One's given name is Liberty 5-3000, the word \"liberty\" is so corrupted by the collectivists that it stands for the exact opposite of its original meaning. In the collectivist culture, liberty means not the inalienable right of each person to sovereign individuality, but rather the \"right\" of each person to be subordinate to the group. The collectivists, in their attempt to create universal slavery, corrupt the language -- the very ideas and terms with which persons think -- so as to obliterate all thoughts that clash with their push for blind obedience. The very concepts of individualism and freedom are expropriated and used to designate meanings that are the polar opposite of their originals. George Orwell, in his famous book, 1984, shows the collectivist dictators similarly corrupting the vocabulary of liberty by making such irrational claims as \"Freedom is slavery.\" Prometheus and Gaea, at this point in the story, finally understand the full evil of collectivism and repudiate all its forms and trappings, including the bastardized name originally given the Golden One. As befitting free individuals, they will choose their own names. From studying his books, Prometheus has learned a good deal about the history of the Unmentionable Times. Although no specific historical details are given, it is reasonable to infer that he is knowledgeable regarding the ideas of the eighteenth century Enlightenment and the creation of the United States. He says that breaking free of the bonds imposed by various tyrants, persons of past eras \"declared to all his brothers that a man has rights,\" and so \"stood on the threshold of the freedom for which the blood of the centuries past had been spilled.\" Prometheus here refers to the ideas of such seventeenth- and eighteenth-century thinkers as John Locke and Voltaire, who argued that rational beings owed blind obedience to neither church nor state, but possessed the right to direct the course of their own life. Prometheus also has in mind men such as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and the other thinkers of America's founding period, who wrote the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. The men responsible for the founding of the American republic were individualists who believed that the only moral purpose of government was to protect the right of individual citizens to pursue their own happiness. Clearly, from his brief commentary, Prometheus has learned these important facts of history and greatly admires these freedom fighters of the past. Further, Prometheus now knows the history of collectivism's development in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Although he does not mention the specific historical details, his readings will have informed him of the work of the German philosophers G.W.F. Hegel and Karl Marx, whose writings proclaimed the superiority of the nation and\/or the working class to the individual. Hegel and Marx stressed the moral obligation of the individual to be subordinate to the needs of the group -- and it was largely their teachings that led to the rise of National Socialism in Germany, to Communism in the Soviet Union, and to Fascism in Italy, the context in which Rand wrote Anthem. Prometheus understands that as the collectivist doctrines spread around the globe, they eventually swallowed the free countries and turned them into totalitarian dictatorships as well. In this fictional universe created by the author, the doctrine of individual rights died in countries such as the United States because humans were gradually taught to worship the word \"we\" and renounce their reverence for the word \"I.\" But Prometheus, like some Thomas Jefferson of the future, does not intend to permit the spirit of freedom to die out on the earth. It is not enough that he, his family, and his friends will live in freedom on their protected mountaintop. He intends to rekindle the battle for individual rights, to challenge the global collectivist state, and to initiate a new revolution on behalf of political freedom. Prometheus will bring more than electric light to his society; he will provide something of far greater value than that. He will bring the light of freedom back into human lives after centuries of absence. Prometheus is confident about the ultimate triumph of individualism and freedom over collectivism. The most important consideration regards the role of the mind in human life. Because the collectivists value blind obedience above all, they necessarily view the freethinking mind as their most dangerous foe. Independent thinkers like Prometheus have their own ideas and arrive at their own conclusions by a process of logical thought. They hold their own minds as sacred, enabling them to discover new truths in the field of electricity, or in biology, physics, medicine, music, philosophy, and so on. Free minds like these do not confine their judgment to issues in the professional fields they choose; they think also on moral and political issues and recognize the grave injustices of the collectivist dictatorship. They speak out on behalf of an individual's rights and in defense of political freedom. Thinkers such as Prometheus represent a profound threat to the unquestioned authority of the collectivist leaders. For this reason, collectivists are ruthless in stamping out any hint or vestige of independence in their subjects. Because the authorities recognized the precociousness of Prometheus's intellect, not in spite of it, they consigned him in his youth to the profession of Street Sweeper, denying him the logical choice of being a Scholar. Because the collectivists stifle the mind, they have lost all elements of scientific and technological progress, including in the realm of military weapons. They are utterly primitive in all areas of their lives. Prometheus knows this. He knows too that he and his wife and friends are nothing like this. They are men and women of the mind. Prometheus always knew implicitly that it was by means of independent thinking that humans survive and prosper on earth; this is why he was always fascinated by the \"science of things,\" and why he defied all laws and rules to experiment alone in his tunnel. Now, after his reading regarding the accomplishments of the freethinkers of the past -- given his knowledge of their \"steel towers, flying ships and power wires\" -- he knows explicitly the importance of the mind. He and his friends will use the supreme power of their minds to defend themselves. Prometheus already plans to study the generator by means of which electric power in his home was formerly produced. He will learn to repair or replicate it. His study of electrical engineering will, in the future, enable him to create new products of immense use to his life and those of his friends. Further, he will erect a barrier of electric wires to protect his mountaintop fortress, and similarly will employ his scientific genius to create other weapons to be deployed should the collectivists make war on him. He knows that in any conflict between mind and brute force, the mind will triumph. Finally, he is confident about the outcome of any clash between himself and the collectivists due to his awareness of the undying human spirit. Speaking of the heroic freedom fighters of the past about whom he has read, he states that their battle is one that can never be lost; that the liberty they died to save can never perish. The human mind and soul will eternally hunger for freedom; this aspiration can never be killed by any dictator or collectivist state. Humans suffering under the yoke of tyranny will, when liberty is offered to them, seize the opportunity to live as free persons. Prometheus now understands that the human mind requires freedom -- successful life on earth requires it -- and therefore the soul yearns for it. The human desire for freedom cannot be squelched, and Prometheus's battle cannot be lost. Glossary Prometheus legendary titan of Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and brought it to earth. He was punished by Zeus, who chained him to a rock and had a vulture eat out his liver daily. But thereafter humans had fire to keep warm and to light the darkest night. Gaea goddess of Greek mythology who gave birth to the earth and to the titans. City of the Damned city in which Prometheus and Gaea formerly resided, and from which they fled. Ego the self. That aspect of an individual that thinks, forms values, and makes judgments.

I think. I will\" and a naming of things which belong to him, such as his hands and his spirit, Equality 7-2521 explains that he has found his answer. He stands on the mountain's peak and spreads his arms, knowing that his existence is the answer. He needs no reason to exist because he is his own reason. He names his eyes and ears as the organs which give significance and beauty to the world. His mind and his judgment are the only things that can find truth, and his will is the only thing that can make his choices. Some words are wise and others are false, but only the words \"I will it\" are holy. He knows now that he is the end of his journey, and he does not care of the overall significance of the earth because he knows about happiness. The fulfillment of happiness, in his view, is its own purpose. Furthermore, he refuses to be a tool for anyone else's accomplishments or happiness. Declaring himself to be a man and his own miracle, he decides that he cannot share or give away his treasures of thought, will, and especially freedom. He cannot help \"the poor of spirit\" by giving up his own spirit. He owes nothing to his brothers, but neither does he require anything of them. In particular, he states that he is not by default a friend or an enemy to other men because love and honor must be earned. However, he will seek friends that he respects rather than slaves or master in an unequal power relationship. They are individuals and do not need to be together except if they wish. Continuing to speak in the first person singular, Equality 7-2521 rejects the use of the word \"We\" as the default word. The collectivism implicit in the word \"We\" does nothing but cause stagnation and the sapping away of the strength of the good, the wise, and the strong. Life is nothing if every man is subject to all others. He declares himself as \"done with this creed of corruption.\" He is finished with the slavery conveyed by the word \"We.\" In its place, he substitutes the word \"I,\" which is the god that will give men control over the earth and over their own lives.","Equality 7-2521 has finally discovered the first-person singular. At last, he tells us, he's found \"the words,\" and \"the answer,\" he was looking for. He, himself, is the meaning of things. Equality 7-2521 needs no reason or \"warrant\" to be. He is his own reason for being. His own will is the only thing he needs to obey. Equality 7-2521 has realized his own happiness is his highest end. He needs no higher end to justify it, because it's the purpose of his life. He does not need to justify his life by serving others. In fact, Equality 7-2521 doesn't owe anything to anyone. If he's going to love anyone else, that person has got to earn it. The word, \"we,\" is a dangerous word, Equality 7-2521 says. Actually, it's the root of all evil. If it's made the most important word, that is. It allows the weak to steal from the strong. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is done with \"we.\" It is a monster. Now, instead, he sees the face of god. God is \"I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will.\" So opens the chapter in which Equality 7-2521 re-discovers the lost and holy word, the forbidden idea for which the Saint of the Pyre was burned at the stake. The acquisition of this knowledge fulfills the intellectual quest on which Equality 7-2521 had embarked as a 10-year-old -- the attempt to discover and understand the Unspeakable Word. He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He had wished to find a warrant for being, but now understands that he needs neither warrant nor sanction. He is the warrant and sanction of his existence. He is overcome with the emotional experience of his intellectual realization: he has a right to his own life. He is not a mere appendage of a group. He can choose his own path in life -- his own interests, his own profession, his own wife, his own home. He is a free man, able to choose his goals, and then work strenuously to achieve them. Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service. An individual is \"not a sacrifice on their altars.\" Equality 7-2521 realizes, after studying the books of the Unmentionable Times, what the proper relation is between individuals. He owes no unchosen obligations to his brothers and sisters, nor do they owe him such. He states that he is neither a friend nor a foe to others, \"but such as each of them shall deserve.\" Love, he claims, must be earned -- and that requires more than the sheer fact of being born; it requires the attainment of virtue. Equality 7-2521 will choose friends from among his fellow humans, but neither masters nor servants. He says that he will love and respect his friends, but neither command nor obey them. And when humans come together in friendship and in love, they will join hands only beyond each one's \"holy threshold,\" and each will respect the personal boundaries of the other. Looking back on his past life in the city -- and thinking sorrowfully of those innocent people still trapped there -- he realizes that the horrors of his former society are the result of destroying the personal boundaries that each individual properly claims as their own. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is forever done with the code of \"we,\" with this creed of evil and destruction. He sees clearly the beneficent consequences that can result -- as they did in the past -- when society recognizes the sacred rights of individuals to mind, soul, values, and life. He observes the face of a god, the god sought by humans since the inception of the world, the god who will grant joy and peace and pride. \"This god, this one word: I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will. Equality 7-2521 realizes the meaning of the word \"I\" and realizes what has been missing from his world. He writes about standing at the summit of a mountain and concludes that he has reached the end of his quest to find the meaning of things because he is the meaning of things. His eyes' seeing makes the earth beautiful, and his ears' hearing makes the earth sing. His mind's searching gives the earth truth. His will is the only command he respects or should respect. In his new view, the only three holy words are \"I will it. Equality 7-2521 realizes that the goal of his existence, no matter what may come of the earth, is his personal happiness. He is not a means to an end, and he is not a servant of his brothers. His miracles are his and his alone, and he will protect them from others at all costs. He says that his treasures are his thoughts, his will, and his freedom, and the greatest of these is freedom. He owes nothing to his brothers. They owe him nothing, and he wants nothing from them. Those of his brothers who earn his honor will have it, but they will not have it just by virtue of being fellow men. He chooses his friends and he chooses when to join with them and when not to. He neither commands nor obeys. In Equality 7-2521's newfound view, the word \"we\" must always be a second thought to men, after the word \"I. When it is allowed to become a primary thought, it is the root of all evil and becomes a great lie. The word \"we\" enables the weak to steal from the strong and becomes a stone that crushes all those beneath it. Equality 7-2521 vows that he is finished with the old society and collectivism. He has seen the face of god, and he will raise it above the earth so that everyone may worship at its altar. His new god is \"I","Finally Equality 7-2521 discovers the word \"I\" through his reading of the old scripts. Rand couldn't resist doing some direct sermonizing in this chapter, and these are some of her important quotes : \"I am the warrant and the sanction.\" \"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.\" \"My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end.\" \"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I cover no man's soul, nor is my soul theirs to cover.\""],"next summary id":"chapter 12","next chapter":"Equality 7-2521 says that when, in the course of his reading, he first discovered and understood the meaning of the word \"I,\" he wept -- he who had never known tears. Equality 7-2521 reads many books for many days. When he finally lays aside his studies, he calls the Golden One and tells her what he has learned. Her first words on hearing his discoveries are: \"I love you.\" He tells her that the code of individualism requires each person to have their own name to differentiate them from the rest of humankind. He tells her of a figure about whom he has read. He was a legendary hero who lived far in the past, who took the light of the gods and brought it to humans. In this way, \"he taught men to be gods.\" He suffered for his deeds as all bearers of light must suffer. His name was Prometheus. \"It shall be your name,\" replies the Golden One. Additionally, he tells her of a heroine from the legends of the past. She was a goddess who was the mother of the earth and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. He requests that the Golden One take this name, for she is to be the mother of a new kind of gods. The Golden One agrees. Prometheus looks ahead and sees the future clearly before him. Prometheus says that he will continue to live in his own house and learn to grow food by tilling the soil. He will gain much knowledge from his books and use that knowledge in the coming years to re-create the achievements of the past. He is proud of the attainments he can reach, but also saddened by the inability of others to do the same, for their minds are shackled by the collectivist philosophy that keeps them enslaved. Prometheus learns that the power of the sky was known to the freethinkers of the past; they called it electricity and used it to light their cities, heat their homes, and power their inventions. He has found the engine in the home that produces this power and will learn to repair it. He will study the wires that carry this power, learn how to use them, and then create a network of wires around his house and the paths that lead to his house. In this way, he will make the house impregnable from assault by others, for they have nothing with which to threaten him but their numbers. They use brute force, but he uses his mind. Prometheus and Gaea will live on their mountaintop in peace and security. He says that she is pregnant with his child, who will be raised as a free man. Their son will be taught the word \"I\" and will learn reverence for his own spirit. He will learn what pride there is in being a human individual. When Prometheus's work is accomplished -- when he has read the books, fortified their home, and tilled the soil -- he intends to stealthily venture for the last time into the city of his birth. There he will call to him all those of independent spirit who remain -- his friend International 4-8818 and all those like him.

Summary Equality 7-2521 tells us that he has discovered the word \\\"I\\\" while reading the books in his library. The discovery moves him to tremendous elation and pity for mankind. After he has read for some time, he calls the Golden One to him and tells her about what he has found. She listens and then tells him she loves him. He then decides that they each need a new name. He names himself Prometheus, and he names her Gaea. She accepts her name without comment. Equality 7-2521 concludes that the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, whom he saw burned at the stake in his youth, chose him as his heir to carry on his crusade after he was gone. He resolves to live in his new home and kill and raise his own food and learn the secrets of the Unmentionable Times from the books in the house. He will rebuild the world that has disintegrated at the hands of the collectivists because he is not shackled to the weakest of his society. He will build a fence of wires around his house so that no one from his old city can come onto his property unless he chooses to allow them. The Golden One becomes pregnant, and Equality 7-2521 resolves that his son will be raised as a real man who takes pride in his own existence. He will work to get his house into working order and his land planted, and when he has succeeded in renovating and restoring his home, he will go back to the city and gather the few people, including his friend International 4-8818, whose spirits have not been broken by society. He will bring them up to his home to begin a new race. Equality 7-2521 meditates on human history. He says that man was first enslaved by the gods, but that he broke free from the gods. Man was then enslaved by kings, but he revolted from the kings. He was then enslaved by his birth, kin, and race, and he broke free from all these things. He declared himself to have naturally endowed rights of which he could not be deprived. Equality 7-2521 wonders about everything that men have lost in the name of collectivism and why men could not see their demise coming. He concludes that there must have been some men who did see it coming and suffered great agonies during the fall, and he wishes he had a way to tell them across time that their hope is not forever lost. He concludes that man's spirit will always prevail over the evils of collectivism, though it may take time. He resolves that he will bring back the lost world for the sake of man's freedom, rights, life, and honor. Even if his new race fails, its members' sense of individualism will never die because these members are united under the most important word in human history: \\\"ego.\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"The renaming of the Golden One and Equality 7-2521 signals their complete transformation from the social creatures they are early on in Anthem into the free individuals they now are. Prometheus, the name Equality 7-2521 chooses for himself, was a Greek man who crept up to Olympus, the home of the gods, and stole fire from them. He brought the fire back down to humans, enabling them to cook and have light at nighttime. Equality 7-2521 chooses the name Prometheus for himself in part as a reference to his inventing the lightbulb and in part because he believes he will bring a new philosophy of individualism to the earth. Gaea, whose name Equality 7-2521 gives to the Golden One, was the Greek mother earth, who gave birth to the other gods and goddesses as well as to the sky and the sea. He chooses this name for her because she will, in his belief, give birth to a race of gods to rule the earth. Feminists object to the naming of the Golden One, who has now been named twice by her mate, and who apparently has no independent sense of self-worth. Moreover, the name Gaea promotes her as the mother of the new race but essentially makes of her nothing more than a vessel for Equality 7-2521's offspring. Rand might argue, however, that the Golden One is an active participant in the new world and that her part is to make the world beautiful and to endow her children with a sense of individualism. The characters' assumption of new names signifies that their break with society, which begins with the presentation of the lightbulb to the World Council of Scholars, is now complete and final. Critics of Rand's philosophy take issue with Equality 7-2521's winner-takes-all attitude and apparent dreams of world domination. They take issue with the fact that he co-opts the home in the forest without knowing to whom it belongs and then immediately cordons it off as his own. Furthermore, they say, Rand's championing of a new race of man has particularly sinister connotations given that Anthem was published in the United States on the heels of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's defeat during World War II. Given that Hitler too advocated the founding of a superior race of men, specifically by killing off those he believed were weighing society down, Anthem's appearance was particularly ill-timed. Rand's advocates, however, would point out that she is declaring the supremacy of human rights and that she believes each man is endowed with them. They would argue further that Rand stands in direct opposition to the kind of authoritarian oppression manifest in Hitler's Nazi regime because it deprives men of the chance to participate in the world as human beings with natural rights and a sense of their own worth. No one, they would say, should be deprived of his or her rights or life in the name of the collective society. Rand sends a message to her contemporaries fighting for individualism with Equality 7-2521's remarks that he wishes he could carry a message to those past generations that suffered during the transition period. Since Rand sees her own time as the transition from the glory of individualism, represented by the United States in the 1890s and 1920s, to the age of collectivism, represented by Russia starting around 1917, she wants both to warn those who believe in collectivism about its dangers and to bolster those who are still holding up the resistance in the name of the individual. For this reason, her hero speaks directly to those crusaders for the ego and tells them that no matter how bleak things may look, the individual will survive, and with him, the possibility of rebirth. The political nature of Anthem comes through most clearly in this last section too in which Rand lays out her plan to bring back the individual and encourages those who are helping her do so. In this way, she herself is acting as a sort of political prophet, ushering in the new age that she describes through Equality 7-2521's vision, and this prophesying proves the driving force of the whole novella.\"}","chapter":"It was when I read the first of the books I found in my house\nthat I saw the word \"I.\" And when I understood this word, the\nbook fell from my hands, and I wept, I who had never known tears.\nI wept in deliverance and in pity for all mankind.\n\nI understood the blessed thing which I had called my curse.

And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my\nchosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter\nin the new history of man.\n\nThese are the {+last+} things before me. And as I stand here at the\ndoor of glory, I look behind me for the last time. I look upon\nthe history of men, which I have learned from the books, and I\nwonder. It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it was\nthe spirit of man's freedom. But what is freedom? Freedom from\nwhat? There is nothing to take a man's freedom away from him,\nsave other men. To be free, a man must be free of his brothers.\nThat is freedom. That and nothing else.\n\nAt first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their\nchains.  [-The-] {+Then+} he was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their\nchains. He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race.\nBut he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a\nman has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take\naway from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right\nof man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he\nstood on the threshold of [-the-] freedom for which the blood of the\ncenturies behind him had been spilled.\n\nBut then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his\nsavage beginning.\n\nWhat brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away\nfrom men? What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and\nsubmission? The worship of the word \"We.\"\n\nWhen men accepted that worship, the structure {+of centuries\ncollapsed about them, the structure+} whose every beam had come\nfrom the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages,\nfrom the depth of some one spirit, such [-spirit-] as {+spirit+} existed but for\nits own sake. Those men who [-survived-] {+survived-+} those eager to obey, eager\nto live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate [-them--those-]\n{+them- those+} men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they\nhad received. Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom\nperish on earth. Thus did [-men---] {+men-+} men with nothing to offer save\ntheir great [-number--\nlost-] {+numbers- lose+} the steel towers, the flying ships, the\npower wires, all the things they had not created and could never\nkeep. Perhaps, later, some men had been born with the mind and\nthe courage to recover these things which were lost; perhaps\nthese men came before the Councils of Scholars. They [-were-] answered as\nI have been [-answered---] {+answered-+} and for the same reasons.\n\nBut I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years\nof transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were\ngoing, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate. I\nwonder, for it is hard for me to conceive how men who knew the word [-\"I\"-] {+\"I,\"+}\ncould give it up and not know what they {+had+} lost. But such has been\nthe story, for I have lived in the City of the damned,\nand I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them.\n\nPerhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of\nclear sight and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word.\nWhat agony must have been theirs before that which they saw\ncoming and could not stop! Perhaps they cried out in protest and\nin warning. But men paid no heed to their warning. And they, [-these-]\n{+those+} few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their\nbanners smeared by their own blood. And they chose to perish, for\nthey knew. To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity.\n\n[-Their-]\n\n{+Theirs+} is the banner in my hand. And I wish I had the power to\ntell them that the despair of their hearts was not to be final,\nand their night was not without hope. For the battle they lost\ncan never be lost. For that which they died to save can never\nperish. Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which\nmen are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this\nearth. It may sleep, but it will awaken. It may wear chains, but\nit will break through. And man will go on. Man, not men.\n\n[-Here-]\n\n{+Here,+} on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall\nbuild our new land and our fort. And it will become as the heart\nof the earth, lost and hidden at first, but beating, beating\nlouder each day. And word of it will reach every corner of the\nearth. And the roads of the world will become as veins which will\ncarry the best of the world's blood to my threshold. And all my\nbrothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but\nthey will be impotent against me. And the day will come when I\nshall break [-all-] the chains of the earth, and raze the cities of the\nenslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where\neach man will be free to exist for his own sake.\n\nFor the coming of that day [-shall-] I {+shall+} fight, I and my sons and my\nchosen friends.

Summary Equality 7-2521 tells us that he has discovered the word \"I\" while reading the books in his library. The discovery moves him to tremendous elation and pity for mankind. After he has read for some time, he calls the Golden One to him and tells her about what he has found. She listens and then tells him she loves him. He then decides that they each need a new name. He names himself Prometheus, and he names her Gaea. She accepts her name without comment. Equality 7-2521 concludes that the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word, whom he saw burned at the stake in his youth, chose him as his heir to carry on his crusade after he was gone. He resolves to live in his new home and kill and raise his own food and learn the secrets of the Unmentionable Times from the books in the house. He will rebuild the world that has disintegrated at the hands of the collectivists because he is not shackled to the weakest of his society. He will build a fence of wires around his house so that no one from his old city can come onto his property unless he chooses to allow them. The Golden One becomes pregnant, and Equality 7-2521 resolves that his son will be raised as a real man who takes pride in his own existence. He will work to get his house into working order and his land planted, and when he has succeeded in renovating and restoring his home, he will go back to the city and gather the few people, including his friend International 4-8818, whose spirits have not been broken by society. He will bring them up to his home to begin a new race. Equality 7-2521 meditates on human history. He says that man was first enslaved by the gods, but that he broke free from the gods. Man was then enslaved by kings, but he revolted from the kings. He was then enslaved by his birth, kin, and race, and he broke free from all these things. He declared himself to have naturally endowed rights of which he could not be deprived. Equality 7-2521 wonders about everything that men have lost in the name of collectivism and why men could not see their demise coming. He concludes that there must have been some men who did see it coming and suffered great agonies during the fall, and he wishes he had a way to tell them across time that their hope is not forever lost. He concludes that man's spirit will always prevail over the evils of collectivism, though it may take time. He resolves that he will bring back the lost world for the sake of man's freedom, rights, life, and honor. Even if his new race fails, its members' sense of individualism will never die because these members are united under the most important word in human history: \"ego.\"","summary_analysis":"The renaming of the Golden One and Equality 7-2521 signals their complete transformation from the social creatures they are early on in Anthem into the free individuals they now are. Prometheus, the name Equality 7-2521 chooses for himself, was a Greek man who crept up to Olympus, the home of the gods, and stole fire from them. He brought the fire back down to humans, enabling them to cook and have light at nighttime. Equality 7-2521 chooses the name Prometheus for himself in part as a reference to his inventing the lightbulb and in part because he believes he will bring a new philosophy of individualism to the earth. Gaea, whose name Equality 7-2521 gives to the Golden One, was the Greek mother earth, who gave birth to the other gods and goddesses as well as to the sky and the sea. He chooses this name for her because she will, in his belief, give birth to a race of gods to rule the earth. Feminists object to the naming of the Golden One, who has now been named twice by her mate, and who apparently has no independent sense of self-worth. Moreover, the name Gaea promotes her as the mother of the new race but essentially makes of her nothing more than a vessel for Equality 7-2521's offspring. Rand might argue, however, that the Golden One is an active participant in the new world and that her part is to make the world beautiful and to endow her children with a sense of individualism. The characters' assumption of new names signifies that their break with society, which begins with the presentation of the lightbulb to the World Council of Scholars, is now complete and final. Critics of Rand's philosophy take issue with Equality 7-2521's winner-takes-all attitude and apparent dreams of world domination. They take issue with the fact that he co-opts the home in the forest without knowing to whom it belongs and then immediately cordons it off as his own. Furthermore, they say, Rand's championing of a new race of man has particularly sinister connotations given that Anthem was published in the United States on the heels of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's defeat during World War II. Given that Hitler too advocated the founding of a superior race of men, specifically by killing off those he believed were weighing society down, Anthem's appearance was particularly ill-timed. Rand's advocates, however, would point out that she is declaring the supremacy of human rights and that she believes each man is endowed with them. They would argue further that Rand stands in direct opposition to the kind of authoritarian oppression manifest in Hitler's Nazi regime because it deprives men of the chance to participate in the world as human beings with natural rights and a sense of their own worth. No one, they would say, should be deprived of his or her rights or life in the name of the collective society. Rand sends a message to her contemporaries fighting for individualism with Equality 7-2521's remarks that he wishes he could carry a message to those past generations that suffered during the transition period. Since Rand sees her own time as the transition from the glory of individualism, represented by the United States in the 1890s and 1920s, to the age of collectivism, represented by Russia starting around 1917, she wants both to warn those who believe in collectivism about its dangers and to bolster those who are still holding up the resistance in the name of the individual. For this reason, her hero speaks directly to those crusaders for the ego and tells them that no matter how bleak things may look, the individual will survive, and with him, the possibility of rebirth. The political nature of Anthem comes through most clearly in this last section too in which Rand lays out her plan to bring back the individual and encourages those who are helping her do so. In this way, she herself is acting as a sort of political prophet, ushering in the new age that she describes through Equality 7-2521's vision, and this prophesying proves the driving force of the whole novella.","summary_length":527.0,"analysis_length":694.0,"chap_int":12,"previous summary id":["chapter 11","chapter 11","chapter 11","chapter 11","chapter 11"],"previous chapter":["Beginning with \"I am. I think. I will\" and a naming of things which belong to him, such as his hands and his spirit, Equality 7-2521 explains that he has found his answer. He stands on the mountain's peak and spreads his arms, knowing that his existence is the answer. He needs no reason to exist because he is his own reason. He names his eyes and ears as the organs which give significance and beauty to the world. His mind and his judgment are the only things that can find truth, and his will is the only thing that can make his choices. Some words are wise and others are false, but only the words \"I will it\" are holy. He knows now that he is the end of his journey, and he does not care of the overall significance of the earth because he knows about happiness. The fulfillment of happiness, in his view, is its own purpose. Furthermore, he refuses to be a tool for anyone else's accomplishments or happiness. Declaring himself to be a man and his own miracle, he decides that he cannot share or give away his treasures of thought, will, and especially freedom. He cannot help \"the poor of spirit\" by giving up his own spirit. He owes nothing to his brothers, but neither does he require anything of them. In particular, he states that he is not by default a friend or an enemy to other men because love and honor must be earned. However, he will seek friends that he respects rather than slaves or master in an unequal power relationship. They are individuals and do not need to be together except if they wish. Continuing to speak in the first person singular, Equality 7-2521 rejects the use of the word \"We\" as the default word. The collectivism implicit in the word \"We\" does nothing but cause stagnation and the sapping away of the strength of the good, the wise, and the strong. Life is nothing if every man is subject to all others. He declares himself as \"done with this creed of corruption.\" He is finished with the slavery conveyed by the word \"We.\" In its place, he substitutes the word \"I,\" which is the god that will give men control over the earth and over their own lives.","Equality 7-2521 has finally discovered the first-person singular. At last, he tells us, he's found \"the words,\" and \"the answer,\" he was looking for. He, himself, is the meaning of things. Equality 7-2521 needs no reason or \"warrant\" to be. He is his own reason for being. His own will is the only thing he needs to obey. Equality 7-2521 has realized his own happiness is his highest end. He needs no higher end to justify it, because it's the purpose of his life. He does not need to justify his life by serving others. In fact, Equality 7-2521 doesn't owe anything to anyone. If he's going to love anyone else, that person has got to earn it. The word, \"we,\" is a dangerous word, Equality 7-2521 says. Actually, it's the root of all evil. If it's made the most important word, that is. It allows the weak to steal from the strong. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is done with \"we.\" It is a monster. Now, instead, he sees the face of god. God is \"I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will.\" So opens the chapter in which Equality 7-2521 re-discovers the lost and holy word, the forbidden idea for which the Saint of the Pyre was burned at the stake. The acquisition of this knowledge fulfills the intellectual quest on which Equality 7-2521 had embarked as a 10-year-old -- the attempt to discover and understand the Unspeakable Word. He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He had wished to find a warrant for being, but now understands that he needs neither warrant nor sanction. He is the warrant and sanction of his existence. He is overcome with the emotional experience of his intellectual realization: he has a right to his own life. He is not a mere appendage of a group. He can choose his own path in life -- his own interests, his own profession, his own wife, his own home. He is a free man, able to choose his goals, and then work strenuously to achieve them. Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service. An individual is \"not a sacrifice on their altars.\" Equality 7-2521 realizes, after studying the books of the Unmentionable Times, what the proper relation is between individuals. He owes no unchosen obligations to his brothers and sisters, nor do they owe him such. He states that he is neither a friend nor a foe to others, \"but such as each of them shall deserve.\" Love, he claims, must be earned -- and that requires more than the sheer fact of being born; it requires the attainment of virtue. Equality 7-2521 will choose friends from among his fellow humans, but neither masters nor servants. He says that he will love and respect his friends, but neither command nor obey them. And when humans come together in friendship and in love, they will join hands only beyond each one's \"holy threshold,\" and each will respect the personal boundaries of the other. Looking back on his past life in the city -- and thinking sorrowfully of those innocent people still trapped there -- he realizes that the horrors of his former society are the result of destroying the personal boundaries that each individual properly claims as their own. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is forever done with the code of \"we,\" with this creed of evil and destruction. He sees clearly the beneficent consequences that can result -- as they did in the past -- when society recognizes the sacred rights of individuals to mind, soul, values, and life. He observes the face of a god, the god sought by humans since the inception of the world, the god who will grant joy and peace and pride. \"This god, this one word: I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will. Equality 7-2521 realizes the meaning of the word \"I\" and realizes what has been missing from his world. He writes about standing at the summit of a mountain and concludes that he has reached the end of his quest to find the meaning of things because he is the meaning of things. His eyes' seeing makes the earth beautiful, and his ears' hearing makes the earth sing. His mind's searching gives the earth truth. His will is the only command he respects or should respect. In his new view, the only three holy words are \"I will it. Equality 7-2521 realizes that the goal of his existence, no matter what may come of the earth, is his personal happiness. He is not a means to an end, and he is not a servant of his brothers. His miracles are his and his alone, and he will protect them from others at all costs. He says that his treasures are his thoughts, his will, and his freedom, and the greatest of these is freedom. He owes nothing to his brothers. They owe him nothing, and he wants nothing from them. Those of his brothers who earn his honor will have it, but they will not have it just by virtue of being fellow men. He chooses his friends and he chooses when to join with them and when not to. He neither commands nor obeys. In Equality 7-2521's newfound view, the word \"we\" must always be a second thought to men, after the word \"I. When it is allowed to become a primary thought, it is the root of all evil and becomes a great lie. The word \"we\" enables the weak to steal from the strong and becomes a stone that crushes all those beneath it. Equality 7-2521 vows that he is finished with the old society and collectivism. He has seen the face of god, and he will raise it above the earth so that everyone may worship at its altar. His new god is \"I","Finally Equality 7-2521 discovers the word \"I\" through his reading of the old scripts. Rand couldn't resist doing some direct sermonizing in this chapter, and these are some of her important quotes : \"I am the warrant and the sanction.\" \"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.\" \"My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end.\" \"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I cover no man's soul, nor is my soul theirs to cover.\""],"next summary id":"chapter xii","next chapter":"But I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years of transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were going, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate.

To be free, a man must be free of his brothers.\nThat is freedom. That and nothing else.\n\nAt first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their\nchains.  [-The-] {+Then+} he was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their\nchains. He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race.\nBut he broke their chains. He declared to all his brothers that a\nman has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take\naway from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right\nof man, and there is no right on earth above this right. And he\nstood on the threshold of [-the-] freedom for which the blood of the\ncenturies behind him had been spilled.\n\nBut then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his\nsavage beginning.\n\nWhat brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away\nfrom men? What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and\nsubmission? The worship of the word \"We.\"\n\nWhen men accepted that worship, the structure {+of centuries\ncollapsed about them, the structure+} whose every beam had come\nfrom the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages,\nfrom the depth of some one spirit, such [-spirit-] as {+spirit+} existed but for\nits own sake.

I think. I will\" and a naming of things which belong to him, such as his hands and his spirit, Equality 7-2521 explains that he has found his answer. He stands on the mountain's peak and spreads his arms, knowing that his existence is the answer. He needs no reason to exist because he is his own reason. He names his eyes and ears as the organs which give significance and beauty to the world. His mind and his judgment are the only things that can find truth, and his will is the only thing that can make his choices. Some words are wise and others are false, but only the words \"I will it\" are holy. He knows now that he is the end of his journey, and he does not care of the overall significance of the earth because he knows about happiness. The fulfillment of happiness, in his view, is its own purpose. Furthermore, he refuses to be a tool for anyone else's accomplishments or happiness. Declaring himself to be a man and his own miracle, he decides that he cannot share or give away his treasures of thought, will, and especially freedom. He cannot help \"the poor of spirit\" by giving up his own spirit. He owes nothing to his brothers, but neither does he require anything of them. In particular, he states that he is not by default a friend or an enemy to other men because love and honor must be earned. However, he will seek friends that he respects rather than slaves or master in an unequal power relationship. They are individuals and do not need to be together except if they wish. Continuing to speak in the first person singular, Equality 7-2521 rejects the use of the word \"We\" as the default word. The collectivism implicit in the word \"We\" does nothing but cause stagnation and the sapping away of the strength of the good, the wise, and the strong. Life is nothing if every man is subject to all others. He declares himself as \"done with this creed of corruption.\" He is finished with the slavery conveyed by the word \"We.\" In its place, he substitutes the word \"I,\" which is the god that will give men control over the earth and over their own lives.","Equality 7-2521 has finally discovered the first-person singular. At last, he tells us, he's found \"the words,\" and \"the answer,\" he was looking for. He, himself, is the meaning of things. Equality 7-2521 needs no reason or \"warrant\" to be. He is his own reason for being. His own will is the only thing he needs to obey. Equality 7-2521 has realized his own happiness is his highest end. He needs no higher end to justify it, because it's the purpose of his life. He does not need to justify his life by serving others. In fact, Equality 7-2521 doesn't owe anything to anyone. If he's going to love anyone else, that person has got to earn it. The word, \"we,\" is a dangerous word, Equality 7-2521 says. Actually, it's the root of all evil. If it's made the most important word, that is. It allows the weak to steal from the strong. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is done with \"we.\" It is a monster. Now, instead, he sees the face of god. God is \"I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will.\" So opens the chapter in which Equality 7-2521 re-discovers the lost and holy word, the forbidden idea for which the Saint of the Pyre was burned at the stake. The acquisition of this knowledge fulfills the intellectual quest on which Equality 7-2521 had embarked as a 10-year-old -- the attempt to discover and understand the Unspeakable Word. He had searched for meaning in life, and now realizes that he is the meaning. He had wished to find a warrant for being, but now understands that he needs neither warrant nor sanction. He is the warrant and sanction of his existence. He is overcome with the emotional experience of his intellectual realization: he has a right to his own life. He is not a mere appendage of a group. He can choose his own path in life -- his own interests, his own profession, his own wife, his own home. He is a free man, able to choose his goals, and then work strenuously to achieve them. Related to this is his realization that no individual -- neither himself nor any other human being -- is a tool to be employed by others for some end they seek to accomplish. Humans are not servants, he claims, to bow and scrape before society, to render obedient service. An individual is \"not a sacrifice on their altars.\" Equality 7-2521 realizes, after studying the books of the Unmentionable Times, what the proper relation is between individuals. He owes no unchosen obligations to his brothers and sisters, nor do they owe him such. He states that he is neither a friend nor a foe to others, \"but such as each of them shall deserve.\" Love, he claims, must be earned -- and that requires more than the sheer fact of being born; it requires the attainment of virtue. Equality 7-2521 will choose friends from among his fellow humans, but neither masters nor servants. He says that he will love and respect his friends, but neither command nor obey them. And when humans come together in friendship and in love, they will join hands only beyond each one's \"holy threshold,\" and each will respect the personal boundaries of the other. Looking back on his past life in the city -- and thinking sorrowfully of those innocent people still trapped there -- he realizes that the horrors of his former society are the result of destroying the personal boundaries that each individual properly claims as their own. Equality 7-2521 proclaims that he is forever done with the code of \"we,\" with this creed of evil and destruction. He sees clearly the beneficent consequences that can result -- as they did in the past -- when society recognizes the sacred rights of individuals to mind, soul, values, and life. He observes the face of a god, the god sought by humans since the inception of the world, the god who will grant joy and peace and pride. \"This god, this one word: I.\"","\"I am. I think. I will. Equality 7-2521 realizes the meaning of the word \"I\" and realizes what has been missing from his world. He writes about standing at the summit of a mountain and concludes that he has reached the end of his quest to find the meaning of things because he is the meaning of things. His eyes' seeing makes the earth beautiful, and his ears' hearing makes the earth sing. His mind's searching gives the earth truth. His will is the only command he respects or should respect. In his new view, the only three holy words are \"I will it. Equality 7-2521 realizes that the goal of his existence, no matter what may come of the earth, is his personal happiness. He is not a means to an end, and he is not a servant of his brothers. His miracles are his and his alone, and he will protect them from others at all costs. He says that his treasures are his thoughts, his will, and his freedom, and the greatest of these is freedom. He owes nothing to his brothers. They owe him nothing, and he wants nothing from them. Those of his brothers who earn his honor will have it, but they will not have it just by virtue of being fellow men. He chooses his friends and he chooses when to join with them and when not to. He neither commands nor obeys. In Equality 7-2521's newfound view, the word \"we\" must always be a second thought to men, after the word \"I. When it is allowed to become a primary thought, it is the root of all evil and becomes a great lie. The word \"we\" enables the weak to steal from the strong and becomes a stone that crushes all those beneath it. Equality 7-2521 vows that he is finished with the old society and collectivism. He has seen the face of god, and he will raise it above the earth so that everyone may worship at its altar. His new god is \"I","Finally Equality 7-2521 discovers the word \"I\" through his reading of the old scripts. Rand couldn't resist doing some direct sermonizing in this chapter, and these are some of her important quotes : \"I am the warrant and the sanction.\" \"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.\" \"My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end.\" \"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I cover no man's soul, nor is my soul theirs to cover.\""],"next summary id":"chapter 12","next chapter":"Equality 7-2521, who now calls himself Prometheus, after the man who \"taught men to be gods,\" now realizes that what he always considered his curse, his individuality, was and is a glorious blessing.

He finds her crying; she thought that he might have left for good, and that she was never going to see him again. He tries to comfort her, and helps her take her trunk down the stairs. At lunch he announces that he is going to take Mattie to the station himself. Zeena argues with him, but he insists vehemently that he'll be taking her. Claiming he has business in town, he plans to leave three hours before Mattie's 6 o'clock train. They set out at three, and Ethan takes advantage of the extra time to take Mattie on a long ride. They go to Shadow Pond, where he and Mattie enjoyed a church picnic together a few months earlier. Ethan takes Mattie down to a quiet spot in the woods. They talk sweetly to each other, more open in their affection than ever before. The pond, with its happy memories, becomes too painful. They return to the sleigh. As they ride on toward town Ethan asks what Mattie intends to do. Prospects aren't good, and though Mattie pretends she'll manage it seems clear that hard times are ahead of her. Mattie brings out the letter Ethan began to Zeena; she found it by accident. Ethan says, in anguish, that he can't leave the farm. But he asks Mattie if she would come with him if he could. She admits that she would, but their talk changes nothing. As they near the edge of town, Ethan persuades Mattie to come sledding with him; it's their last chance to go coasting down the hill. The find a sled and go down, despite the fact that it's twilight and the light is the most confusing of any time of day. The first trip down is exhilarating; Ethan steers well, and they reach the bottom safely. They climb up the hill and realize fully that soon they will never see each other again. Both begin to cry, unable to leave each other, telling each other that they can't bear to be apart. Mattie asks Ethan to take her down the hill again, straight into the big elm. She does not want to live without him. They get into the sled for a second ride down, Ethan in front this time. He won't be able to steer, but the track will carry them down straight into the tree. They go down the hill, but they don't die. Ethan comes to, disoriented. He is in unbelievable pain. He realizes he is holding Mattie; she, too, is still alive. He hears the horse whinnying up at the top of the hill, and he realizes that the horse needs feeding.\", \"analysis\": \"The realization that Mattie reciprocates his passion makes Ethan reckless. He is tortured by the happiness that lies outside of his reach. But the sled ride is not a carefully considered choice. Mattie and Ethan give in to passion, but the result is not freedom. Instead, they ruin their lives. The theme of illicit passion is not given a happy spin in Ethan Frome. When Mattie and Ethan succumb to it, they destroy themselves. Passion is not a liberator; Ethan and Mattie are not in control of their feelings. Passion is only another force that acts on man, robbing him of agency. The sled ride is a symbol for Wharton's conception of free will and fate, a conception shaped by Naturalism. Although Ethan has some power in steering the sleigh, the track carries them down on the final run. Ethan steers the sled to some extent, but gravity and the shape of the hill drive them down into the elm. Man's freedom exists within a very narrow range of options. In the opening, we already learned that Ethan had a terrible accident, and so the event seems all the more fixed. Wharton has been foreshadowing the accident all along. We also know that Ethan is still going to be alive at the time when the narrator arrives in Starkfield, and so we immediately know that their suicide attempt is going to be unsuccessful. The suicide attempt is the final and most terrible failed plan of Ethan Frome. It caps off a long string of aborted plans and frustrated wishes, and this time the consequences are tragic. Chapter 10: We are back with the narrator of the opening. He is entering Ethan Frome's house, and from afar he has heard the harsh sound of a woman complaining. In the kitchen two old women are sitting, one tall and severe, the other slight. The tall woman gets up to get supper on the table. The slight woman moves her head without moving her body; she is paralyzed. She has a witch-like stair and a nagging, terrible voice. Ethan introduces the women to the narrator: the tall woman is Zeena. The cripple is Mattie Silver. Later, the narrator is talking with the widowed Mrs. Hale . Mrs. Hale is surprised that Ethan invited the narrator in for the night. Not many go into the Frome home, on account of Ethan's pride. Mrs. Hale visits there one or two times a year. She tries to pick a day when Ethan is out, because she cannot bear to see the pain on his face. On the night of the accident, Zeena came right away to the minister's place, where the two of them had been taken. As soon as Mattie could be moved, Zeena had her brought back to the Frome farm. Mattie has been there ever since; she had nowhere else to go. Zeena has cared for them both for twenty years; somehow, she found the strength, even though at one time she believed she couldn't take care of herself. All of them are hard, bitter people. Mattie is hateful and difficult, and although Zeena usually bears it, at times the two of them quarrel viciously. At these times, the look on Ethan's face is heart-breaking. Mrs. Hale confides in the narrator that she thinks it would have been better if Mattie had died. The novel finishes with one of the more memorable closing lines of American literature, spoken by the widow with conviction: \\\"And I say, if she'd ha' died, Ethan might ha' lived; and the way they are now, I don't see there's much difference between the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down in the graveyard; 'cept that down there they're all quiet, and the women have got to hold their tongues.\\\" The narrator's outside view brings the Fromes' poverty into sharp relief. He remarks that even by the standards of the rural poor the Fromes' kitchen is squalid. And when we see Mattie Silver, now a paralyzed and hideous hag, we are reminded that she had nowhere else to go. Ethan Frome is partially a reaction against portraits of rural living that romanticized poverty and farming. Wharton shows again and again that poverty is soul-destroying. It has taken away Ethan's chances at happiness again and again. It forced Mattie to stay with the Fromes after the accident, and it has led to all of them ending life as stunted, hateful people. We see the theme of time as destroyer, waster. Before, the novel has given us the contrast between buildings as they were in the past and as they stand now; we have also seen the painful contrast between the young Ethan and the old lame man he becomes. But Mattie's transformation is the most horrible change we have seen. She is transformed from a lively, pretty girl to a hideous and bitter crone. Her re-entrance as an old cripple is one of the novel's most chilling moments. Zeena's transformation is an interesting and ambiguous development. Some have read it as showing that Zeena possessed untapped reserves of strength and compassion; however, this reading runs up against some significant counter-evidence. The first is the narrator's description of her: \\\"She had pale opaque eyes which revealed nothing and reflected nothing\\\" . Hardly the description of a saint. Zeena has hardened to fit her circumstances; Mrs. Hale says that Zeena is not the one who suffers most, because she no longer has time to suffer. Just as she was able to care for Frome's mother, she finds it in herself to care for Ethan and Mattie. But her care is not marked by compassion or tenderness; this is care that comes because there is no other choice. And given what Chapter 7 revealed about Zeena's character, her transformation can be read very darkly. She can now afford to care for Ethan and Mattie because she no longer needs to worry about losing Ethan. If her earlier hypochondria was a way of controlling Ethan, it is no longer necessary. He is lame and needs her; in a similar way, Mattie no longer poses any kind of threat. All is stable at the Frome farm; there is no longer any way for Zeena to lose control of the situation. We finish with the graveyard that made such an impression on Ethan in his youth. The tombs are more than a reminder of mortality; Mrs. Hale says that the three living at the farm are like people already dead. They will continue to live in this way for a while yet; Harmon Gow assured the narrator that the Fromes are a hardy breed, and Ethan will probably live to be a hundred. We are reminded of the tombstone that bore Ethan's name, recording how a previous Ethan had lived with his wife \\\"Endurance\\\" for fifty years. Those fifty years become a grim promise. Ethan must live on, continuing to eke out a living on his farm's poor soil. The theme of determinism finishes here, with three people trapped together for the rest of their lives. Ethan will stay at the farm because he has no choice; he is as trapped and lifeless as his ancestors in the Frome burial ground.\"}","chapter":"\n\nAt the kitchen door Daniel Byrne sat in his sleigh behind a big-boned\ngrey who pawed the snow and swung his long head restlessly from side to\nside.\n\nEthan went into the kitchen and found his wife by the stove. Her head\nwas wrapped in her shawl, and she was reading a book called \"Kidney\nTroubles and Their Cure\" on which he had had to pay extra postage only a\nfew days before.\n\nZeena did not move or look up when he entered, and after a moment he\nasked: \"Where's Mattie?\"\n\nWithout lifting her eyes from the page she replied: \"I presume she's\ngetting down her trunk.\"\n\nThe blood rushed to his face. \"Getting down her trunk--alone?\"\n\n\"Jotham Powell's down in the wood-lot, and Dan'l Byrne says he darsn't\nleave that horse,\" she returned.\n\nHer husband, without stopping to hear the end of the phrase, had left\nthe kitchen and sprung up the stairs. The door of Mattie's room was\nshut, and he wavered a moment on the landing. \"Matt,\" he said in a low\nvoice; but there was no answer, and he put his hand on the door-knob.\n\nHe had never been in her room except once, in the early summer, when\nhe had gone there to plaster up a leak in the eaves, but he remembered\nexactly how everything had looked: the red-and-white quilt on her narrow\nbed, the pretty pin-cushion on the chest of drawers, and over it the\nenlarged photograph of her mother, in an oxydized frame, with a bunch of\ndyed grasses at the back. Now these and all other tokens of her presence\nhad vanished, and the room looked as bare and comfortless as when Zeena\nhad shown her into it on the day of her arrival. In the middle of the\nfloor stood her trunk, and on the trunk she sat in her Sunday dress,\nher back turned to the door and her face in her hands. She had not heard\nEthan's call because she was sobbing and she did not hear his step till\nhe stood close behind her and laid his hands on her shoulders.\n\n\"Matt--oh, don't--oh, Matt!\"\n\nShe started up, lifting her wet face to his. \"Ethan--I thought I wasn't\never going to see you again!\"\n\nHe took her in his arms, pressing her close, and with a trembling hand\nsmoothed away the hair from her forehead.\n\n\"Not see me again? What do you mean?\"\n\nShe sobbed out: \"Jotham said you told him we wasn't to wait dinner for\nyou, and I thought--\"\n\n\"You thought I meant to cut it?\" he finished for her grimly.\n\nShe clung to him without answering, and he laid his lips on her hair,\nwhich was soft yet springy, like certain mosses on warm slopes, and had\nthe faint woody fragrance of fresh sawdust in the sun.\n\nThrough the door they heard Zeena's voice calling out from below: \"Dan'l\nByrne says you better hurry up if you want him to take that trunk.\"\n\nThey drew apart with stricken faces. Words of resistance rushed to\nEthan's lips and died there. Mattie found her handkerchief and dried her\neyes; then, bending down, she took hold of a handle of the trunk.\n\nEthan put her aside. \"You let go, Matt,\" he ordered her.\n\nShe answered: \"It takes two to coax it round the corner\"; and submitting\nto this argument he grasped the other handle, and together they\nmanoeuvred the heavy trunk out to the landing.\n\n\"Now let go,\" he repeated; then he shouldered the trunk and carried it\ndown the stairs and across the passage to the kitchen. Zeena, who had\ngone back to her seat by the stove, did not lift her head from her book\nas he passed. Mattie followed him out of the door and helped him to lift\nthe trunk into the back of the sleigh. When it was in place they stood\nside by side on the door-step, watching Daniel Byrne plunge off behind\nhis fidgety horse.\n\nIt seemed to Ethan that his heart was bound with cords which an unseen\nhand was tightening with every tick of the clock. Twice he opened his\nlips to speak to Mattie and found no breath. At length, as she turned to\nre-enter the house, he laid a detaining hand on her.\n\n\"I'm going to drive you over, Matt,\" he whispered.\n\nShe murmured back: \"I think Zeena wants I should go with Jotham.\"\n\n\"I'm going to drive you over,\" he repeated; and she went into the\nkitchen without answering.\n\nAt dinner Ethan could not eat. If he lifted his eyes they rested on\nZeena's pinched face, and the corners of her straight lips seemed to\nquiver away into a smile. She ate well, declaring that the mild weather\nmade her feel better, and pressed a second helping of beans on Jotham\nPowell, whose wants she generally ignored.\n\nMattie, when the meal was over, went about her usual task of clearing\nthe table and washing up the dishes. Zeena, after feeding the cat,\nhad returned to her rocking-chair by the stove, and Jotham Powell, who\nalways lingered last, reluctantly pushed back his chair and moved toward\nthe door.\n\nOn the threshold he turned back to say to Ethan: \"What time'll I come\nround for Mattie?\"\n\nEthan was standing near the window, mechanically filling his pipe while\nhe watched Mattie move to and fro. He answered: \"You needn't come round;\nI'm going to drive her over myself.\"\n\nHe saw the rise of the colour in Mattie's averted cheek, and the quick\nlifting of Zeena's head.\n\n\"I want you should stay here this afternoon, Ethan,\" his wife said.\n\"Jotham can drive Mattie over.\"\n\nMattie flung an imploring glance at him, but he repeated curtly: \"I'm\ngoing to drive her over myself.\"\n\nZeena continued in the same even tone: \"I wanted you should stay and fix\nup that stove in Mattie's room afore the girl gets here. It ain't been\ndrawing right for nigh on a month now.\"\n\nEthan's voice rose indignantly. \"If it was good enough for Mattie I\nguess it's good enough for a hired girl.\"\n\n\"That girl that's coming told me she was used to a house where they had\na furnace,\" Zeena persisted with the same monotonous mildness.\n\n\"She'd better ha' stayed there then,\" he flung back at her; and turning\nto Mattie he added in a hard voice: \"You be ready by three, Matt; I've\ngot business at Corbury.\"\n\nJotham Powell had started for the barn, and Ethan strode down after him\naflame with anger. The pulses in his temples throbbed and a fog was in\nhis eyes. He went about his task without knowing what force directed\nhim, or whose hands and feet were fulfilling its orders. It was not till\nhe led out the sorrel and backed him between the shafts of the sleigh\nthat he once more became conscious of what he was doing. As he passed\nthe bridle over the horse's head, and wound the traces around the\nshafts, he remembered the day when he had made the same preparations\nin order to drive over and meet his wife's cousin at the Flats. It\nwas little more than a year ago, on just such a soft afternoon, with a\n\"feel\" of spring in the air. The sorrel, turning the same big ringed eye\non him, nuzzled the palm of his hand in the same way; and one by one all\nthe days between rose up and stood before him...\n\nHe flung the bearskin into the sleigh, climbed to the seat, and drove up\nto the house. When he entered the kitchen it was empty, but Mattie's bag\nand shawl lay ready by the door. He went to the foot of the stairs and\nlistened. No sound reached him from above, but presently he thought he\nheard some one moving about in his deserted study, and pushing open the\ndoor he saw Mattie, in her hat and jacket, standing with her back to him\nnear the table.\n\nShe started at his approach and turning quickly, said: \"Is it time?\"\n\n\"What are you doing here, Matt?\" he asked her.\n\nShe looked at him timidly. \"I was just taking a look round--that's all,\"\nshe answered, with a wavering smile.\n\nThey went back into the kitchen without speaking, and Ethan picked up\nher bag and shawl.\n\n\"Where's Zeena?\" he asked.\n\n\"She went upstairs right after dinner. She said she had those shooting\npains again, and didn't want to be disturbed.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say good-bye to you?\"\n\n\"No. That was all she said.\"\n\nEthan, looking slowly about the kitchen, said to himself with a shudder\nthat in a few hours he would be returning to it alone. Then the sense\nof unreality overcame him once more, and he could not bring himself to\nbelieve that Mattie stood there for the last time before him.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said almost gaily, opening the door and putting her bag\ninto the sleigh. He sprang to his seat and bent over to tuck the rug\nabout her as she slipped into the place at his side. \"Now then, go\n'long,\" he said, with a shake of the reins that sent the sorrel placidly\njogging down the hill.\n\n\"We got lots of time for a good ride, Matt!\" he cried, seeking her hand\nbeneath the fur and pressing it in his. His face tingled and he felt\ndizzy, as if he had stopped in at the Starkfield saloon on a zero day\nfor a drink.\n\nAt the gate, instead of making for Starkfield, he turned the sorrel to\nthe right, up the Bettsbridge road. Mattie sat silent, giving no sign\nof surprise; but after a moment she said: \"Are you going round by Shadow\nPond?\"\n\nHe laughed and answered: \"I knew you'd know!\"\n\nShe drew closer under the bearskin, so that, looking sideways around his\ncoat-sleeve, he could just catch the tip of her nose and a blown brown\nwave of hair. They drove slowly up the road between fields glistening\nunder the pale sun, and then bent to the right down a lane edged with\nspruce and larch. Ahead of them, a long way off, a range of hills\nstained by mottlings of black forest flowed away in round white curves\nagainst the sky. The lane passed into a pine-wood with boles reddening\nin the afternoon sun and delicate blue shadows on the snow. As they\nentered it the breeze fell and a warm stillness seemed to drop from the\nbranches with the dropping needles. Here the snow was so pure that the\ntiny tracks of wood-animals had left on it intricate lace-like patterns,\nand the bluish cones caught in its surface stood out like ornaments of\nbronze.\n\nEthan drove on in silence till they reached a part of the wood where the\npines were more widely spaced; then he drew up and helped Mattie to get\nout of the sleigh. They passed between the aromatic trunks, the snow\nbreaking crisply under their feet, till they came to a small sheet\nof water with steep wooded sides. Across its frozen surface, from the\nfarther bank, a single hill rising against the western sun threw the\nlong conical shadow which gave the lake its name. It was a shy secret\nspot, full of the same dumb melancholy that Ethan felt in his heart.\n\nHe looked up and down the little pebbly beach till his eye lit on a\nfallen tree-trunk half submerged in snow.\n\n\"There's where we sat at the picnic,\" he reminded her.\n\nThe entertainment of which he spoke was one of the few that they had\ntaken part in together: a \"church picnic\" which, on a long afternoon of\nthe preceding summer, had filled the retired place with merry-making.\nMattie had begged him to go with her but he had refused. Then, toward\nsunset, coming down from the mountain where he had been felling timber,\nhe had been caught by some strayed revellers and drawn into the group by\nthe lake, where Mattie, encircled by facetious youths, and bright as\na blackberry under her spreading hat, was brewing coffee over a gipsy\nfire. He remembered the shyness he had felt at approaching her in his\nuncouth clothes, and then the lighting up of her face, and the way she\nhad broken through the group to come to him with a cup in her hand. They\nhad sat for a few minutes on the fallen log by the pond, and she had\nmissed her gold locket, and set the young men searching for it; and it\nwas Ethan who had spied it in the moss.... That was all; but all their\nintercourse had been made up of just such inarticulate flashes, when\nthey seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a\nbutterfly in the winter woods...\n\n\"It was right there I found your locket,\" he said, pushing his foot into\na dense tuft of blueberry bushes.\n\n\"I never saw anybody with such sharp eyes!\" she answered.\n\nShe sat down on the tree-trunk in the sun and he sat down beside her.\n\n\"You were as pretty as a picture in that pink hat,\" he said.\n\nShe laughed with pleasure. \"Oh, I guess it was the hat!\" she rejoined.\n\nThey had never before avowed their inclination so openly, and Ethan, for\na moment, had the illusion that he was a free man, wooing the girl he\nmeant to marry. He looked at her hair and longed to touch it again, and\nto tell her that it smelt of the woods; but he had never learned to say\nsuch things.\n\nSuddenly she rose to her feet and said: \"We mustn't stay here any\nlonger.\"\n\nHe continued to gaze at her vaguely, only half-roused from his dream.\n\"There's plenty of time,\" he answered.\n\nThey stood looking at each other as if the eyes of each were straining\nto absorb and hold fast the other's image. There were things he had to\nsay to her before they parted, but he could not say them in that place\nof summer memories, and he turned and followed her in silence to\nthe sleigh. As they drove away the sun sank behind the hill and the\npine-boles turned from red to grey.\n\nBy a devious track between the fields they wound back to the Starkfield\nroad. Under the open sky the light was still clear, with a reflection of\ncold red on the eastern hills. The clumps of trees in the snow seemed to\ndraw together in ruffled lumps, like birds with their heads under their\nwings; and the sky, as it paled, rose higher, leaving the earth more\nalone.\n\nAs they turned into the Starkfield road Ethan said: \"Matt, what do you\nmean to do?\"\n\nShe did not answer at once, but at length she said: \"I'll try to get a\nplace in a store.\"\n\n\"You know you can't do it. The bad air and the standing all day nearly\nkilled you before.\"\n\n\"I'm a lot stronger than I was before I came to Starkfield.\"\n\n\"And now you're going to throw away all the good it's done you!\"\n\nThere seemed to be no answer to this, and again they drove on for a\nwhile without speaking. With every yard of the way some spot where they\nhad stood, and laughed together or been silent, clutched at Ethan and\ndragged him back.\n\n\"Isn't there any of your father's folks could help you?\"\n\n\"There isn't any of 'em I'd ask.\"\n\nHe lowered his voice to say: \"You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for\nyou if I could.\"\n\n\"I know there isn't.\"\n\n\"But I can't--\"\n\nShe was silent, but he felt a slight tremor in the shoulder against his.\n\n\"Oh, Matt,\" he broke out, \"if I could ha' gone with you now I'd ha' done\nit--\"\n\nShe turned to him, pulling a scrap of paper from her breast. \"Ethan--I\nfound this,\" she stammered. Even in the failing light he saw it was the\nletter to his wife that he had begun the night before and forgotten\nto destroy. Through his astonishment there ran a fierce thrill of joy.\n\"Matt--\" he cried; \"if I could ha' done it, would you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Ethan, Ethan--what's the use?\" With a sudden movement she tore the\nletter in shreds and sent them fluttering off into the snow.\n\n\"Tell me, Matt! Tell me!\" he adjured her.\n\nShe was silent for a moment; then she said, in such a low tone that he\nhad to stoop his head to hear her: \"I used to think of it sometimes,\nsummer nights when the moon was so bright. I couldn't sleep.\"\n\nHis heart reeled with the sweetness of it. \"As long ago as that?\"\n\nShe answered, as if the date had long been fixed for her: \"The first\ntime was at Shadow Pond.\"\n\n\"Was that why you gave me my coffee before the others?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Did I? I was dreadfully put out when you wouldn't go to\nthe picnic with me; and then, when I saw you coming down the road, I\nthought maybe you'd gone home that way o' purpose; and that made me\nglad.\"\n\nThey were silent again. They had reached the point where the road\ndipped to the hollow by Ethan's mill and as they descended the darkness\ndescended with them, dropping down like a black veil from the heavy\nhemlock boughs.\n\n\"I'm tied hand and foot, Matt. There isn't a thing I can do,\" he began\nagain.\n\n\"You must write to me sometimes, Ethan.\"\n\n\"Oh, what good'll writing do? I want to put my hand out and touch you. I\nwant to do for you and care for you. I want to be there when you're sick\nand when you're lonesome.\"\n\n\"You mustn't think but what I'll do all right.\"\n\n\"You won't need me, you mean? I suppose you'll marry!\"\n\n\"Oh, Ethan!\" she cried.\n\n\"I don't know how it is you make me feel, Matt. I'd a'most rather have\nyou dead than that!\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish I was, I wish I was!\" she sobbed.\n\nThe sound of her weeping shook him out of his dark anger, and he felt\nashamed.\n\n\"Don't let's talk that way,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Why shouldn't we, when it's true? I've been wishing it every minute of\nthe day.\"\n\n\"Matt! You be quiet! Don't you say it.\"\n\n\"There's never anybody been good to me but you.\"\n\n\"Don't say that either, when I can't lift a hand for you!\"\n\n\"Yes; but it's true just the same.\"\n\nThey had reached the top of School House Hill and Starkfield lay below\nthem in the twilight. A cutter, mounting the road from the village,\npassed them by in a joyous flutter of bells, and they straightened\nthemselves and looked ahead with rigid faces. Along the main street\nlights had begun to shine from the house-fronts and stray figures were\nturning in here and there at the gates. Ethan, with a touch of his whip,\nroused the sorrel to a languid trot.\n\nAs they drew near the end of the village the cries of children reached\nthem, and they saw a knot of boys, with sleds behind them, scattering\nacross the open space before the church.\n\n\"I guess this'll be their last coast for a day or two,\" Ethan said,\nlooking up at the mild sky.\n\nMattie was silent, and he added: \"We were to have gone down last night.\"\n\nStill she did not speak and, prompted by an obscure desire to\nhelp himself and her through their miserable last hour, he went on\ndiscursively: \"Ain't it funny we haven't been down together but just\nthat once last winter?\"\n\nShe answered: \"It wasn't often I got down to the village.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" he said.\n\nThey had reached the crest of the Corbury road, and between the\nindistinct white glimmer of the church and the black curtain of the\nVarnum spruces the slope stretched away below them without a sled on its\nlength. Some erratic impulse prompted Ethan to say: \"How'd you like me\nto take you down now?\"\n\nShe forced a laugh. \"Why, there isn't time!\"\n\n\"There's all the time we want. Come along!\" His one desire now was to\npostpone the moment of turning the sorrel toward the Flats.\n\n\"But the girl,\" she faltered. \"The girl'll be waiting at the station.\"\n\n\"Well, let her wait. You'd have to if she didn't. Come!\"\n\nThe note of authority in his voice seemed to subdue her, and when he\nhad jumped from the sleigh she let him help her out, saying only, with a\nvague feint of reluctance: \"But there isn't a sled round anywheres.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is! Right over there under the spruces.\" He threw the\nbearskin over the sorrel, who stood passively by the roadside, hanging\na meditative head. Then he caught Mattie's hand and drew her after him\ntoward the sled.\n\nShe seated herself obediently and he took his place behind her, so close\nthat her hair brushed his face. \"All right, Matt?\" he called out, as if\nthe width of the road had been between them.\n\nShe turned her head to say: \"It's dreadfully dark. Are you sure you can\nsee?\"\n\nHe laughed contemptuously: \"I could go down this coast with my\neyes tied!\" and she laughed with him, as if she liked his audacity.\nNevertheless he sat still a moment, straining his eyes down the long\nhill, for it was the most confusing hour of the evening, the hour when\nthe last clearness from the upper sky is merged with the rising night in\na blur that disguises landmarks and falsifies distances.\n\n\"Now!\" he cried.\n\nThe sled started with a bound, and they flew on through the dusk,\ngathering smoothness and speed as they went, with the hollow night\nopening out below them and the air singing by like an organ. Mattie sat\nperfectly still, but as they reached the bend at the foot of the hill,\nwhere the big elm thrust out a deadly elbow, he fancied that she shrank\na little closer.\n\n\"Don't be scared, Matt!\" he cried exultantly, as they spun safely past\nit and flew down the second slope; and when they reached the level\nground beyond, and the speed of the sled began to slacken, he heard her\ngive a little laugh of glee.\n\nThey sprang off and started to walk back up the hill. Ethan dragged the\nsled with one hand and passed the other through Mattie's arm.\n\n\"Were you scared I'd run you into the elm?\" he asked with a boyish\nlaugh.\n\n\"I told you I was never scared with you,\" she answered.\n\nThe strange exaltation of his mood had brought on one of his rare fits\nof boastfulness. \"It is a tricky place, though. The least swerve,\nand we'd never ha' come up again. But I can measure distances to a\nhair's-breadth--always could.\"\n\nShe murmured: \"I always say you've got the surest eye...\"\n\nDeep silence had fallen with the starless dusk, and they leaned on each\nother without speaking; but at every step of their climb Ethan said to\nhimself: \"It's the last time we'll ever walk together.\"\n\nThey mounted slowly to the top of the hill. When they were abreast of\nthe church he stooped his head to her to ask: \"Are you tired?\" and she\nanswered, breathing quickly: \"It was splendid!\"\n\nWith a pressure of his arm he guided her toward the Norway spruces. \"I\nguess this sled must be Ned Hale's. Anyhow I'll leave it where I found\nit.\" He drew the sled up to the Varnum gate and rested it against the\nfence. As he raised himself he suddenly felt Mattie close to him among\nthe shadows.\n\n\"Is this where Ned and Ruth kissed each other?\" she whispered\nbreathlessly, and flung her arms about him. Her lips, groping for his,\nswept over his face, and he held her fast in a rapture of surprise.\n\n\"Good-bye-good-bye,\" she stammered, and kissed him again.\n\n\"Oh, Matt, I can't let you go!\" broke from him in the same old cry.\n\nShe freed herself from his hold and he heard her sobbing. \"Oh, I can't\ngo either!\" she wailed.\n\n\"Matt! What'll we do? What'll we do?\"\n\nThey clung to each other's hands like children, and her body shook with\ndesperate sobs.\n\nThrough the stillness they heard the church clock striking five.\n\n\"Oh, Ethan, it's time!\" she cried.\n\nHe drew her back to him. \"Time for what? You don't suppose I'm going to\nleave you now?\"\n\n\"If I missed my train where'd I go?\"\n\n\"Where are you going if you catch it?\"\n\nShe stood silent, her hands lying cold and relaxed in his.\n\n\"What's the good of either of us going anywheres without the other one\nnow?\" he said.\n\nShe remained motionless, as if she had not heard him. Then she snatched\nher hands from his, threw her arms about his neck, and pressed a sudden\ndrenched cheek against his face. \"Ethan! Ethan! I want you to take me\ndown again!\"\n\n\"Down where?\"\n\n\"The coast. Right off,\" she panted. \"So 't we'll never come up any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Matt! What on earth do you mean?\"\n\nShe put her lips close against his ear to say: \"Right into the big elm.\nYou said you could. So 't we'd never have to leave each other any more.\"\n\n\"Why, what are you talking of? You're crazy!\"\n\n\"I'm not crazy; but I will be if I leave you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Matt, Matt--\" he groaned.\n\nShe tightened her fierce hold about his neck. Her face lay close to his\nface.\n\n\"Ethan, where'll I go if I leave you? I don't know how to get along\nalone. You said so yourself just now. Nobody but you was ever good to\nme. And there'll be that strange girl in the house... and she'll sleep\nin my bed, where I used to lay nights and listen to hear you come up the\nstairs...\"\n\nThe words were like fragments torn from his heart. With them came the\nhated vision of the house he was going back to--of the stairs he would\nhave to go up every night, of the woman who would wait for him there.\nAnd the sweetness of Mattie's avowal, the wild wonder of knowing at\nlast that all that had happened to him had happened to her too, made the\nother vision more abhorrent, the other life more intolerable to return\nto...\n\nHer pleadings still came to him between short sobs, but he no longer\nheard what she was saying. Her hat had slipped back and he was stroking\nher hair. He wanted to get the feeling of it into his hand, so that it\nwould sleep there like a seed in winter. Once he found her mouth again,\nand they seemed to be by the pond together in the burning August sun.\nBut his cheek touched hers, and it was cold and full of weeping, and he\nsaw the road to the Flats under the night and heard the whistle of the\ntrain up the line.\n\nThe spruces swathed them in blackness and silence. They might have been\nin their coffins underground. He said to himself: \"Perhaps it'll feel\nlike this...\" and then again: \"After this I sha'n't feel anything...\"\n\nSuddenly he heard the old sorrel whinny across the road, and thought:\n\"He's wondering why he doesn't get his supper...\"\n\n\"Come!\" Mattie whispered, tugging at his hand.\n\nHer sombre violence constrained him: she seemed the embodied instrument\nof fate. He pulled the sled out, blinking like a night-bird as he passed\nfrom the shade of the spruces into the transparent dusk of the open. The\nslope below them was deserted. All Starkfield was at supper, and not a\nfigure crossed the open space before the church. The sky, swollen with\nthe clouds that announce a thaw, hung as low as before a summer storm.\nHe strained his eyes through the dimness, and they seemed less keen,\nless capable than usual.\n\nHe took his seat on the sled and Mattie instantly placed herself in\nfront of him. Her hat had fallen into the snow and his lips were in her\nhair. He stretched out his legs, drove his heels into the road to keep\nthe sled from slipping forward, and bent her head back between his\nhands. Then suddenly he sprang up again.\n\n\"Get up,\" he ordered her.\n\nIt was the tone she always heeded, but she cowered down in her seat,\nrepeating vehemently: \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\"Get up!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I want to sit in front.\"\n\n\"No, no! How can you steer in front?\"\n\n\"I don't have to. We'll follow the track.\"\n\nThey spoke in smothered whispers, as though the night were listening.\n\n\"Get up! Get up!\" he urged her; but she kept on repeating: \"Why do you\nwant to sit in front?\"\n\n\"Because I--because I want to feel you holding me,\" he stammered, and\ndragged her to her feet.\n\nThe answer seemed to satisfy her, or else she yielded to the power of\nhis voice. He bent down, feeling in the obscurity for the glassy slide\nworn by preceding coasters, and placed the runners carefully between its\nedges. She waited while he seated himself with crossed legs in the front\nof the sled; then she crouched quickly down at his back and clasped her\narms about him. Her breath in his neck set him shuddering again, and\nhe almost sprang from his seat. But in a flash he remembered the\nalternative. She was right: this was better than parting. He leaned back\nand drew her mouth to his...\n\nJust as they started he heard the sorrel's whinny again, and the\nfamiliar wistful call, and all the confused images it brought with it,\nwent with him down the first reach of the road. Half-way down there\nwas a sudden drop, then a rise, and after that another long delirious\ndescent. As they took wing for this it seemed to him that they were\nflying indeed, flying far up into the cloudy night, with Starkfield\nimmeasurably below them, falling away like a speck in space... Then the\nbig elm shot up ahead, lying in wait for them at the bend of the road,\nand he said between his teeth: \"We can fetch it; I know we can fetch\nit--\"\n\nAs they flew toward the tree Mattie pressed her arms tighter, and her\nblood seemed to be in his veins. Once or twice the sled swerved a little\nunder them. He slanted his body to keep it headed for the elm, repeating\nto himself again and again: \"I know we can fetch it\"; and little phrases\nshe had spoken ran through his head and danced before him on the air.\nThe big tree loomed bigger and closer, and as they bore down on it\nhe thought: \"It's waiting for us: it seems to know.\" But suddenly his\nwife's face, with twisted monstrous lineaments, thrust itself between\nhim and his goal, and he made an instinctive movement to brush it aside.\nThe sled swerved in response, but he righted it again, kept it straight,\nand drove down on the black projecting mass. There was a last instant\nwhen the air shot past him like millions of fiery wires; and then the\nelm...\n\nThe sky was still thick, but looking straight up he saw a single star,\nand tried vaguely to reckon whether it were Sirius, or--or--The effort\ntired him too much, and he closed his heavy lids and thought that he\nwould sleep... The stillness was so profound that he heard a little\nanimal twittering somewhere near by under the snow. It made a small\nfrightened cheep like a field mouse, and he wondered languidly if\nit were hurt. Then he understood that it must be in pain: pain so\nexcruciating that he seemed, mysteriously, to feel it shooting through\nhis own body. He tried in vain to roll over in the direction of the\nsound, and stretched his left arm out across the snow. And now it was as\nthough he felt rather than heard the twittering; it seemed to be under\nhis palm, which rested on something soft and springy. The thought of\nthe animal's suffering was intolerable to him and he struggled to raise\nhimself, and could not because a rock, or some huge mass, seemed to be\nlying on him. But he continued to finger about cautiously with his left\nhand, thinking he might get hold of the little creature and help it; and\nall at once he knew that the soft thing he had touched was Mattie's hair\nand that his hand was on her face.\n\nHe dragged himself to his knees, the monstrous load on him moving with\nhim as he moved, and his hand went over and over her face, and he felt\nthat the twittering came from her lips...\n\nHe got his face down close to hers, with his ear to her mouth, and in\nthe darkness he saw her eyes open and heard her say his name.\n\n\"Oh, Matt, I thought we'd fetched it,\" he moaned; and far off, up the\nhill, he heard the sorrel whinny, and thought: \"I ought to be getting\nhim his feed...\"\n\n\n*****\n\n\nTHE QUERULOUS DRONE ceased as I entered Frome's kitchen, and of the two\nwomen sitting there I could not tell which had been the speaker.\n\nOne of them, on my appearing, raised her tall bony figure from her seat,\nnot as if to welcome me--for she threw me no more than a brief glance\nof surprise--but simply to set about preparing the meal which Frome's\nabsence had delayed. A slatternly calico wrapper hung from her shoulders\nand the wisps of her thin grey hair were drawn away from a high forehead\nand fastened at the back by a broken comb. She had pale opaque eyes\nwhich revealed nothing and reflected nothing, and her narrow lips were\nof the same sallow colour as her face.\n\nThe other woman was much smaller and slighter. She sat huddled in an\narm-chair near the stove, and when I came in she turned her head quickly\ntoward me, without the least corresponding movement of her body.\nHer hair was as grey as her companion's, her face as bloodless and\nshrivelled, but amber-tinted, with swarthy shadows sharpening the nose\nand hollowing the temples. Under her shapeless dress her body kept its\nlimp immobility, and her dark eyes had the bright witch-like stare that\ndisease of the spine sometimes gives.\n\nEven for that part of the country the kitchen was a poor-looking place.\nWith the exception of the dark-eyed woman's chair, which looked like a\nsoiled relic of luxury bought at a country auction, the furniture was of\nthe roughest kind. Three coarse china plates and a broken-nosed milk-jug\nhad been set on a greasy table scored with knife-cuts, and a couple\nof straw-bottomed chairs and a kitchen dresser of unpainted pine stood\nmeagrely against the plaster walls.\n\n\"My, it's cold here! The fire must be 'most out,\" Frome said, glancing\nabout him apologetically as he followed me in.\n\nThe tall woman, who had moved away from us toward the dresser, took no\nnotice; but the other, from her cushioned niche, answered complainingly,\nin a high thin voice. \"It's on'y just been made up this very minute.\nZeena fell asleep and slep' ever so long, and I thought I'd be frozen\nstiff before I could wake her up and get her to 'tend to it.\"\n\nI knew then that it was she who had been speaking when we entered.\n\nHer companion, who was just coming back to the table with the remains\nof a cold mince-pie in a battered pie-dish, set down her unappetising\nburden without appearing to hear the accusation brought against her.\n\nFrome stood hesitatingly before her as she advanced; then he looked at\nme and said: \"This is my wife, Mis' Frome.\" After another interval he\nadded, turning toward the figure in the arm-chair: \"And this is Miss\nMattie Silver...\"\n\n\n*****\n\n\nMrs. Hale, tender soul, had pictured me as lost in the Flats and buried\nunder a snow-drift; and so lively was her satisfaction on seeing me\nsafely restored to her the next morning that I felt my peril had caused\nme to advance several degrees in her favour.\n\nGreat was her amazement, and that of old Mrs. Varnum, on learning that\nEthan Frome's old horse had carried me to and from Corbury Junction\nthrough the worst blizzard of the winter; greater still their surprise\nwhen they heard that his master had taken me in for the night.\n\nBeneath their wondering exclamations I felt a secret curiosity to know\nwhat impressions I had received from my night in the Frome household,\nand divined that the best way of breaking down their reserve was to let\nthem try to penetrate mine. I therefore confined myself to saying, in a\nmatter-of-fact tone, that I had been received with great kindness, and\nthat Frome had made a bed for me in a room on the ground-floor which\nseemed in happier days to have been fitted up as a kind of writing-room\nor study.\n\n\"Well,\" Mrs. Hale mused, \"in such a storm I suppose he felt he couldn't\ndo less than take you in--but I guess it went hard with Ethan. I don't\nbelieve but what you're the only stranger has set foot in that house for\nover twenty years. He's that proud he don't even like his oldest friends\nto go there; and I don't know as any do, any more, except myself and the\ndoctor...\"\n\n\"You still go there, Mrs. Hale?\" I ventured.\n\n\"I used to go a good deal after the accident, when I was first married;\nbut after awhile I got to think it made 'em feel worse to see us. And\nthen one thing and another came, and my own troubles... But I generally\nmake out to drive over there round about New Year's, and once in the\nsummer. Only I always try to pick a day when Ethan's off somewheres.\nIt's bad enough to see the two women sitting there--but his face, when he\nlooks round that bare place, just kills me... You see, I can look back\nand call it up in his mother's day, before their troubles.\"\n\nOld Mrs. Varnum, by this time, had gone up to bed, and her daughter\nand I were sitting alone, after supper, in the austere seclusion of\nthe horse-hair parlour. Mrs. Hale glanced at me tentatively, as though\ntrying to see how much footing my conjectures gave her; and I guessed\nthat if she had kept silence till now it was because she had been\nwaiting, through all the years, for some one who should see what she\nalone had seen.\n\nI waited to let her trust in me gather strength before I said: \"Yes,\nit's pretty bad, seeing all three of them there together.\"\n\nShe drew her mild brows into a frown of pain. \"It was just awful from\nthe beginning. I was here in the house when they were carried up--they\nlaid Mattie Silver in the room you're in. She and I were great friends,\nand she was to have been my bridesmaid in the spring... When she came\nto I went up to her and stayed all night. They gave her things to quiet\nher, and she didn't know much till to'rd morning, and then all of a\nsudden she woke up just like herself, and looked straight at me out\nof her big eyes, and said... Oh, I don't know why I'm telling you all\nthis,\" Mrs. Hale broke off, crying.\n\nShe took off her spectacles, wiped the moisture from them, and put them\non again with an unsteady hand. \"It got about the next day,\" she went\non, \"that Zeena Frome had sent Mattie off in a hurry because she had a\nhired girl coming, and the folks here could never rightly tell what she\nand Ethan were doing that night coasting, when they'd ought to have been\non their way to the Flats to ketch the train... I never knew myself\nwhat Zeena thought--I don't to this day. Nobody knows Zeena's thoughts.\nAnyhow, when she heard o' the accident she came right in and stayed with\nEthan over to the minister's, where they'd carried him. And as soon as\nthe doctors said that Mattie could be moved, Zeena sent for her and took\nher back to the farm.\"\n\n\"And there she's been ever since?\"\n\nMrs. Hale answered simply: \"There was nowhere else for her to go;\" and\nmy heart tightened at the thought of the hard compulsions of the poor.\n\n\"Yes, there she's been,\" Mrs. Hale continued, \"and Zeena's done for her,\nand done for Ethan, as good as she could. It was a miracle, considering\nhow sick she was--but she seemed to be raised right up just when the call\ncame to her. Not as she's ever given up doctoring, and she's had sick\nspells right along; but she's had the strength given her to care for\nthose two for over twenty years, and before the accident came she\nthought she couldn't even care for herself.\"\n\nMrs. Hale paused a moment, and I remained silent, plunged in the vision\nof what her words evoked. \"It's horrible for them all,\" I murmured.\n\n\"Yes: it's pretty bad. And they ain't any of 'em easy people either.\nMattie was, before the accident; I never knew a sweeter nature. But\nshe's suffered too much--that's what I always say when folks tell me how\nshe's soured. And Zeena, she was always cranky. Not but what she bears\nwith Mattie wonderful--I've seen that myself. But sometimes the two\nof them get going at each other, and then Ethan's face'd break your\nheart... When I see that, I think it's him that suffers most... anyhow\nit ain't Zeena, because she ain't got the time... It's a pity, though,\"\nMrs. Hale ended, sighing, \"that they're all shut up there'n that one\nkitchen. In the summertime, on pleasant days, they move Mattie into\nthe parlour, or out in the door-yard, and that makes it easier... but\nwinters there's the fires to be thought of; and there ain't a dime to\nspare up at the Fromes.'\"\n\nMrs. Hale drew a deep breath, as though her memory were eased of its\nlong burden, and she had no more to say; but suddenly an impulse of\ncomplete avowal seized her.\n\nShe took off her spectacles again, leaned toward me across the bead-work\ntable-cover, and went on with lowered voice: \"There was one day, about\na week after the accident, when they all thought Mattie couldn't live.\nWell, I say it's a pity she did. I said it right out to our minister\nonce, and he was shocked at me. Only he wasn't with me that morning\nwhen she first came to... And I say, if she'd ha' died, Ethan might ha'\nlived; and the way they are now, I don't see's there's much difference\nbetween the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down in the graveyard;\n'cept that down there they're all quiet, and the women have got to hold\ntheir tongues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":6560.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 9-10","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210422153145\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/ethan-frome\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-9-10","summary_text":"Ethan returns home and goes upstairs to help Mattie bring down her trunk. He finds her crying; she thought that he might have left for good, and that she was never going to see him again. He tries to comfort her, and helps her take her trunk down the stairs. At lunch he announces that he is going to take Mattie to the station himself. Zeena argues with him, but he insists vehemently that he'll be taking her. Claiming he has business in town, he plans to leave three hours before Mattie's 6 o'clock train. They set out at three, and Ethan takes advantage of the extra time to take Mattie on a long ride. They go to Shadow Pond, where he and Mattie enjoyed a church picnic together a few months earlier. Ethan takes Mattie down to a quiet spot in the woods. They talk sweetly to each other, more open in their affection than ever before. The pond, with its happy memories, becomes too painful. They return to the sleigh. As they ride on toward town Ethan asks what Mattie intends to do. Prospects aren't good, and though Mattie pretends she'll manage it seems clear that hard times are ahead of her. Mattie brings out the letter Ethan began to Zeena; she found it by accident. Ethan says, in anguish, that he can't leave the farm. But he asks Mattie if she would come with him if he could. She admits that she would, but their talk changes nothing. As they near the edge of town, Ethan persuades Mattie to come sledding with him; it's their last chance to go coasting down the hill. The find a sled and go down, despite the fact that it's twilight and the light is the most confusing of any time of day. The first trip down is exhilarating; Ethan steers well, and they reach the bottom safely. They climb up the hill and realize fully that soon they will never see each other again. Both begin to cry, unable to leave each other, telling each other that they can't bear to be apart. Mattie asks Ethan to take her down the hill again, straight into the big elm. She does not want to live without him. They get into the sled for a second ride down, Ethan in front this time. He won't be able to steer, but the track will carry them down straight into the tree. They go down the hill, but they don't die. Ethan comes to, disoriented. He is in unbelievable pain. He realizes he is holding Mattie; she, too, is still alive. He hears the horse whinnying up at the top of the hill, and he realizes that the horse needs feeding.","summary_analysis":"The realization that Mattie reciprocates his passion makes Ethan reckless. He is tortured by the happiness that lies outside of his reach. But the sled ride is not a carefully considered choice. Mattie and Ethan give in to passion, but the result is not freedom. Instead, they ruin their lives. The theme of illicit passion is not given a happy spin in Ethan Frome. When Mattie and Ethan succumb to it, they destroy themselves. Passion is not a liberator; Ethan and Mattie are not in control of their feelings. Passion is only another force that acts on man, robbing him of agency. The sled ride is a symbol for Wharton's conception of free will and fate, a conception shaped by Naturalism. Although Ethan has some power in steering the sleigh, the track carries them down on the final run. Ethan steers the sled to some extent, but gravity and the shape of the hill drive them down into the elm. Man's freedom exists within a very narrow range of options. In the opening, we already learned that Ethan had a terrible accident, and so the event seems all the more fixed. Wharton has been foreshadowing the accident all along. We also know that Ethan is still going to be alive at the time when the narrator arrives in Starkfield, and so we immediately know that their suicide attempt is going to be unsuccessful. The suicide attempt is the final and most terrible failed plan of Ethan Frome. It caps off a long string of aborted plans and frustrated wishes, and this time the consequences are tragic. Chapter 10: We are back with the narrator of the opening. He is entering Ethan Frome's house, and from afar he has heard the harsh sound of a woman complaining. In the kitchen two old women are sitting, one tall and severe, the other slight. The tall woman gets up to get supper on the table. The slight woman moves her head without moving her body; she is paralyzed. She has a witch-like stair and a nagging, terrible voice. Ethan introduces the women to the narrator: the tall woman is Zeena. The cripple is Mattie Silver. Later, the narrator is talking with the widowed Mrs. Hale . Mrs. Hale is surprised that Ethan invited the narrator in for the night. Not many go into the Frome home, on account of Ethan's pride. Mrs. Hale visits there one or two times a year. She tries to pick a day when Ethan is out, because she cannot bear to see the pain on his face. On the night of the accident, Zeena came right away to the minister's place, where the two of them had been taken. As soon as Mattie could be moved, Zeena had her brought back to the Frome farm. Mattie has been there ever since; she had nowhere else to go. Zeena has cared for them both for twenty years; somehow, she found the strength, even though at one time she believed she couldn't take care of herself. All of them are hard, bitter people. Mattie is hateful and difficult, and although Zeena usually bears it, at times the two of them quarrel viciously. At these times, the look on Ethan's face is heart-breaking. Mrs. Hale confides in the narrator that she thinks it would have been better if Mattie had died. The novel finishes with one of the more memorable closing lines of American literature, spoken by the widow with conviction: \"And I say, if she'd ha' died, Ethan might ha' lived; and the way they are now, I don't see there's much difference between the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down in the graveyard; 'cept that down there they're all quiet, and the women have got to hold their tongues.\" The narrator's outside view brings the Fromes' poverty into sharp relief. He remarks that even by the standards of the rural poor the Fromes' kitchen is squalid. And when we see Mattie Silver, now a paralyzed and hideous hag, we are reminded that she had nowhere else to go. Ethan Frome is partially a reaction against portraits of rural living that romanticized poverty and farming. Wharton shows again and again that poverty is soul-destroying. It has taken away Ethan's chances at happiness again and again. It forced Mattie to stay with the Fromes after the accident, and it has led to all of them ending life as stunted, hateful people. We see the theme of time as destroyer, waster. Before, the novel has given us the contrast between buildings as they were in the past and as they stand now; we have also seen the painful contrast between the young Ethan and the old lame man he becomes. But Mattie's transformation is the most horrible change we have seen. She is transformed from a lively, pretty girl to a hideous and bitter crone. Her re-entrance as an old cripple is one of the novel's most chilling moments. Zeena's transformation is an interesting and ambiguous development. Some have read it as showing that Zeena possessed untapped reserves of strength and compassion; however, this reading runs up against some significant counter-evidence. The first is the narrator's description of her: \"She had pale opaque eyes which revealed nothing and reflected nothing\" . Hardly the description of a saint. Zeena has hardened to fit her circumstances; Mrs. Hale says that Zeena is not the one who suffers most, because she no longer has time to suffer. Just as she was able to care for Frome's mother, she finds it in herself to care for Ethan and Mattie. But her care is not marked by compassion or tenderness; this is care that comes because there is no other choice. And given what Chapter 7 revealed about Zeena's character, her transformation can be read very darkly. She can now afford to care for Ethan and Mattie because she no longer needs to worry about losing Ethan. If her earlier hypochondria was a way of controlling Ethan, it is no longer necessary. He is lame and needs her; in a similar way, Mattie no longer poses any kind of threat. All is stable at the Frome farm; there is no longer any way for Zeena to lose control of the situation. We finish with the graveyard that made such an impression on Ethan in his youth. The tombs are more than a reminder of mortality; Mrs. Hale says that the three living at the farm are like people already dead. They will continue to live in this way for a while yet; Harmon Gow assured the narrator that the Fromes are a hardy breed, and Ethan will probably live to be a hundred. We are reminded of the tombstone that bore Ethan's name, recording how a previous Ethan had lived with his wife \"Endurance\" for fifty years. Those fifty years become a grim promise. Ethan must live on, continuing to eke out a living on his farm's poor soil. The theme of determinism finishes here, with three people trapped together for the rest of their lives. Ethan will stay at the farm because he has no choice; he is as trapped and lifeless as his ancestors in the Frome burial ground.","summary_length":456.0,"analysis_length":1207.0,"chap_int":10,"previous summary id":["chapter 9","chapters 8-9","chapter ix","chapter 9","chapter 9"],"previous chapter":["Back in the kitchen, Ethan finds Zeena reading a book about kidney problems. Mattie apparently is moving her trunk. Appalled that she is moving the heavy thing without manly aid, Ethan jumps up to go help her. He finds her crying in her room. She thought that Ethan wasn't going to see her off. Zeena calls to them that it's time for Mattie to be headed on with her ride. Ethan whispers in Mattie's ear that he plans to drive her. Zeena tells him he can't, and he defies her. They fight but he has his way. In a fury he readies the horse and hitches it to the sleigh. Ethan finds Mattie in his study. Zeena has gone to bed without saying a word to Mattie. Smiling, Ethan tells Mattie they can enjoy their drive together. Ethan takes the scenic route, and heads to Shadow Pond, where Ethan and Mattie had once shared a picnic lunch together. She had asked him to a town picnic; he had refused, but later joined her. They try to drink in ever moment with each other, and Ethan tries to discuss her future. Again, her situation is really desperate. She has no one else who loves her in the world. Ethan breaks down, telling her that he had tried to find a way to run away with her but couldn't. Mattie shows him that she found the letter he started to write to Zeena. Begging, Ethan asks Mattie if she would have run away with him if he'd asked her to. She admits she's fantasized about the very thing, almost since the first time she met him. Mattie asks Ethan to write to her, but he thinks writing would be a terribly poor substitute for the real thing. He asks if she will get married. She tells him he's the only one for her. Soon they are near the sledding spot. It's dark, but they decide to take a sled before they go to the train station. After the successful sled, Mattie begs Ethan for another ride. This time, she doesn't want them to make it back up to the top of the hill. Ethan accuses her of insanity. She says that the real insanity will come if she is separated from Ethan. Her sobs are intense and Ethan hold her and touches her hair. They kiss. The power of her suggestion to sled to the death takes him over. His horse is crying hungrily in the distance but he beckons Mattie to the sled. Ethan sits in the back of the sled in the steering position, and Mattie sits in the front seat. Suddenly, Ethan has an idea and they switch seats. Mattie wraps her arms around him... Then woooooosh again, and then - They kiss. And then - they crash into the big elm tree. Ethan is trying to look at the stars. He's suddenly very tired. A small animal is making noise near him. Overwhelmed by a desire to ease the little animal's pain, he fumbles around in the snow until he feels something hair. It's hair. Mattie's hair. He realizes that Mattie is the little animal making noise. She says his name. He says her name back and tells her he though he had hit the elm, and that he needs to feed the horse... Now on to the Epilogue.","That night, after Ethan is sure Zeena is asleep, he goes downstairs to his cold study to think about all that had happened that evening. He has the note that Mattie had written him earlier in the evening telling him not to trouble himself with the situation. The note was the only note Mattie had ever written him, and in a way, it is the first real sign of communication of her affection for him. Ethan lays down on the sofa and feels something poking his cheek. He realizes it is a cushion Zeena made for him and he throws it across the room. Ethan considers rebelling against Zeena, violating the rules of society, and divorcing her to run away with Mattie. He recalls the story of a man who left his wife by fleeing to the West with his lover and leaving his farm to his wife. Ethan thinks the plan is a good one and begins to write a note of explanation to Zeena. He realizes that money is a problem. He doesn't have money for train fare for himself and Mattie, and Zeena would not be able to get any money from the sale of the farm or mill. Mattie finds him sleeping in his study the next morning. He gets up and they begin the morning chores. At breakfast, Zeena confirms her decision of the previous night by telling Jotham that Daniel Byrne is going to pick up Mattie's trunk and take it to the train station. Ethan decides to ask Andrew Hale for the money owed him once again, but on the way he meets Mrs. Hale who is sympathetic towards him. He realizes that he can't ask for the money and must accept the reality of the situation. While he's home for lunch, Ethan defies Zeena and refuses to allow Jotham to drive Mattie to the train station, insisting that he drive Mattie himself. Zeena retires to her bedroom, and Mattie and Ethan begin their journey to the train station. Ethan tries to tell Mattie of his wish to run away with her, and she produces the note he'd written the night before that she'd found in his study. They confirm that their imagined love for each other is real. They arrive at the sledding hill and decide to make good on the plans they had to go sledding together. After they successfully coast down the hill once, they kiss good-bye. Because they don't wish to be separated, ever, they decide to commit suicide by sledding into the elm tree. As they start down the hill and approach the elm tree, Ethan has an ugly vision of Zeena's face that causes him to swerve the sled; but he resumes the course and steers the sled into the elm tree. As Ethan regains consciousness, his vision returns and he tries to determine if the star he is looking at is Sirius. As his hearing returns, he hears the sound of a small animal calling out in pain. He becomes aware that the sound is coming from under his hand, which is on Mattie's face in the snow. He hears his horse whinny and is reminded that the horse needs to be fed.","Arriving back home, where a sleigh has come to take away Mattie's trunk, Ethan enters the kitchen to find Zeena reading a book of medical advice. When he asks about Mattie, Zeena tells him that she is upstairs packing. Ethan climbs the stairs and enters her room, finding Mattie sitting on her trunk in the middle of the emptied room, sobbing. She confesses her fear that she will never see him again. He reassures her, pulling her close to him and placing his lips on her hair. They are interrupted by Zeena, who calls for the trunk to be hurried down. Ethan carries it downstairs to the sleigh, and as he and Mattie watch the horse and rider depart, Ethan resolves that he, not Powell, will drive Mattie to the train. At dinner, Ethan is unable to touch his food, while Zeena eats heartily. After the meal, Powell asks what time he should return to deliver Mattie. Ethan explains that he won't need to come to the farm at all, as Ethan himself will be delivering Mattie to the station. This sudden change of plans does not sit well with Zeena, who tells Ethan that he needs to attend to the stove in the spare bedroom. A bitter exchange ensues, and Ethan firmly insists on taking Mattie in spite of Zeena's protests. Filled with nostalgia and regret, Ethan prepares his horse for the journey. Returning to the house, he finds the kitchen empty; he eventually locates Mattie in his old study, where she explains that she had wanted to take one last look around. Zeena has retired to her bedroom after dinner without a single word of goodbye to Mattie. After casting one last glance around the kitchen, Mattie is ready to join Ethan, entering the sleigh and starting down the hill. Ethan decides to take Mattie the long way around, along Shadow Pond, in order to relive a handful of memories. Ethan stops the sleigh in a pine wood and helps Mattie down. As they walk together through the wintry landscape, they remember their encounter of the previous summer at a church picnic on this very spot, where Ethan found a lost gold locket of Mattie's. Lingering in the glow of their reminiscence, Ethan longs to reach out to Mattie and declare his affections openly, but she rises to go before he can make his move. They drive on under a setting sun, and Ethan asks Mattie about her plans for the future. She outlines a vague notion of finding work in a store. Ethan declares his devotion to her, and she responds by showing him his aborted letter of goodbye to Zeena, which he had left in his study and which Mattie had then found. Ethan is exhilarated by her discovery and asks if she has the same feelings for him that he does for her. In despair, she dismisses his question as useless, tearing up the note and casting the fragments into the snow. However, moments later, she quietly confesses her own love for him. Ethan explains the impossibility of his situation, and Mattie insists that he write to her. Worried that she will eventually marry, Ethan asserts that he would almost sooner see her dead, and Mattie tearfully agrees with his sentiment. As they drive, they come across a group of boys with sleds, which reminds them of their long-harbored plan to go sledding. Suddenly, Ethan proposes that they embark on their sledding adventure right away, reassuring Mattie that the hired girl can wait for them at the station. Sighting a sled beneath the Varnum spruces, they make their way over to it and climb aboard. They finish their first run smoothly, though they narrowly miss the elm that stands at the foot of the first slope. As they climb back up the hill together, Ethan is struck with the thought that these are their last moments in each other's company. At the top of the hill, Mattie breathlessly asks Ethan if this was the same place where he once saw Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum kiss each other, and she embraces him in a kiss of their own. As they say their goodbyes--still refusing to accept them as goodbyes--and kiss again, the church clock strikes five. Unable to bear the prospect of parting from Ethan, Mattie solemnly requests that Ethan steer the sled so they coast directly into the elm tree and die together. Ethan's initial astonishment quickly gives way to his own desire to escape a future without Mattie. Locked in a lover's embrace once again, Ethan holds Mattie close and feels her sobbing, as the train whistle sounds. The two pile onto the sled together, with Ethan sitting in front, and Ethan sets the sled into its fatal motion. As they hurtle down the hill, Ethan feels confident that they will hit the tree, but at the last moment he swerves unexpectedly, as he seems to see Zeena's malignant face before him. The sled glides off in a second of uncertainty before he rights it on its course again. They then hit the elm. Ethan, dazed from the impact, hears the faint noises of what he takes to be a small animal in pain, and he makes a weakened effort to attend to it. After removing a heavy mass from on top of him, he reaches out to feel what he discovers to be Mattie's hair and face. Rising to his knees, he bends down toward Mattie's face, seeing her eyes open and hearing her utter his name. He moans softly back to her. Hearing his horse whinny at the top of the hill, he is brought back to the world and the duties that face him there.","When Ethan arrives home, Daniel Byrne is at the door with his horse and sleigh, and Zeena is in the kitchen studying a book on kidney troubles. Ethan goes upstairs to help Mattie with her trunk. He has been in her room only once before, and now all the tokens of her presence are packed away. Mattie herself sits on the trunk, crying. Part of her concern is that she has been afraid she might never see Ethan again since he was not at home. Ethan insists on taking the trunk down himself, and Mattie helps lift it into the sleigh. Then Ethan promises to take Mattie to the train later in the day. At dinner, Zeena is cheerful and hungry. After eating, Ethan tells Jotham that he will take Mattie to the train himself. Zeena insists that Ethan stay and repair the stove for the hired girl, but Ethan angrily tells her he is taking Mattie. It is a tense moment, and Ethan is furious. As he goes to the barn to hitch up the horse, he remembers that a year earlier he went to the train to bring Mattie out to live with them. When Ethan returns to the house for Mattie, he finds her in his study. She explains that she is \"taking a look around,\" as if to remember everything. Zeena does not bother to say good-bye, for she has already gone upstairs. Ethan is rather merry as they hop into the sleigh and take off. As he drives, he turns giddy, presses Mattie's hand, and heads off to Shadow Pond. Mattie draws close to him. The landscape around them is decorative and inviting, but they ride in silence until they come to their secret spot. They walk to the edge of the pond and reminisce about a picnic that had enjoyed here the summer. She had lost her gold locket in the grass, and Ethan had found it, a fact that pleased them both. Ethan remembers that Mattie wore a pink hat that day. The couple sits on a log and comes close to openly avowing their affection for one another. There are things Ethan wants to say to Mattie, but this place of summer memories does not seem the proper spot. They go back to the sleigh and talk on the way to town. Mattie says she will work in a store, she feels stronger that she did when she tried that sort of work before. She will not ask her father's folks to do anything for her. Ethan says he would do something if he could, but he cannot. Mattie grows silent. He turns to her as if to unburden himself when she pulls out the letter he had written to Zeena the night before. Ethan is thrilled and pained; he asks her, \"If I could ha' done it, would you?\" Mattie says it is useless and tears the letter to shreds. He asks again, and she says she used to think of it, in summer. As they pass the farm, Ethan remarks that he is tied down, and there is nothing he can do. She wants him to write to her; but he sees no use and adds she will soon marry. He says, however, that he would rather see her dead than married to someone else. She says she wishes she were dead. Mattie begins to weep, and Ethan feels ashamed for his words. She says that no one has been as kind to her as Ethan. He says that may be true for the past, but there is nothing he can do for her now. Ethan and Mattie arrive in town at twilight and see some boys sledding. Mattie remarks that they were to have gone sledding last night. By the church and Varnum spruces, there are no coasters, so Ethan suggests that they take a ride right then. The hired girl at the station can wait. The sudden authority in Ethan's voice again subdues Mattie, and she goes along. They find a sled, and though it is dark, Ethan insists that he knows the slope even with his eyes closed. They shoot down the hill, and Mattie winces as they pass the elm. They get up to climb the slope, and Ethan asks Mattie if she was scared that he would run her into the elm. She tells him that she is never scared with him. As they climb, Ethan becomes boastful of his steering abilities. At the top of the slope, he guides Mattie to the spruce trees where he found Ned and Ruth kissing. Mattie flings her arms around Ethan and they kiss. She says good- bye, and he says he cannot let her go. Then she sobs and says she cannot let him go either. Mattie suggests that they take the sled down the slope one more time. She wants to drive into the elm tree and die with Ethan; then they will never be parted. At first, Ethan says she is crazy, but Mattie draws out the picture of his future miserable life without her. Ethan is torn. He wants to grab up Mattie's hair as if they were by the pond in August, but it is cold and he hears the train and the horse whinnying up the hill. Mattie insists and his \"instrument of fate.\" He gets the sled, and they climb on. He gets up again and insists that Mattie sit behind, not in front. She does not want to, but he says he wants her to hold him so she relents. He reconsiders and nearly changes his mind; but then he leans back to kiss Mattie as he hears the horse whinny again. They fly down the first descent, and then the second. As the elm quickly looms up in front of them, Mattie hugs Ethan. He tries to aim so they will hit the tree squarely and die quickly, but at the last moment, he remembers his wife's monstrous face and makes a movement to flick the image away. The sled swerves, but he moves it back into line with the elm. The air shoots past like \"millions of fiery wires,\" and then they hit the elm. When Ethan opens his eyes, he is looking at the stars in the sky. He closes his eyes again. All is still, except he can hear a twittering animal near him. The animal is in pain, and he can't move towards it, for he feels weighted by a rock. He then realizes that the animal is Mattie and that the softness under his hand is her face. He drags himself to his knees and over to Mattie. She opens her eyes and says his name. He says he thought they would certainly die. Then he thinks that he hears the horse again and knows that he should go and feed it.","Ethan returns to the house to find that the sleigh has come to take Mattie's trunk to the station and that Zeena is in the kitchen reading a medical book. He asks where Mattie is, and Zeena replies that she is probably bringing down her trunk. Ethan goes up to Mattie's room and finds her sobbing on the bed. He lays his hands on her shoulders and she confesses that she feared she would never see him again. He takes her in his arms and lays his lips on her hair. Zeena calls for them to hurry and bring the trunk. They lift the trunk into the sleigh. He tells Mattie that he will drive her to the train, in spite of Zeena's wish that Jotham should take her. At dinner, Ethan cannot eat. Zeena eats heartily, and once again there is a smile on her face. Jotham asks Ethan what time he should come for Mattie. Ethan tells him not to bother, as he will drive her. Zeena protests, on the grounds that Ethan needs to mend the stove in the spare room in time for the hired girl's arrival, but Ethan overrules her. Ethan harnesses the horse, remembering sadly the day he had made the same preparations in order to collect Mattie and bring her to the farm. When he returns to the house, he finds Mattie in his study, taking a last look around. She reports that Zeena, without saying goodbye, has gone upstairs suffering from shooting pains, and does not want to be disturbed. Ethan and Mattie get into the sleigh. Ethan drives off, taking a long way round, so tht they can pass Shadow Pond, a place that holds happy memories for them. When they arrive at a wood where they had a picnic, Ethan stops the sleigh and they walk around the area. They sit on a log, and Ethan reminds that this is the place where he found a gold locket she had lost. He longs to touch her and speak lovingly to her, but does not know how. She rises and suggests that they move on. Back on the road, Ethan asks Mattie about her plans. She says she will try to find work in a store. He reminds her that her health would not stand it. He tells her that he would do anything within his powers for her. She pulls out Ethan's note to Zeena, which he had abandoned and forgotten to destroy. Liberated by her broaching the subject of their being together, Ethan asks her if she would have agreed. But she declares that there is no point in thinking about it, tears up the note and throws it away. When he presses her, she admits that more than once, she had entertained the thought; the first time was at Shadow Pond. Ethan tells her regretfully that he cannot do a thing to help their situation. She tells him he must write to her. He believes that she will marry, and says he would rather she were dead. Sobbing, she agrees. Continuing on their journey, they come across a group of boys with sleds. Ethan reminds Mattie that they had intended to go sledding the previous night. Ethan suggests they should do it now. They find a spare sled under the Varnums' spruce trees, where he had caught up with her after the village dance . She sits in the sled and he takes his place behind her. She is worried that he will not be able to see properly in the fading light, but he boasts that he could go down the slope blindfolded. They go down the slope, and Ethan skilfully steers clear of the dangerous elm at the bottom. They walk back up the hill, and at the top, Mattie asks if this is where he caught Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum kissing. She flings her arms around him and kisses him passionately, bidding him farewell. He protests that he cannot let her go. They hear the church clock strike five, but agree that neither wants to go anywhere without the other. Then Mattie thinks of a plan that will ensure that they will never have to part. She asks Ethan to take her down the slope again and collide with the elm so that they die together. At first he dismisses the idea as crazy, but she points out that she does not want to leave him and is unable to manage on her own. Ethan thinks of the hated vision of the home and wife he is to return to, and the joy of knowing that Mattie felt about him the same way that he felt about her. Unable to tolerate going back home to Zeena, he and Mattie take their places on the sled and he sets it in motion. The sled only needs to follow the track to collide with the elm. As the big tree looms closer, he seems to see Zeena's twisted face thrust itself between him and his goal, and the sled glides off course. He rights it again, and they hit the elm. Ethan regains consciousness to a 'cheep' sound like a mouse in pain. Unable to tolerate the sound of a suffering animal, he feels around for the source of the sound. His hand finds Mattie's hair and face. He places his face close to hers, sees her eyes open, and hears her say his name. Then he hears his horse whinny, and remembers that he will need to be fed."],"next summary id":"chapters 9-10","next chapter":"Ethan returns home and goes upstairs to help Mattie bring down her trunk. He finds her crying; she thought that he might have left for good, and that she was never going to see him again. He tries to comfort her, and helps her take her trunk down the stairs. At lunch he announces that he is going to take Mattie to the station himself. Zeena argues with him, but he insists vehemently that he'll be taking her. Claiming he has business in town, he plans to leave three hours before Mattie's 6 o'clock train. They set out at three, and Ethan takes advantage of the extra time to take Mattie on a long ride. They go to Shadow Pond, where he and Mattie enjoyed a church picnic together a few months earlier. Ethan takes Mattie down to a quiet spot in the woods. They talk sweetly to each other, more open in their affection than ever before. The pond, with its happy memories, becomes too painful. They return to the sleigh. As they ride on toward town Ethan asks what Mattie intends to do. Prospects aren't good, and though Mattie pretends she'll manage it seems clear that hard times are ahead of her. Mattie brings out the letter Ethan began to Zeena; she found it by accident. Ethan says, in anguish, that he can't leave the farm. But he asks Mattie if she would come with him if he could. She admits that she would, but their talk changes nothing. As they near the edge of town, Ethan persuades Mattie to come sledding with him; it's their last chance to go coasting down the hill. The find a sled and go down, despite the fact that it's twilight and the light is the most confusing of any time of day. The first trip down is exhilarating; Ethan steers well, and they reach the bottom safely. They climb up the hill and realize fully that soon they will never see each other again. Both begin to cry, unable to leave each other, telling each other that they can't bear to be apart. Mattie asks Ethan to take her down the hill again, straight into the big elm. She does not want to live without him. They get into the sled for a second ride down, Ethan in front this time. He won't be able to steer, but the track will carry them down straight into the tree. They go down the hill, but they don't die. Ethan comes to, disoriented. He is in unbelievable pain. He realizes he is holding Mattie; she, too, is still alive.

He tells her that since he has work, she can leave the brothel. She tells him, however, that she will never leave. She is addicted to morphine and cannot find another job in the city because she will be found out to be a whore. Jurgis sees that she wants him to leave, so he does. Jurgis immerses himself in \\\"the world of ideas. Though he is only a hotel porter, he spends his interests and energy on learning about the socialist cause. One night, he is specifically invited to attend a dinner at the home of a man named Fisher, a man who had become a millionaire but gave it up to live in the heart of the city's slums. Fisher is \\\"one of the minds of the movement. Jurgis feels out of place at the dinner since he is just a common worker, and everyone else is a gentleman or lady. He takes a seat in the corner and listens to the conversations. The first debate of the evening begins between two of the Socialist Party members, a former professor named Nicholas Schliemann and a former itinerant preacher named Lucas. Schliemann comments that the final great battle of the socialist movement will be between the Socialist Party and the Catholic Church. Religion, he says, is an opiate of the masses and has no place in the future socialist world. He tells the group that religion is a fraud that perpetrates the imbalance of power. Lucas, a former evangelical preacher, attempts to defend the word of God, \\\"which is one long cry of the human spirit for deliverance from the sway of oppression. Lucas goes down a list of passages from the Bible and stories of Biblical figures that represent the tenets of socialism. His most ardent argument is for Jesus Christ whom he says \\\"denounced in unmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time\\\" and was crucified for upsetting the social order. He gives a long speech on the merits of Christianity as being harmonious with Socialism, and in the end, Schliemann accepts his proposal. A man named Maynard, an editor of an East Coast newspaper that denounced socialism, takes the chance to note how the two socialists cannot even agree on the meaning of the movement. The men then agree on a definition of the basics: \\\"that a socialist believes in the common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life; and, second, that a socialist believes that the means by which this is to be brought about is the class-conscious political organization of the wage-earners. This definition gives Schliemann the opportunity to begin a long speech in defense of socialism. He tells Maynard of how the socialist society would organize labor; a job for everyone with no desire for profit so that each man earned a wage commensurate with his work. He details how competition in society is a wasteful process that creates innumerable jobs and positions that do nothing but waste money and labor. Advertising is simply a \\\"science of persuading people to buy what they do not want. However, by those with the means of production take advantage of those that actually produce useful things. Schliemann details the advances of science, such as farming machines and dishwashing machines that make some menial labor unnecessary. This will free up labor to produce more meaningful products for society. In terms of creative capital, Schliemann details how each person with a creative impulse will be able to support himself through wages given by those that sought to reward his work. Socialism will rid the world of the negative waste of competition and give the world a positive moral stance on which to produce meaningful goods and services, he argues. Election Day comes a few hours after the dinner. Jurgis goes to the meeting hall with other Socialist Party members to hear the election results. The Socialist Party makes great gains all over the Midwest. In Chicago, the Socialist vote increases from 6700 to 47,000. All across the Midwest in towns large and small, there is a great numerical increase in the number of Socialist votes counted. In the end, the Socialist vote ends up as over four hundred thousand, \\\"an increase of something like three hundred and fifty per cent in four years. The Socialists rejoice at these numbers, but a speaker comes before the hall and warns the crowd against losing the momentum. He tells them that future elections will be difficult but that with perseverance they will overcome the Beef Trust and \\\"Chicago will be ours\", \"analysis\": \"As Jurgis leaves Marija's brothel, he is in danger of falling back into the same cycle of poverty and unemployment as before. By chance, he enters the Socialist Party rally and undergoes his most significant awakening. Some scholars have likened this awakening to a conversion experience for Jurgis. The conversion narrative is a fixture of much of modern Western literature. Based upon narratives that began appearing in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and which found their greatest popularity in Puritan and Evangelical literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these narratives generally focus around a specific time in which a character undergoes some kind of intense personal or intellectual change. Jurgis's conversion fits this pattern. Through no effort of his own, Jurgis transforms from a character that is at the whim of the horrors of the natural world around him to a person with agency and the ability to influence his life and the lives of others. This conversion is seen in the reappearance of the voices and noises inside of Jurgis's head. In the novel's previous chapter, these voices and noises, symbolic of the spark of life, were extinguished. This represented the mental and interior death of Jurgis, even if his physical self still exists. The return of these voices represents a resurrection. This shows how Jurgis can be considered a Christ-figure in the novel's narrative. The Socialist Party movement is a typical description of revolutionary movements in America during this time. As shown by the singing of the Marseillaise, the French national anthem written during the Revolution of 1789. Sinclair had used the scene of Jurgis at the meat packing plant owner's house to propose that the reader understand the developing class conflict in Chicago in terms of previous revolutionary activity. By singing this anthem, Sinclair firmly establishes the Socialist Party in America as in the lineage of the French Revolution. These final chapters of The Jungle shows a shift in Sinclair's narrative technique. From Chapter Two until Chapter Twenty-Eight, Sinclair uses a narrative arc, mostly of the demise of Jurgis and his family. This arc ends in Chapter Twenty-Eight and Twenty-Nine with Jurgis's conversion to Socialism. The remaining chapters of the novel move from a narrative to an explanatory style of writing. Sinclair uses the final chapters to explain the tenets and the merits of socialism to his reading audience. Scholars and critics have not always approved of this technique since it abandons the Naturalist mode of writing Sinclair established in the rest of the novel. The discussion between Lucas and Schliemann allows Sinclair to elaborate on the breadth of the socialist movement. Lucas's argument that Christianity can be fully reconciled with the political aspirations of socialism demonstrates the thinking of the Social Gospel movement. This movement, unofficially led by pastors and writers who often ministered in the country's working class slums, seeks to portray the Christian church as originally a socialist movement. Their goal is to reclaim the social message of the gospel and to support socialist political goals. Schliemann's arguments for socialism follow the more traditional intellectual explanation of the movement. Schliemann relies heavily on the arguments framed by Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto and Capital. The novel's ending has been another point of criticism from scholars and critics. The novel resolves with a victory, if not in actual votes than in momentum,  for the Socialist Party. Jurgis's narrative is never resolved beyond experiencing his spiritual and intellectual awakening, and the reader is unsure as to whether his life truly improved or if he remained subject to the forces of the natural world that caused his previous demise. The novel's closing chapters, critics have charged, resemble propagandist material more than literary achievement, a fault that some feel keeps The Jungle from achieving the literary ambitions that Sinclair proposed for the novel.\"}","chapter":"\n\nOne of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to\ngo and see Marija. She came down into the basement of the house to meet\nhim, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, \"I've\ngot work now, and so you can leave here.\"\n\nBut Marija only shook her head. There was nothing else for her to\ndo, she said, and nobody to employ her. She could not keep her past a\nsecret--girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were\nthousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would\nmeet one of them. \"And besides,\" Marija added, \"I can't do anything. I'm\nno good--I take dope. What could you do with me?\"\n\n\"Can't you stop?\" Jurgis cried.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I'll never stop. What's the use of talking about\nit--I'll stay here till I die, I guess. It's all I'm fit for.\" And that\nwas all that he could get her to say--there was no use trying. When\nhe told her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered\nindifferently: \"Then it'll be wasted here--that's all.\" Her eyelids\nlooked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was\nannoying her, that she only wanted him to go away. So he went,\ndisappointed and sad.\n\nPoor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life. Elzbieta was sick a\ngood deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the\nworse for their life upon the streets. But he stuck by the family\nnevertheless, for they reminded him of his old happiness; and when\nthings went wrong he could solace himself with a plunge into the\nSocialist movement. Since his life had been caught up into the current\nof this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life\nto him came to seem of relatively slight importance; his interests were\nelsewhere, in the world of ideas. His outward life was commonplace and\nuninteresting; he was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one\nwhile he lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his life was a\nperpetual adventure. There was so much to know--so many wonders to\nbe discovered! Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before\nelection, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry\nAdams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis\nwent, and met one of the minds of the movement.\n\nThe invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who\nhad given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the\nheart of the city's slums. He did not belong to the party, but he was\nin sympathy with it; and he said that he was to have as his guest that\nnight the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against Socialism,\nbut really did not know what it was. The millionaire suggested that\nAdams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject of \"pure food,\"\nin which the editor was interested.\n\nYoung Fisher's home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and\nweather-beaten outside, but attractive within. The room that Jurgis saw\nwas half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly\nvisible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a\nlog fire was crackling in the open hearth. Seven or eight people were\ngathered about it when Adams and his friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to\nhis dismay that three of them were ladies. He had never talked to people\nof this sort before, and he fell into an agony of embarrassment. He\nstood in the doorway clutching his hat tightly in his hands, and made a\ndeep bow to each of the persons as he was introduced; then, when he was\nasked to have a seat, he took a chair in a dark corner, and sat down\nupon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his forehead with\nhis sleeve. He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk.\n\nThere was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening\ndress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named\nMaynard. There was the former's frail young wife, and also an elderly\nlady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college\nstudent, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face. She only\nspoke once or twice while Jurgis was there--the rest of the time she sat\nby the table in the center of the room, resting her chin in her hands\nand drinking in the conversation. There were two other men, whom young\nFisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Schliemann; he\nheard them address Adams as \"Comrade,\" and so he knew that they were\nSocialists.\n\nThe one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of\nclerical aspect; he had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired,\nand had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation.\nHe traveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon\nhospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall.\nThe other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor when\nAdams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they resumed\nit after the interruption. Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound, thinking\nthat here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in the world.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands\nand bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a\nprofessor of philosophy--until, as he said, he had found that he was\nselling his character as well as his time. Instead he had come to\nAmerica, where he lived in a garret room in this slum district, and made\nvolcanic energy take the place of fire. He studied the composition of\nfood-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates his\nbody needed; and by scientific chewing he said that he tripled the value\nof all he ate, so that it cost him eleven cents a day. About the first\nof July he would leave Chicago for his vacation, on foot; and when he\nstruck the harvest fields he would set to work for two dollars and a\nhalf a day, and come home when he had another year's supply--a hundred\nand twenty-five dollars. That was the nearest approach to independence\na man could make \"under capitalism,\" he explained; he would never marry,\nfor no sane man would allow himself to fall in love until after the\nrevolution.\n\nHe sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far in\nthe shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the fire\non the hearth. He spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with the\nmanner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom in\ngeometry, he would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of\nan ordinary person rise on end. And when the auditor had asserted\nhis non-comprehension, he would proceed to elucidate by some new\nproposition, yet more appalling. To Jurgis the Herr Dr. Schliemann\nassumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake. And yet,\nstrange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he\ncould follow the argument nearly all the time. He was carried over the\ndifficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad\ncareer--a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man\nas a small part of it. He understood human institutions, and blew them\nabout like soap bubbles. It was surprising that so much destructiveness\ncould be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose\nof government was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation\nof ancient force and modern fraud. Or was it marriage? Marriage\nand prostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man's\nexploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a\ndifference of class. If a woman had money she might dictate her own\nterms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy--that is, the\nproperty-rights--of her children. If she had no money, she was a\nproletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject\nbecame Religion, which was the Archfiend's deadliest weapon. Government\noppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind,\nand poisoned the stream of progress at its source. The working-man was\nto fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in\nthis one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience--in short\nto all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism. The destiny of civilization\nwould be decided in one final death struggle between the Red\nInternational and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic\nChurch; while here at home, \"the stygian midnight of American\nevangelicalism--\"\n\nAnd here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively\ntussle. \"Comrade\" Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he knew\nonly the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience. And\nwhat was the use, he asked, of confusing Religion with men's perversions\nof it? That the church was in the hands of the merchants at the moment\nwas obvious enough; but already there were signs of rebellion, and if\nComrade Schliemann could come back a few years from now--\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said the other, \"of course, I have no doubt that in a hundred\nyears the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed Socialism, just\nas at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.\"\n\n\"I am not defending the Vatican,\" exclaimed Lucas, vehemently. \"I am\ndefending the word of God--which is one long cry of the human spirit for\ndeliverance from the sway of oppression. Take the twenty-fourth chapter\nof the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as\n'the Bible upon the Beef Trust'; or take the words of Isaiah--or of the\nMaster himself! Not the elegant prince of our debauched and vicious art,\nnot the jeweled idol of our society churches--but the Jesus of the awful\nreality, the man of sorrow and pain, the outcast, despised of the world,\nwho had nowhere to lay his head--\"\n\n\"I will grant you Jesus,\" interrupted the other.\n\n\"Well, then,\" cried Lucas, \"and why should Jesus have nothing to do with\nhis church--why should his words and his life be of no authority among\nthose who profess to adore him? Here is a man who was the world's first\nrevolutionist, the true founder of the Socialist movement; a man whose\nwhole being was one flame of hatred for wealth, and all that wealth\nstands for,--for the pride of wealth, and the luxury of wealth, and the\ntyranny of wealth; who was himself a beggar and a tramp, a man of the\npeople, an associate of saloon-keepers and women of the town; who again\nand again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth and\nthe holding of wealth: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures on\nearth!'--'Sell that ye have and give alms!'--'Blessed are ye poor, for\nyours is the kingdom of Heaven!'--'Woe unto you that are rich, for ye\nhave received your consolation!'--'Verily, I say unto you, that a rich\nman shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven!' Who denounced in\nunmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time: 'Woe unto you, scribes\nand pharisees, hypocrites!'--'Woe unto you also, you lawyers!'--'Ye\nserpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of\nhell?' Who drove out the business men and brokers from the temple with a\nwhip! Who was crucified--think of it--for an incendiary and a disturber\nof the social order! And this man they have made into the high priest of\nproperty and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the horrors\nand abominations of modern commercial civilization! Jeweled images are\nmade of him, sensual priests burn incense to him, and modern pirates of\nindustry bring their dollars, wrung from the toil of helpless women\nand children, and build temples to him, and sit in cushioned seats and\nlisten to his teachings expounded by doctors of dusty divinity--\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Schliemann, laughing. But the other was in full\ncareer--he had talked this subject every day for five years, and had\nnever yet let himself be stopped. \"This Jesus of Nazareth!\" he cried.\n\"This class-conscious working-man! This union carpenter! This agitator,\nlaw-breaker, firebrand, anarchist! He, the sovereign lord and master\nof a world which grinds the bodies and souls of human beings into\ndollars--if he could come into the world this day and see the things\nthat men have made in his name, would it not blast his soul with horror?\nWould he not go mad at the sight of it, he the Prince of Mercy and Love!\nThat dreadful night when he lay in the Garden of Gethsemane and writhed\nin agony until he sweat blood--do you think that he saw anything worse\nthan he might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria, where men march\nout with a jeweled image of him before them, to do wholesale murder for\nthe benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and cruelty? Do you not know\nthat if he were in St. Petersburg now, he would take the whip with which\nhe drove out the bankers from his temple--\"\n\nHere the speaker paused an instant for breath. \"No, comrade,\" said the\nother, dryly, \"for he was a practical man. He would take pretty little\nimitation lemons, such as are now being shipped into Russia, handy for\ncarrying in the pockets, and strong enough to blow a whole temple out of\nsight.\"\n\nLucas waited until the company had stopped laughing over this; then\nhe began again: \"But look at it from the point of view of practical\npolitics, comrade. Here is an historical figure whom all men reverence\nand love, whom some regard as divine; and who was one of us--who lived\nour life, and taught our doctrine. And now shall we leave him in the\nhands of his enemies--shall we allow them to stifle and stultify his\nexample? We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not\nquote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he\ntaught, and what he did? No, no, a thousand times no!--we shall use his\nauthority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his ministry, and we\nshall yet rouse the people to action!--\"\n\nLucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on\nthe table. \"Here, comrade,\" he said, with a laugh, \"here is a place for\nyou to begin. A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty thousand\ndollars' worth of diamonds! And a most unctuous and oily of bishops!\nAn eminent and scholarly bishop! A philanthropist and friend of labor\nbishop--a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of the\nwage-working-man!\"\n\nTo this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as\nspectators. But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark,\nsomewhat naively, that he had always understood that Socialists had a\ncut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were\ntwo active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were\nagreed about nothing at all. Would the two, for his enlightenment, try\nto ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the\nsame party? This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of\ntwo carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in\nthe common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing\nthe necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist believes that\nthe means by which this is to be brought about is the class conscious\npolitical organization of the wage-earners. Thus far they were at\none; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the co-operative\ncommonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven, which is\n\"within you.\" To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary step toward\na far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience. Schliemann\ncalled himself a \"philosophic anarchist\"; and he explained that an\nanarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence was the\nfree development of every personality, unrestricted by laws save those\nof its own being. Since the same kind of match would light every one's\nfire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every one's stomach,\nit would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the control of a\nmajority vote. There was only one earth, and the quantity of material\nthings was limited. Of intellectual and moral things, on the other hand,\nthere was no limit, and one could have more without another's\nhaving less; hence \"Communism in material production, anarchism in\nintellectual,\" was the formula of modern proletarian thought. As soon\nas the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society had been healed,\nthere would be established a simple system whereby each man was credited\nwith his labor and debited with his purchases; and after that the\nprocesses of production, exchange, and consumption would go on\nautomatically, and without our being conscious of them, any more than\na man is conscious of the beating of his heart. And then, explained\nSchliemann, society would break up into independent, self-governing\ncommunities of mutually congenial persons; examples of which at present\nwere clubs, churches, and political parties. After the revolution, all\nthe intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be\ncared for by such \"free associations\"; romantic novelists would be\nsupported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist\npainters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist\npictures--and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors\nand musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could\nfind no one to maintain him, he could support himself by working part of\nthe time. That was the case at present, the only difference being that\nthe competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to\nlive, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any\none would be able to support himself by an hour's work a day. Also the\nartist's audience of the present was a small minority of people, all\ndebased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the\ncommercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which\nwould result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare\nof competition, we could at present form no conception whatever.\n\nAnd then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann\nasserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour's\ntoil by each of its members. \"Just what,\" answered the other, \"would be\nthe productive capacity of society if the present resources of science\nwere utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may be sure it\nwould exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds inured to\nthe ferocious barbarities of capitalism. After the triumph of the\ninternational proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and\nwho can figure the cost of war to humanity--not merely the value of the\nlives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping\nmillions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle\nand parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the\nwar attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the\ndrunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial\nimpotence and the moral deadness? Do you think that it would be too much\nto say that two hours of the working time of every efficient member of a\ncommunity goes to feed the red fiend of war?\"\n\nAnd then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of\ncompetition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and\nfriction; the vices--such as drink, for instance, the use of which had\nnearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification\nof the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the\ncommunity, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the\nwhole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the\nmilliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and\nlackeys. \"You understand,\" he said, \"that in a society dominated by\nthe fact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of\nprowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power. So we have,\nat the present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the\npopulation occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent\noccupied in destroying them. And this is not all; for the servants\nand panders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the\njewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful members\nof the community. And bear in mind also that this monstrous disease\naffects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison penetrates\nthe whole social body. Beneath the hundred thousand women of the elite\nare a million middle-class women, miserable because they are not of the\nelite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath them, in turn,\nare five million farmers' wives reading 'fashion papers' and trimming\nbonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling themselves into\nbrothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin robes. And then\nconsider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like\noil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling! You have\nmanufacturers contriving tens of thousands of catchpenny devices,\nstorekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and magazines filled up\nwith advertisements of them!\"\n\n\"And don't forget the wastes of fraud,\" put in young Fisher.\n\n\"When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,\"\nresponded Schliemann--\"the science of persuading people to buy what they\ndo not want--he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house\nof capitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen\nhorrors to point out first. But consider the waste in time and energy\nincidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes\nof ostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use!\nConsider all the waste incidental to the manufacture of cheap qualities\nof goods, of goods made to sell and deceive the ignorant; consider the\nwastes of adulteration,--the shoddy clothing, the cotton blankets, the\nunstable tenements, the ground-cork life-preservers, the adulterated\nmilk, the aniline soda water, the potato-flour sausages--\"\n\n\"And consider the moral aspects of the thing,\" put in the ex-preacher.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Schliemann; \"the low knavery and the ferocious cruelty\nincidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing, the\nblustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and\nworrying. Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of\ncompetition--they are but another form of the phrase 'to buy in the\ncheapest market and sell in the dearest.' A government official has\nstated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter dollars\na year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not only\nmaterials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human\nstomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have\nbeen well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years\nbefore the proper time. Then again, consider the waste of time and\nenergy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would\ndo. There are a million or two of business firms in the country,\nand five or ten times as many clerks; and consider the handling and\nrehandling, the accounting and reaccounting, the planning and worrying,\nthe balancing of petty profit and loss. Consider the whole machinery\nof the civil law made necessary by these processes; the libraries of\nponderous tomes, the courts and juries to interpret them, the lawyers\nstudying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the hatreds\nand lies! Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and haphazard\nproduction of commodities--the factories closed, the workers idle,\nthe goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the stock\nmanipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the overstimulation of\nothers, for speculative purposes; the assignments and bank failures,\nthe crises and panics, the deserted towns and the starving populations!\nConsider the energies wasted in the seeking of markets, the sterile\ntrades, such as drummer, solicitor, bill-poster, advertising agent.\nConsider the wastes incidental to the crowding into cities, made\nnecessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates; consider\nthe slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital energies;\nconsider the office buildings, the waste of time and material in the\npiling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground! Then take\nthe whole business of insurance, the enormous mass of administrative and\nclerical labor it involves, and all utter waste--\"\n\n\"I do not follow that,\" said the editor. \"The Cooperative Commonwealth\nis a universal automatic insurance company and savings bank for all its\nmembers. Capital being the property of all, injury to it is shared\nby all and made up by all. The bank is the universal government\ncredit-account, the ledger in which every individual's earnings and\nspendings are balanced. There is also a universal government bulletin,\nin which are listed and precisely described everything which the\ncommonwealth has for sale. As no one makes any profit by the sale, there\nis no longer any stimulus to extravagance, and no misrepresentation; no\ncheating, no adulteration or imitation, no bribery or 'grafting.'\"\n\n\"How is the price of an article determined?\"\n\n\"The price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is\ndetermined by the first principles of arithmetic. The million workers in\nthe nation's wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the total\nproduct of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a bushel of\nwheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day. If we employ an arbitrary\nsymbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then the cost of\na bushel of wheat is fifty cents.\"\n\n\"You say 'for farm work,'\" said Mr. Maynard. \"Then labor is not to be\npaid alike?\"\n\n\"Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should\nhave millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners. Of course the\nwages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will\nhave to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of\nworkers is needed in any particular industry. That is precisely what is\ndone at present, except that the transfer of the workers is accomplished\nblindly and imperfectly, by rumors and advertisements, instead of\ninstantly and completely, by a universal government bulletin.\"\n\n\"How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?\nWhat is the labor cost of a book?\"\n\n\"Obviously it is the labor cost of the paper, printing, and binding of\nit--about a fifth of its present cost.\"\n\n\"And the author?\"\n\n\"I have already said that the state could not control intellectual\nproduction. The state might say that it had taken a year to write the\nbook, and the author might say it had taken thirty. Goethe said that\nevery bon mot of his had cost a purse of gold. What I outline here is\na national, or rather international, system for the providing of the\nmaterial needs of men. Since a man has intellectual needs also, he will\nwork longer, earn more, and provide for them to his own taste and in his\nown way. I live on the same earth as the majority, I wear the same kind\nof shoes and sleep in the same kind of bed; but I do not think the same\nkind of thoughts, and I do not wish to pay for such thinkers as the\nmajority selects. I wish such things to be left to free effort, as\nat present. If people want to listen to a certain preacher, they get\ntogether and contribute what they please, and pay for a church and\nsupport the preacher, and then listen to him; I, who do not want to\nlisten to him, stay away, and it costs me nothing. In the same way there\nare magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and flying\nmachines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of them.\nOn the other hand, if wage slavery were abolished, and I could earn some\nspare money without paying tribute to an exploiting capitalist,\nthen there would be a magazine for the purpose of interpreting\nand popularizing the gospel of Friedrich Nietzsche, the prophet of\nEvolution, and also of Horace Fletcher, the inventor of the noble\nscience of clean eating; and incidentally, perhaps, for the discouraging\nof long skirts, and the scientific breeding of men and women, and the\nestablishing of divorce by mutual consent.\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused for a moment. \"That was a lecture,\" he said with a\nlaugh, \"and yet I am only begun!\"\n\n\"What else is there?\" asked Maynard.\n\n\"I have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,\"\nanswered the other. \"I have hardly mentioned the positive economies\nof co-operation. Allowing five to a family, there are fifteen million\nfamilies in this country; and at least ten million of these live\nseparately, the domestic drudge being either the wife or a wage slave.\nNow set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the\neconomies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the\nwashing of dishes. Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing\nfor a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a day's\nwork, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied persons--mostly\nwomen to do the dish-washing of the country. And note that this is most\nfilthy and deadening and brutalizing work; that it is a cause of anemia,\nnervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of prostitution, suicide, and\ninsanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate children--for all of which\nthings the community has naturally to pay. And now consider that in each\nof my little free communities there would be a machine which would wash\nand dry the dishes, and do it, not merely to the eye and the touch,\nbut scientifically--sterilizing them--and do it at a saving of all the\ndrudgery and nine-tenths of the time! All of these things you may\nfind in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take Kropotkin's Fields,\nFactories, and Workshops, and read about the new science of agriculture,\nwhich has been built up in the last ten years; by which, with made soils\nand intensive culture, a gardener can raise ten or twelve crops in a\nseason, and two hundred tons of vegetables upon a single acre; by which\nthe population of the whole globe could be supported on the soil now\ncultivated in the United States alone! It is impossible to apply such\nmethods now, owing to the ignorance and poverty of our scattered farming\npopulation; but imagine the problem of providing the food supply of our\nnation once taken in hand systematically and rationally, by scientists!\nAll the poor and rocky land set apart for a national timber reserve, in\nwhich our children play, and our young men hunt, and our poets dwell!\nThe most favorable climate and soil for each product selected; the\nexact requirements of the community known, and the acreage figured\naccordingly; the most improved machinery employed, under the direction\nof expert agricultural chemists! I was brought up on a farm, and I know\nthe awful deadliness of farm work; and I like to picture it all as\nit will be after the revolution. To picture the great potato-planting\nmachine, drawn by four horses, or an electric motor, ploughing the\nfurrow, cutting and dropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a\nscore of acres a day! To picture the great potato-digging machine,\nrun by electricity, perhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field,\nscooping up earth and potatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks! To\nevery other kind of vegetable and fruit handled in the same way--apples\nand oranges picked by machinery, cows milked by electricity--things\nwhich are already done, as you may know. To picture the harvest fields\nof the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a\nsummer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to\neach place! And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system\nof independent small farming,--a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated\nwith a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o'clock\nin the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they\nare able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut\nout from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and\ninvention, and all the joys of the spirit--held to a bare existence\nby competition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too\nblind to see his chains!\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused a moment. \"And then,\" he continued, \"place\nbeside this fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of\nphysiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to\noverfeeding! And then again, it has been proven that meat is unnecessary\nas a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce than\nvegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more likely\nto be unclean. But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more\nstrongly?\"\n\n\"How would Socialism change that?\" asked the girl-student, quickly. It\nwas the first time she had spoken.\n\n\"So long as we have wage slavery,\" answered Schliemann, \"it matters not\nin the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to\nfind people to perform it. But just as soon as labor is set free, then\nthe price of such work will begin to rise. So one by one the old, dingy,\nand unsanitary factories will come down--it will be cheaper to build\nnew; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking machinery, and\nso the dangerous trades will be made safe, or substitutes will be found\nfor their products. In exactly the same way, as the citizens of\nour Industrial Republic become refined, year by year the cost of\nslaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually those who want\nto eat meat will have to do their own killing--and how long do you think\nthe custom would survive then?--To go on to another item--one of the\nnecessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political\ncorruption; and one of the consequences of civic administration by\nignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable diseases kill off\nhalf our population. And even if science were allowed to try, it could\ndo little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings\nat all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others. They\nare penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and\nthe conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors\nin the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers\nof contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness\nimpossible for even the most selfish. For this reason I would seriously\nmaintain that all the medical and surgical discoveries that science can\nmake in the future will be of less importance than the application of\nthe knowledge we already possess, when the disinherited of the earth\nhave established their right to a human existence.\"\n\nAnd here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again. Jurgis had noticed\nthat the beautiful young girl who sat by the center-table was listening\nwith something of the same look that he himself had worn, the time when\nhe had first discovered Socialism. Jurgis would have liked to talk to\nher, he felt sure that she would have understood him. Later on in the\nevening, when the group broke up, he heard Mrs. Fisher say to her, in\na low voice, \"I wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same things\nabout Socialism\"; to which she answered, \"I don't know--but if he does\nwe shall know that he is a knave!\"\n\n\nAnd only a few hours after this came election day--when the long\ncampaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold\nits breath, awaiting the issue. Jurgis and the rest of the staff of\nHinds's Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they\nhurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening.\n\nBut already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph\ninstrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns. When the\nfinal accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four\nhundred thousand--an increase of something like three hundred and fifty\nper cent in four years. And that was doing well; but the party was\ndependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and\nnaturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones\nwhich felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall\nbelieved that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight\nhundred thousand. Just such an incredible increase had actually been\nmade in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700\nin 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and\nnow it was 69,000! So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in, the\nmeeting was a sight to be seen. Bulletins would be read, and the people\nwould shout themselves hoarse--and then some one would make a speech,\nand there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more\nbulletins. There would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring\nstates, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana had gone from\n2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of Ohio from 4,800\nto 36,000! There were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic\nindividuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented\nincreases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26 to 260; Henderson,\nKentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14 to 208; Cleo,\nOklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin's Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to 296--and many\nmore of the same kind. There were literally hundreds of such towns;\nthere would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of\ntelegrams. And the men who read the despatches off to the audience were\nold campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the\nvote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy, Illinois, from 189 to\n831--that was where the mayor had arrested a Socialist speaker! Crawford\nCounty, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was the home of the \"Appeal\nto Reason\"! Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the\nanswer of labor to the Citizens' Alliance Movement!\n\nAnd then there were official returns from the various precincts and\nwards of the city itself! Whether it was a factory district or one of\nthe \"silk-stocking\" wards seemed to make no particular difference in the\nincrease; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders\nmost was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards.\nPackingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the\nspring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600.\nNow, only one year later, it was over 6,300--and the Democratic vote\nonly 8,800! There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had\nbeen actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state\nlegislature had been elected. Thus Chicago now led the country; it had\nset a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!\n\n--So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes\nwere fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every\nsentence. The orator had been the head of the city's relief bureau in\nthe stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him\nsick. He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his\nlong arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of\nthe revolution. \"Organize! Organize! Organize!\"--that was his cry. He\nwas afraid of this tremendous vote, which his party had not expected,\nand which it had not earned. \"These men are not Socialists!\" he cried.\n\"This election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will\nforget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and\nrest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled to-day,\nand our enemies will laugh us to scorn! It rests with you to take your\nresolution--now, in the flush of victory, to find these men who have\nvoted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize them and bind\nthem to us! We shall not find all our campaigns as easy as this one.\nEverywhere in the country tonight the old party politicians are studying\nthis vote, and setting their sails by it; and nowhere will they be\nquicker or more cunning than here in our own city. Fifty thousand\nSocialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership Democracy in the\nspring! And then they will fool the voters once more, and all the powers\nof plunder and corruption will be swept into office again! But whatever\nthey may do when they get in, there is one thing they will not do, and\nthat will be the thing for which they were elected! They will not give\nthe people of our city municipal ownership--they will not mean to do it,\nthey will not try to do it; all that they will do is give our party\nin Chicago the greatest opportunity that has ever come to Socialism\nin America! We shall have the sham reformers self-stultified and\nself-convicted; we shall have the radical Democracy left without a lie\nwith which to cover its nakedness! And then will begin the rush that\nwill never be checked, the tide that will never turn till it has reached\nits flood--that will be irresistible, overwhelming--the rallying of the\noutraged workingmen of Chicago to our standard! And we shall organize\nthem, we shall drill them, we shall marshal them for the victory! We\nshall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us--and Chicago\nwill be ours! Chicago will be ours! CHICAGO WILL BE OURS!\"\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":6559.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 31","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180407095842\/http:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-jungle\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-28-31","summary_text":"After getting his job, Jurgis goes once again to see Marija. He tells her that since he has work, she can leave the brothel. She tells him, however, that she will never leave. She is addicted to morphine and cannot find another job in the city because she will be found out to be a whore. Jurgis sees that she wants him to leave, so he does. Jurgis immerses himself in \"the world of ideas. Though he is only a hotel porter, he spends his interests and energy on learning about the socialist cause. One night, he is specifically invited to attend a dinner at the home of a man named Fisher, a man who had become a millionaire but gave it up to live in the heart of the city's slums. Fisher is \"one of the minds of the movement. Jurgis feels out of place at the dinner since he is just a common worker, and everyone else is a gentleman or lady. He takes a seat in the corner and listens to the conversations. The first debate of the evening begins between two of the Socialist Party members, a former professor named Nicholas Schliemann and a former itinerant preacher named Lucas. Schliemann comments that the final great battle of the socialist movement will be between the Socialist Party and the Catholic Church. Religion, he says, is an opiate of the masses and has no place in the future socialist world. He tells the group that religion is a fraud that perpetrates the imbalance of power. Lucas, a former evangelical preacher, attempts to defend the word of God, \"which is one long cry of the human spirit for deliverance from the sway of oppression. Lucas goes down a list of passages from the Bible and stories of Biblical figures that represent the tenets of socialism. His most ardent argument is for Jesus Christ whom he says \"denounced in unmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time\" and was crucified for upsetting the social order. He gives a long speech on the merits of Christianity as being harmonious with Socialism, and in the end, Schliemann accepts his proposal. A man named Maynard, an editor of an East Coast newspaper that denounced socialism, takes the chance to note how the two socialists cannot even agree on the meaning of the movement. The men then agree on a definition of the basics: \"that a socialist believes in the common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life; and, second, that a socialist believes that the means by which this is to be brought about is the class-conscious political organization of the wage-earners. This definition gives Schliemann the opportunity to begin a long speech in defense of socialism. He tells Maynard of how the socialist society would organize labor; a job for everyone with no desire for profit so that each man earned a wage commensurate with his work. He details how competition in society is a wasteful process that creates innumerable jobs and positions that do nothing but waste money and labor. Advertising is simply a \"science of persuading people to buy what they do not want. However, by those with the means of production take advantage of those that actually produce useful things. Schliemann details the advances of science, such as farming machines and dishwashing machines that make some menial labor unnecessary. This will free up labor to produce more meaningful products for society. In terms of creative capital, Schliemann details how each person with a creative impulse will be able to support himself through wages given by those that sought to reward his work. Socialism will rid the world of the negative waste of competition and give the world a positive moral stance on which to produce meaningful goods and services, he argues. Election Day comes a few hours after the dinner. Jurgis goes to the meeting hall with other Socialist Party members to hear the election results. The Socialist Party makes great gains all over the Midwest. In Chicago, the Socialist vote increases from 6700 to 47,000. All across the Midwest in towns large and small, there is a great numerical increase in the number of Socialist votes counted. In the end, the Socialist vote ends up as over four hundred thousand, \"an increase of something like three hundred and fifty per cent in four years. The Socialists rejoice at these numbers, but a speaker comes before the hall and warns the crowd against losing the momentum. He tells them that future elections will be difficult but that with perseverance they will overcome the Beef Trust and \"Chicago will be ours","summary_analysis":"As Jurgis leaves Marija's brothel, he is in danger of falling back into the same cycle of poverty and unemployment as before. By chance, he enters the Socialist Party rally and undergoes his most significant awakening. Some scholars have likened this awakening to a conversion experience for Jurgis. The conversion narrative is a fixture of much of modern Western literature. Based upon narratives that began appearing in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and which found their greatest popularity in Puritan and Evangelical literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these narratives generally focus around a specific time in which a character undergoes some kind of intense personal or intellectual change. Jurgis's conversion fits this pattern. Through no effort of his own, Jurgis transforms from a character that is at the whim of the horrors of the natural world around him to a person with agency and the ability to influence his life and the lives of others. This conversion is seen in the reappearance of the voices and noises inside of Jurgis's head. In the novel's previous chapter, these voices and noises, symbolic of the spark of life, were extinguished. This represented the mental and interior death of Jurgis, even if his physical self still exists. The return of these voices represents a resurrection. This shows how Jurgis can be considered a Christ-figure in the novel's narrative. The Socialist Party movement is a typical description of revolutionary movements in America during this time. As shown by the singing of the Marseillaise, the French national anthem written during the Revolution of 1789. Sinclair had used the scene of Jurgis at the meat packing plant owner's house to propose that the reader understand the developing class conflict in Chicago in terms of previous revolutionary activity. By singing this anthem, Sinclair firmly establishes the Socialist Party in America as in the lineage of the French Revolution. These final chapters of The Jungle shows a shift in Sinclair's narrative technique. From Chapter Two until Chapter Twenty-Eight, Sinclair uses a narrative arc, mostly of the demise of Jurgis and his family. This arc ends in Chapter Twenty-Eight and Twenty-Nine with Jurgis's conversion to Socialism. The remaining chapters of the novel move from a narrative to an explanatory style of writing. Sinclair uses the final chapters to explain the tenets and the merits of socialism to his reading audience. Scholars and critics have not always approved of this technique since it abandons the Naturalist mode of writing Sinclair established in the rest of the novel. The discussion between Lucas and Schliemann allows Sinclair to elaborate on the breadth of the socialist movement. Lucas's argument that Christianity can be fully reconciled with the political aspirations of socialism demonstrates the thinking of the Social Gospel movement. This movement, unofficially led by pastors and writers who often ministered in the country's working class slums, seeks to portray the Christian church as originally a socialist movement. Their goal is to reclaim the social message of the gospel and to support socialist political goals. Schliemann's arguments for socialism follow the more traditional intellectual explanation of the movement. Schliemann relies heavily on the arguments framed by Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto and Capital. The novel's ending has been another point of criticism from scholars and critics. The novel resolves with a victory, if not in actual votes than in momentum,  for the Socialist Party. Jurgis's narrative is never resolved beyond experiencing his spiritual and intellectual awakening, and the reader is unsure as to whether his life truly improved or if he remained subject to the forces of the natural world that caused his previous demise. The novel's closing chapters, critics have charged, resemble propagandist material more than literary achievement, a fault that some feel keeps The Jungle from achieving the literary ambitions that Sinclair proposed for the novel.","summary_length":777.0,"analysis_length":639.0,"chap_int":31,"previous summary id":["chapter 30","chapter 30","chapter 30","chapter 30"],"previous chapter":["Jurgis, now awakened by Socialism, returns to Elzbieta's house where he attempts to convince her of the system's merits. She is skeptical, but decides that anything that keeps Jurgis away from drink and makes him industrious is worth it. Jurgis begins looking for a job and fortunately comes to find one in a hotel as a porter. When Ostrinski learns of Jurgis's job, he tells him that the hotel owner is one of the most passionate Socialist Party members in the city. The hotel, owned by a man name Hinds, is a hotbed of Socialist activity. Hinds tells Jurgis of his own life and struggles and anytime he is faced with adversity he mutters: \"'Capitalism, my boy, Capitalism. Ecrasez l'Infame. The hotel employs a number of Socialist Party members and every night the employees get into intense arguments and debates with guests who defend systems of capitalism and individualism. Hinds explains how the Oil Trust, the Beef Trust, and the Railroad Trust actually own the country and the politicians. Some guests change their minds and attitudes towards socialism, and some do not. Jurgis begins to spend all his time and much of his money on spreading the Socialist cause, though he does occasionally fall into old habits of drink. At those times, he remembers, however, that it is a \"wicked thing to spend one's pennies for a drink, when the working-class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered. Jurgis attempts to convert his neighbors to socialism, though he makes many enemies and almost gets into a few fights during the process. The people tell Jurgis that socialism is \"paternalism,\" but Jurgis argues that by letting the capitalists rule the country and build the libraries and social structures, they are not allowing the workers to build their own country. Capitalism is true paternalism. Jurgis meets and hears a number of famous socialist speakers and writers. He meets the \"Little Giant,\" a little person who \"had written a veritable encyclopedia\" of Socialism. He hears a young author from California that had made a fortune selling books but that had never ceased to fight for the poor. He begins to read the \"Appeal to Reason,\" a tabloid newspaper that spreads the word of socialism through fantastical stories. Jurgis and the Socialist Party members distribute flyers and pamphlets telling the people of Packingtown what they can do to fight the Beef Trust when their strike fails. Feeling pressure, Mike Scully brings in the South Carolina \"pitchfork Senator\" to speak to the workers and to fight for the Republican Party. Jurgis stands up, however, and gives his own speech in the meeting, telling the crowd how he himself had been a part of the political machine that had bought votes and oppressed the voice of the people","The next morning, Jurgis goes to find Teta Elzbieta. He starts talking to her about socialism. Teta Elzbieta couldn't care less about whether or not socialism is right for the world. All she cares about is that Jurgis's new convictions mean that he plans to stay sober and look for a job. Once she figures that out, she encourages Jurgis's socialism as much as he wants. Jurgis starts looking for jobs at the various hotels in the neighborhood. A week later, Jurgis goes into the lobby of a hotel and approaches the owner. The owner asks Jurgis if he drinks. Jurgis says no, and the owner asks Jurgis if he is afraid of hard work. There's a job available for a night porter, but he'll have to do a lot of cleaning and hauling. Jurgis says that's fine. Jurgis tells Ostrinski he's gotten a job at a nearby hotel. Ostrinski is thrilled to hear that Jurgis has been hired at Hind's Hotel. Apparently, Tommy Hinds, the owner of this place, is a state organizer of the Socialist Party in Illinois. The next day, Jurgis informs his employer that he is also a socialist. Tommy Hinds shakes his hand. Tommy Hinds calls Jurgis \"Comrade Jurgis,\" and Jurgis calls his boss \"Comrade Hinds.\" Tommy Hinds frequently goes out to convince people to vote the socialist ticket to solve their troubles. He has a history as a union organizer and populist. After the 1896 election, in which Populist and Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan lost his campaign for president, Tommy Hinds gave up on the idea of wealth in private hands. Ever since then, he has been getting himself invited to every business meeting and church service in Chicago so that he can preach the value of socialism far and wide. Tommy Hinds's hotel is also a big source of pro-socialist political activity. His staff members are all socialists, and his chief clerk has been fighting the big railroad companies his whole life. His assistant clerk is Harry Adams, a smart guy from Massachusetts who moved down south to South Carolina and was horrified by the widespread illiteracy and poverty he found there. So he moved to Chicago and became a socialist. Oddly, the fact that this hotel is a socialist business doesn't mean it's not profitable. The hotel is inexpensive and gets plenty of out-of-towners looking for work in the stockyards who are too poor to afford lodging elsewhere. Tommy Hinds works to convert all of these new guys to the cause. He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards. Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him to get personal - he just wants Jurgis to explain the bad business and hygiene practices at these meatpacking plants. Tommy Hinds explains that it's not just the Beef Trust ; all business in the US is dominated by just a few super-powerful companies. The Standard Oil Company controls the price of oil and the Steel Trust overcharges on nails, and so on. Jurgis learns everything he needs to know about socialism working for Tommy Hinds. Because he has such faith in Tommy Hinds's views, Jurgis works harder and with more loyalty than he ever would have for the meatpackers. Jurgis does his best to convert his acquaintances to socialism. Still, he often finds himself almost getting into fights. Even though the benefits of socialism seem obvious to Jurgis, a lot of working people resist. They claim to prefer individualism, and resist the kind of control on their money that socialism would mean. Jurgis feels that these people are forgetting that the people who really benefit from individualism and capitalism are the steel, oil, and meat magnates. It's never the working guy who profits from free enterprise. Jurgis starts to read newspapers and to learn about America's history so that he can convince people to join the socialist cause. At socialist meetings, Jurgis meets a range of extraordinary organizers and great people who have sacrificed so much to join the cause of the working man. Jurgis becomes a regular reader of Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper with lots of tidbits about how the American working man suffers. They begin to distribute this newspaper in Packingtown after the union lost the strike there, so that workers can take hope. Jurgis also hands out Appeal to Reason in the stockyards in an effort to undo the damage he did when he was part of Mike Scully's political machine. The socialists are gaining a real political foothold in Packingtown, and Mike Scully and his political machine are on the run.","With his newfound faith and fire, Jurgis goes to see Elzbieta. She is not interested in his politics but notices the spark of industry in his eyes and tolerates his rhetoric. Soon Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a hotel, a hotel that, coincidentally, is a political hotbed of socialism. The proprietor of the hotel, Tommy Hinds, and his staff educate Jurgis and others in the ways and means of socialism. Gradually, socialism becomes the root of Jurgis' existence.","Jurgis visits Teta Elzbieta to tell her about socialism. She is happy to hear that he wishes to work and help support the family. She even agrees to attend socialist political meetings with him from time to time. Jurgis finds a job as a porter in a small hotel that pays thirty dollars a month plus board. Ostrinski informs Jurgis that his new boss, Tommy Hinds, is actually a state organizer for the socialist party and a well-known socialist speaker. Hinds is overjoyed to find that Jurgis is a comrade. Hinds never tires of preaching socialism in his hotel and elsewhere. Socialists flock to the hotel, so the radical philosophy of the proprietor does not hurt the business he owns. Hinds often urges Jurgis to detail the horrendous filth of the meat-packing plants along with the real recipes for tinned meats and sausages. Jurgis takes up the socialist cause with a passion. He endeavors to read newspapers, including The Appeal to Reason, and learn all about the political and economic systems of power in America. He becomes angry and frustrated when he cannot sway people to socialism"],"next summary id":"chapter 31","next chapter":"After getting his job, Jurgis goes once again to see Marija. He tells her that since he has work, she can leave the brothel. She tells him, however, that she will never leave. She is addicted to morphine and cannot find another job in the city because she will be found out to be a whore. Jurgis sees that she wants him to leave, so he does. Jurgis immerses himself in \"the world of ideas. Though he is only a hotel porter, he spends his interests and energy on learning about the socialist cause. One night, he is specifically invited to attend a dinner at the home of a man named Fisher, a man who had become a millionaire but gave it up to live in the heart of the city's slums. Fisher is \"one of the minds of the movement. Jurgis feels out of place at the dinner since he is just a common worker, and everyone else is a gentleman or lady. He takes a seat in the corner and listens to the conversations. The first debate of the evening begins between two of the Socialist Party members, a former professor named Nicholas Schliemann and a former itinerant preacher named Lucas. Schliemann comments that the final great battle of the socialist movement will be between the Socialist Party and the Catholic Church. Religion, he says, is an opiate of the masses and has no place in the future socialist world. He tells the group that religion is a fraud that perpetrates the imbalance of power. Lucas, a former evangelical preacher, attempts to defend the word of God, \"which is one long cry of the human spirit for deliverance from the sway of oppression. Lucas goes down a list of passages from the Bible and stories of Biblical figures that represent the tenets of socialism. His most ardent argument is for Jesus Christ whom he says \"denounced in unmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time\" and was crucified for upsetting the social order. He gives a long speech on the merits of Christianity as being harmonious with Socialism, and in the end, Schliemann accepts his proposal. A man named Maynard, an editor of an East Coast newspaper that denounced socialism, takes the chance to note how the two socialists cannot even agree on the meaning of the movement. The men then agree on a definition of the basics: \"that a socialist believes in the common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life; and, second, that a socialist believes that the means by which this is to be brought about is the class-conscious political organization of the wage-earners. This definition gives Schliemann the opportunity to begin a long speech in defense of socialism. He tells Maynard of how the socialist society would organize labor; a job for everyone with no desire for profit so that each man earned a wage commensurate with his work. He details how competition in society is a wasteful process that creates innumerable jobs and positions that do nothing but waste money and labor. Advertising is simply a \"science of persuading people to buy what they do not want. However, by those with the means of production take advantage of those that actually produce useful things. Schliemann details the advances of science, such as farming machines and dishwashing machines that make some menial labor unnecessary. This will free up labor to produce more meaningful products for society. In terms of creative capital, Schliemann details how each person with a creative impulse will be able to support himself through wages given by those that sought to reward his work. Socialism will rid the world of the negative waste of competition and give the world a positive moral stance on which to produce meaningful goods and services, he argues. Election Day comes a few hours after the dinner. Jurgis goes to the meeting hall with other Socialist Party members to hear the election results. The Socialist Party makes great gains all over the Midwest. In Chicago, the Socialist vote increases from 6700 to 47,000. All across the Midwest in towns large and small, there is a great numerical increase in the number of Socialist votes counted. In the end, the Socialist vote ends up as over four hundred thousand, \"an increase of something like three hundred and fifty per cent in four years. The Socialists rejoice at these numbers, but a speaker comes before the hall and warns the crowd against losing the momentum. He tells them that future elections will be difficult but that with perseverance they will overcome the Beef Trust and \"Chicago will be ours"}

He wants to tell her that she can quit being a prostitute. Jurgis will support the family. Marija says she can't. She's no good - she takes morphine, and she can't stop. Back at home, Teta Elzbieta is sick often, and the kids are wild and don't obey Jurgis. Still, Jurgis stands by them as best he can. The night before the election, Jurgis is invited to meet a bunch of Socialist Party leaders. Jurgis goes with the assistant clerk at Hinds's hotel, Harry Adams. There is an editor at the gathering. This man is Mr. Maynard, and he does not approve of socialism. Yet he also doesn't really understand what it is. The host of the party is Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who gave up all of his money to help improve the lives of the poor. Jurgis is embarrassed once he arrives, because he doesn't know how to talk to such educated people. Mr. Lucas is a preacher and evangelist, and Nicholas Schliemann is a former philosophy professor and nutritionist. Schliemann is originally from Switzerland. He has his own system for living under capitalism: he earns money working the fields over the summer and uses that money to buy a precise, scientific amount of food to keep him going the rest of the year. Jurgis walks in on an argument between Lucas and Schliemann on the value of religion to the socialist cause. Lucas believes wholeheartedly in using the Bible to preach about the redistribution of wealth. He points out that Jesus stood against the pride, greed, and luxury that wealth brings. Was it not Jesus who said, in the Sermon on the Mount: \\\"Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of Heaven\\\" ? Lucas keeps going on and on about Jesus as the first truly class-conscious man. Schliemann asks how they can feel free to use the Bible to preach this message when, right now, Christian bishops are accumulating huge wealth on the backs of the working man. Mr. Maynard, the east cost magazine editor, asks how it can be that two socialists disagree so actively about what direction to take the party? Lucas believes that socialism is a tool to creating a new promised land on Earth, New Jerusalem. Schliemann wants to see the centralization of all factories and private property, along with absolute freedom in thought and artistic production. Schliemann thinks this would lead to the natural development of communities based on like-minded people who choose to live and associate with one another. They would have so much more leisure time if they didn't have to compete with one another for work and there would be real time to devote to art and writing. Mr. Maynard wants to know how a society could possibly get by while demanding so little work from its members. Schliemann points out that capitalism wastes a lot of work on competition and strife between companies. If there was no concern about improving your standard of living, if everyone had enough to get by all right, the average worker would be much less stressed out and overwhelmed. After all, look how much each company spends on advertising! Without competition, there would be no need for marketing or for lying about the value of goods. Under this system, prices could be a lot lower because there would be no profit attached - a book would cost as much as necessary to cover production and no more. Schliemann doesn't mean that everyone will get exactly the same things - some people will work harder than others, and some will work less. Thus, some will get more than others. Still, everyone will be rewarded according to his efforts, and no one will be left behind. After the revolution, all of the social ills of ignorance, malnourishment of children, prostitution, and homelessness will be totally eliminated. Once labor is no longer figured into the cost of production, people won't have an incentive to do unpleasant work. In other words, let's say you were looking at two jobs, and one involved slaughtering cows and one involved growing vegetables. You would probably pick the second one unless there you got paid a lot more for the first one. But if all labor costs exactly the same thing - if you are paid according to how much you work, no matter what you are making - then there would be no reason ever to pursue a job you really, truly hated. This is why Schliemann feels that socialism will mean the end to unsafe labor practices: because factories will have to attract people to work for them. The power will all be on the side of the worker, not the factory owner. Schliemann predicts that this shift of power will also mean the end to the meatpacking industry as a whole. No one is going to choose to be surrounded by many, many slaughtered animals. In Schliemann's vision of a future world, we'll all be vegetarians. Jurgis overhears two women comment that Schliemann's speech must have converted Mr. Maynard to their cause. If not, then they'll know Mr. Maynard is a fool. The next day is Election Day. Jurgis hurries to a Socialist Party gathering to hear the results. The returns show that, across the board, there are more and more people turning out to vote for a socialist ticket. No city in the country is more actively socialist than Chicago. A speaker addresses the crowd: they must continue to organize! This is their opportunity! They must keep up their momentum! Chicago will be socialist!\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"\n\nOne of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to\ngo and see Marija. She came down into the basement of the house to meet\nhim, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, \"I've\ngot work now, and so you can leave here.\"\n\nBut Marija only shook her head. There was nothing else for her to\ndo, she said, and nobody to employ her. She could not keep her past a\nsecret--girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were\nthousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would\nmeet one of them. \"And besides,\" Marija added, \"I can't do anything. I'm\nno good--I take dope. What could you do with me?\"\n\n\"Can't you stop?\" Jurgis cried.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I'll never stop. What's the use of talking about\nit--I'll stay here till I die, I guess. It's all I'm fit for.\" And that\nwas all that he could get her to say--there was no use trying. When\nhe told her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered\nindifferently: \"Then it'll be wasted here--that's all.\" Her eyelids\nlooked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was\nannoying her, that she only wanted him to go away. So he went,\ndisappointed and sad.\n\nPoor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life. Elzbieta was sick a\ngood deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the\nworse for their life upon the streets. But he stuck by the family\nnevertheless, for they reminded him of his old happiness; and when\nthings went wrong he could solace himself with a plunge into the\nSocialist movement. Since his life had been caught up into the current\nof this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life\nto him came to seem of relatively slight importance; his interests were\nelsewhere, in the world of ideas. His outward life was commonplace and\nuninteresting; he was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one\nwhile he lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his life was a\nperpetual adventure. There was so much to know--so many wonders to\nbe discovered! Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before\nelection, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry\nAdams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis\nwent, and met one of the minds of the movement.\n\nThe invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who\nhad given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the\nheart of the city's slums. He did not belong to the party, but he was\nin sympathy with it; and he said that he was to have as his guest that\nnight the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against Socialism,\nbut really did not know what it was. The millionaire suggested that\nAdams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject of \"pure food,\"\nin which the editor was interested.\n\nYoung Fisher's home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and\nweather-beaten outside, but attractive within. The room that Jurgis saw\nwas half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly\nvisible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a\nlog fire was crackling in the open hearth. Seven or eight people were\ngathered about it when Adams and his friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to\nhis dismay that three of them were ladies. He had never talked to people\nof this sort before, and he fell into an agony of embarrassment. He\nstood in the doorway clutching his hat tightly in his hands, and made a\ndeep bow to each of the persons as he was introduced; then, when he was\nasked to have a seat, he took a chair in a dark corner, and sat down\nupon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his forehead with\nhis sleeve. He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk.\n\nThere was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening\ndress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named\nMaynard. There was the former's frail young wife, and also an elderly\nlady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college\nstudent, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face. She only\nspoke once or twice while Jurgis was there--the rest of the time she sat\nby the table in the center of the room, resting her chin in her hands\nand drinking in the conversation. There were two other men, whom young\nFisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Schliemann; he\nheard them address Adams as \"Comrade,\" and so he knew that they were\nSocialists.\n\nThe one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of\nclerical aspect; he had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired,\nand had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation.\nHe traveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon\nhospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall.\nThe other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor when\nAdams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they resumed\nit after the interruption. Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound, thinking\nthat here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in the world.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands\nand bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a\nprofessor of philosophy--until, as he said, he had found that he was\nselling his character as well as his time. Instead he had come to\nAmerica, where he lived in a garret room in this slum district, and made\nvolcanic energy take the place of fire. He studied the composition of\nfood-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates his\nbody needed; and by scientific chewing he said that he tripled the value\nof all he ate, so that it cost him eleven cents a day. About the first\nof July he would leave Chicago for his vacation, on foot; and when he\nstruck the harvest fields he would set to work for two dollars and a\nhalf a day, and come home when he had another year's supply--a hundred\nand twenty-five dollars. That was the nearest approach to independence\na man could make \"under capitalism,\" he explained; he would never marry,\nfor no sane man would allow himself to fall in love until after the\nrevolution.\n\nHe sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far in\nthe shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the fire\non the hearth. He spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with the\nmanner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom in\ngeometry, he would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of\nan ordinary person rise on end. And when the auditor had asserted\nhis non-comprehension, he would proceed to elucidate by some new\nproposition, yet more appalling. To Jurgis the Herr Dr. Schliemann\nassumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake. And yet,\nstrange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he\ncould follow the argument nearly all the time. He was carried over the\ndifficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad\ncareer--a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man\nas a small part of it. He understood human institutions, and blew them\nabout like soap bubbles. It was surprising that so much destructiveness\ncould be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose\nof government was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation\nof ancient force and modern fraud. Or was it marriage? Marriage\nand prostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man's\nexploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a\ndifference of class. If a woman had money she might dictate her own\nterms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy--that is, the\nproperty-rights--of her children. If she had no money, she was a\nproletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject\nbecame Religion, which was the Archfiend's deadliest weapon. Government\noppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind,\nand poisoned the stream of progress at its source. The working-man was\nto fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in\nthis one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience--in short\nto all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism. The destiny of civilization\nwould be decided in one final death struggle between the Red\nInternational and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic\nChurch; while here at home, \"the stygian midnight of American\nevangelicalism--\"\n\nAnd here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively\ntussle. \"Comrade\" Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he knew\nonly the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience. And\nwhat was the use, he asked, of confusing Religion with men's perversions\nof it? That the church was in the hands of the merchants at the moment\nwas obvious enough; but already there were signs of rebellion, and if\nComrade Schliemann could come back a few years from now--\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said the other, \"of course, I have no doubt that in a hundred\nyears the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed Socialism, just\nas at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.\"\n\n\"I am not defending the Vatican,\" exclaimed Lucas, vehemently. \"I am\ndefending the word of God--which is one long cry of the human spirit for\ndeliverance from the sway of oppression. Take the twenty-fourth chapter\nof the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as\n'the Bible upon the Beef Trust'; or take the words of Isaiah--or of the\nMaster himself! Not the elegant prince of our debauched and vicious art,\nnot the jeweled idol of our society churches--but the Jesus of the awful\nreality, the man of sorrow and pain, the outcast, despised of the world,\nwho had nowhere to lay his head--\"\n\n\"I will grant you Jesus,\" interrupted the other.\n\n\"Well, then,\" cried Lucas, \"and why should Jesus have nothing to do with\nhis church--why should his words and his life be of no authority among\nthose who profess to adore him? Here is a man who was the world's first\nrevolutionist, the true founder of the Socialist movement; a man whose\nwhole being was one flame of hatred for wealth, and all that wealth\nstands for,--for the pride of wealth, and the luxury of wealth, and the\ntyranny of wealth; who was himself a beggar and a tramp, a man of the\npeople, an associate of saloon-keepers and women of the town; who again\nand again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth and\nthe holding of wealth: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures on\nearth!'--'Sell that ye have and give alms!'--'Blessed are ye poor, for\nyours is the kingdom of Heaven!'--'Woe unto you that are rich, for ye\nhave received your consolation!'--'Verily, I say unto you, that a rich\nman shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven!' Who denounced in\nunmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time: 'Woe unto you, scribes\nand pharisees, hypocrites!'--'Woe unto you also, you lawyers!'--'Ye\nserpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of\nhell?' Who drove out the business men and brokers from the temple with a\nwhip! Who was crucified--think of it--for an incendiary and a disturber\nof the social order! And this man they have made into the high priest of\nproperty and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the horrors\nand abominations of modern commercial civilization! Jeweled images are\nmade of him, sensual priests burn incense to him, and modern pirates of\nindustry bring their dollars, wrung from the toil of helpless women\nand children, and build temples to him, and sit in cushioned seats and\nlisten to his teachings expounded by doctors of dusty divinity--\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Schliemann, laughing. But the other was in full\ncareer--he had talked this subject every day for five years, and had\nnever yet let himself be stopped. \"This Jesus of Nazareth!\" he cried.\n\"This class-conscious working-man! This union carpenter! This agitator,\nlaw-breaker, firebrand, anarchist! He, the sovereign lord and master\nof a world which grinds the bodies and souls of human beings into\ndollars--if he could come into the world this day and see the things\nthat men have made in his name, would it not blast his soul with horror?\nWould he not go mad at the sight of it, he the Prince of Mercy and Love!\nThat dreadful night when he lay in the Garden of Gethsemane and writhed\nin agony until he sweat blood--do you think that he saw anything worse\nthan he might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria, where men march\nout with a jeweled image of him before them, to do wholesale murder for\nthe benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and cruelty? Do you not know\nthat if he were in St. Petersburg now, he would take the whip with which\nhe drove out the bankers from his temple--\"\n\nHere the speaker paused an instant for breath. \"No, comrade,\" said the\nother, dryly, \"for he was a practical man. He would take pretty little\nimitation lemons, such as are now being shipped into Russia, handy for\ncarrying in the pockets, and strong enough to blow a whole temple out of\nsight.\"\n\nLucas waited until the company had stopped laughing over this; then\nhe began again: \"But look at it from the point of view of practical\npolitics, comrade. Here is an historical figure whom all men reverence\nand love, whom some regard as divine; and who was one of us--who lived\nour life, and taught our doctrine. And now shall we leave him in the\nhands of his enemies--shall we allow them to stifle and stultify his\nexample? We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not\nquote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he\ntaught, and what he did? No, no, a thousand times no!--we shall use his\nauthority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his ministry, and we\nshall yet rouse the people to action!--\"\n\nLucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on\nthe table. \"Here, comrade,\" he said, with a laugh, \"here is a place for\nyou to begin. A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty thousand\ndollars' worth of diamonds! And a most unctuous and oily of bishops!\nAn eminent and scholarly bishop! A philanthropist and friend of labor\nbishop--a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of the\nwage-working-man!\"\n\nTo this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as\nspectators. But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark,\nsomewhat naively, that he had always understood that Socialists had a\ncut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were\ntwo active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were\nagreed about nothing at all. Would the two, for his enlightenment, try\nto ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the\nsame party? This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of\ntwo carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in\nthe common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing\nthe necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist believes that\nthe means by which this is to be brought about is the class conscious\npolitical organization of the wage-earners. Thus far they were at\none; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the co-operative\ncommonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven, which is\n\"within you.\" To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary step toward\na far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience. Schliemann\ncalled himself a \"philosophic anarchist\"; and he explained that an\nanarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence was the\nfree development of every personality, unrestricted by laws save those\nof its own being. Since the same kind of match would light every one's\nfire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every one's stomach,\nit would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the control of a\nmajority vote. There was only one earth, and the quantity of material\nthings was limited. Of intellectual and moral things, on the other hand,\nthere was no limit, and one could have more without another's\nhaving less; hence \"Communism in material production, anarchism in\nintellectual,\" was the formula of modern proletarian thought. As soon\nas the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society had been healed,\nthere would be established a simple system whereby each man was credited\nwith his labor and debited with his purchases; and after that the\nprocesses of production, exchange, and consumption would go on\nautomatically, and without our being conscious of them, any more than\na man is conscious of the beating of his heart. And then, explained\nSchliemann, society would break up into independent, self-governing\ncommunities of mutually congenial persons; examples of which at present\nwere clubs, churches, and political parties. After the revolution, all\nthe intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be\ncared for by such \"free associations\"; romantic novelists would be\nsupported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist\npainters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist\npictures--and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors\nand musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could\nfind no one to maintain him, he could support himself by working part of\nthe time. That was the case at present, the only difference being that\nthe competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to\nlive, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any\none would be able to support himself by an hour's work a day. Also the\nartist's audience of the present was a small minority of people, all\ndebased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the\ncommercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which\nwould result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare\nof competition, we could at present form no conception whatever.\n\nAnd then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann\nasserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour's\ntoil by each of its members. \"Just what,\" answered the other, \"would be\nthe productive capacity of society if the present resources of science\nwere utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may be sure it\nwould exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds inured to\nthe ferocious barbarities of capitalism. After the triumph of the\ninternational proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and\nwho can figure the cost of war to humanity--not merely the value of the\nlives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping\nmillions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle\nand parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the\nwar attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the\ndrunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial\nimpotence and the moral deadness? Do you think that it would be too much\nto say that two hours of the working time of every efficient member of a\ncommunity goes to feed the red fiend of war?\"\n\nAnd then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of\ncompetition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and\nfriction; the vices--such as drink, for instance, the use of which had\nnearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification\nof the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the\ncommunity, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the\nwhole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the\nmilliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and\nlackeys. \"You understand,\" he said, \"that in a society dominated by\nthe fact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of\nprowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power. So we have,\nat the present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the\npopulation occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent\noccupied in destroying them. And this is not all; for the servants\nand panders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the\njewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful members\nof the community. And bear in mind also that this monstrous disease\naffects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison penetrates\nthe whole social body. Beneath the hundred thousand women of the elite\nare a million middle-class women, miserable because they are not of the\nelite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath them, in turn,\nare five million farmers' wives reading 'fashion papers' and trimming\nbonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling themselves into\nbrothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin robes. And then\nconsider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like\noil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling! You have\nmanufacturers contriving tens of thousands of catchpenny devices,\nstorekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and magazines filled up\nwith advertisements of them!\"\n\n\"And don't forget the wastes of fraud,\" put in young Fisher.\n\n\"When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,\"\nresponded Schliemann--\"the science of persuading people to buy what they\ndo not want--he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house\nof capitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen\nhorrors to point out first. But consider the waste in time and energy\nincidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes\nof ostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use!\nConsider all the waste incidental to the manufacture of cheap qualities\nof goods, of goods made to sell and deceive the ignorant; consider the\nwastes of adulteration,--the shoddy clothing, the cotton blankets, the\nunstable tenements, the ground-cork life-preservers, the adulterated\nmilk, the aniline soda water, the potato-flour sausages--\"\n\n\"And consider the moral aspects of the thing,\" put in the ex-preacher.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Schliemann; \"the low knavery and the ferocious cruelty\nincidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing, the\nblustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and\nworrying. Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of\ncompetition--they are but another form of the phrase 'to buy in the\ncheapest market and sell in the dearest.' A government official has\nstated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter dollars\na year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not only\nmaterials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human\nstomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have\nbeen well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years\nbefore the proper time. Then again, consider the waste of time and\nenergy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would\ndo. There are a million or two of business firms in the country,\nand five or ten times as many clerks; and consider the handling and\nrehandling, the accounting and reaccounting, the planning and worrying,\nthe balancing of petty profit and loss. Consider the whole machinery\nof the civil law made necessary by these processes; the libraries of\nponderous tomes, the courts and juries to interpret them, the lawyers\nstudying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the hatreds\nand lies! Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and haphazard\nproduction of commodities--the factories closed, the workers idle,\nthe goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the stock\nmanipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the overstimulation of\nothers, for speculative purposes; the assignments and bank failures,\nthe crises and panics, the deserted towns and the starving populations!\nConsider the energies wasted in the seeking of markets, the sterile\ntrades, such as drummer, solicitor, bill-poster, advertising agent.\nConsider the wastes incidental to the crowding into cities, made\nnecessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates; consider\nthe slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital energies;\nconsider the office buildings, the waste of time and material in the\npiling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground! Then take\nthe whole business of insurance, the enormous mass of administrative and\nclerical labor it involves, and all utter waste--\"\n\n\"I do not follow that,\" said the editor. \"The Cooperative Commonwealth\nis a universal automatic insurance company and savings bank for all its\nmembers. Capital being the property of all, injury to it is shared\nby all and made up by all. The bank is the universal government\ncredit-account, the ledger in which every individual's earnings and\nspendings are balanced. There is also a universal government bulletin,\nin which are listed and precisely described everything which the\ncommonwealth has for sale. As no one makes any profit by the sale, there\nis no longer any stimulus to extravagance, and no misrepresentation; no\ncheating, no adulteration or imitation, no bribery or 'grafting.'\"\n\n\"How is the price of an article determined?\"\n\n\"The price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is\ndetermined by the first principles of arithmetic. The million workers in\nthe nation's wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the total\nproduct of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a bushel of\nwheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day. If we employ an arbitrary\nsymbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then the cost of\na bushel of wheat is fifty cents.\"\n\n\"You say 'for farm work,'\" said Mr. Maynard. \"Then labor is not to be\npaid alike?\"\n\n\"Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should\nhave millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners. Of course the\nwages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will\nhave to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of\nworkers is needed in any particular industry. That is precisely what is\ndone at present, except that the transfer of the workers is accomplished\nblindly and imperfectly, by rumors and advertisements, instead of\ninstantly and completely, by a universal government bulletin.\"\n\n\"How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?\nWhat is the labor cost of a book?\"\n\n\"Obviously it is the labor cost of the paper, printing, and binding of\nit--about a fifth of its present cost.\"\n\n\"And the author?\"\n\n\"I have already said that the state could not control intellectual\nproduction. The state might say that it had taken a year to write the\nbook, and the author might say it had taken thirty. Goethe said that\nevery bon mot of his had cost a purse of gold. What I outline here is\na national, or rather international, system for the providing of the\nmaterial needs of men. Since a man has intellectual needs also, he will\nwork longer, earn more, and provide for them to his own taste and in his\nown way. I live on the same earth as the majority, I wear the same kind\nof shoes and sleep in the same kind of bed; but I do not think the same\nkind of thoughts, and I do not wish to pay for such thinkers as the\nmajority selects. I wish such things to be left to free effort, as\nat present. If people want to listen to a certain preacher, they get\ntogether and contribute what they please, and pay for a church and\nsupport the preacher, and then listen to him; I, who do not want to\nlisten to him, stay away, and it costs me nothing. In the same way there\nare magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and flying\nmachines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of them.\nOn the other hand, if wage slavery were abolished, and I could earn some\nspare money without paying tribute to an exploiting capitalist,\nthen there would be a magazine for the purpose of interpreting\nand popularizing the gospel of Friedrich Nietzsche, the prophet of\nEvolution, and also of Horace Fletcher, the inventor of the noble\nscience of clean eating; and incidentally, perhaps, for the discouraging\nof long skirts, and the scientific breeding of men and women, and the\nestablishing of divorce by mutual consent.\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused for a moment. \"That was a lecture,\" he said with a\nlaugh, \"and yet I am only begun!\"\n\n\"What else is there?\" asked Maynard.\n\n\"I have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,\"\nanswered the other. \"I have hardly mentioned the positive economies\nof co-operation. Allowing five to a family, there are fifteen million\nfamilies in this country; and at least ten million of these live\nseparately, the domestic drudge being either the wife or a wage slave.\nNow set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the\neconomies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the\nwashing of dishes. Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing\nfor a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a day's\nwork, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied persons--mostly\nwomen to do the dish-washing of the country. And note that this is most\nfilthy and deadening and brutalizing work; that it is a cause of anemia,\nnervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of prostitution, suicide, and\ninsanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate children--for all of which\nthings the community has naturally to pay. And now consider that in each\nof my little free communities there would be a machine which would wash\nand dry the dishes, and do it, not merely to the eye and the touch,\nbut scientifically--sterilizing them--and do it at a saving of all the\ndrudgery and nine-tenths of the time! All of these things you may\nfind in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take Kropotkin's Fields,\nFactories, and Workshops, and read about the new science of agriculture,\nwhich has been built up in the last ten years; by which, with made soils\nand intensive culture, a gardener can raise ten or twelve crops in a\nseason, and two hundred tons of vegetables upon a single acre; by which\nthe population of the whole globe could be supported on the soil now\ncultivated in the United States alone! It is impossible to apply such\nmethods now, owing to the ignorance and poverty of our scattered farming\npopulation; but imagine the problem of providing the food supply of our\nnation once taken in hand systematically and rationally, by scientists!\nAll the poor and rocky land set apart for a national timber reserve, in\nwhich our children play, and our young men hunt, and our poets dwell!\nThe most favorable climate and soil for each product selected; the\nexact requirements of the community known, and the acreage figured\naccordingly; the most improved machinery employed, under the direction\nof expert agricultural chemists! I was brought up on a farm, and I know\nthe awful deadliness of farm work; and I like to picture it all as\nit will be after the revolution. To picture the great potato-planting\nmachine, drawn by four horses, or an electric motor, ploughing the\nfurrow, cutting and dropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a\nscore of acres a day! To picture the great potato-digging machine,\nrun by electricity, perhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field,\nscooping up earth and potatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks! To\nevery other kind of vegetable and fruit handled in the same way--apples\nand oranges picked by machinery, cows milked by electricity--things\nwhich are already done, as you may know. To picture the harvest fields\nof the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a\nsummer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to\neach place! And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system\nof independent small farming,--a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated\nwith a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o'clock\nin the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they\nare able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut\nout from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and\ninvention, and all the joys of the spirit--held to a bare existence\nby competition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too\nblind to see his chains!\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused a moment. \"And then,\" he continued, \"place\nbeside this fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of\nphysiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to\noverfeeding! And then again, it has been proven that meat is unnecessary\nas a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce than\nvegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more likely\nto be unclean. But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more\nstrongly?\"\n\n\"How would Socialism change that?\" asked the girl-student, quickly. It\nwas the first time she had spoken.\n\n\"So long as we have wage slavery,\" answered Schliemann, \"it matters not\nin the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to\nfind people to perform it. But just as soon as labor is set free, then\nthe price of such work will begin to rise. So one by one the old, dingy,\nand unsanitary factories will come down--it will be cheaper to build\nnew; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking machinery, and\nso the dangerous trades will be made safe, or substitutes will be found\nfor their products. In exactly the same way, as the citizens of\nour Industrial Republic become refined, year by year the cost of\nslaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually those who want\nto eat meat will have to do their own killing--and how long do you think\nthe custom would survive then?--To go on to another item--one of the\nnecessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political\ncorruption; and one of the consequences of civic administration by\nignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable diseases kill off\nhalf our population. And even if science were allowed to try, it could\ndo little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings\nat all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others. They\nare penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and\nthe conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors\nin the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers\nof contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness\nimpossible for even the most selfish. For this reason I would seriously\nmaintain that all the medical and surgical discoveries that science can\nmake in the future will be of less importance than the application of\nthe knowledge we already possess, when the disinherited of the earth\nhave established their right to a human existence.\"\n\nAnd here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again. Jurgis had noticed\nthat the beautiful young girl who sat by the center-table was listening\nwith something of the same look that he himself had worn, the time when\nhe had first discovered Socialism. Jurgis would have liked to talk to\nher, he felt sure that she would have understood him. Later on in the\nevening, when the group broke up, he heard Mrs. Fisher say to her, in\na low voice, \"I wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same things\nabout Socialism\"; to which she answered, \"I don't know--but if he does\nwe shall know that he is a knave!\"\n\n\nAnd only a few hours after this came election day--when the long\ncampaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold\nits breath, awaiting the issue. Jurgis and the rest of the staff of\nHinds's Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they\nhurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening.\n\nBut already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph\ninstrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns. When the\nfinal accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four\nhundred thousand--an increase of something like three hundred and fifty\nper cent in four years. And that was doing well; but the party was\ndependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and\nnaturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones\nwhich felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall\nbelieved that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight\nhundred thousand. Just such an incredible increase had actually been\nmade in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700\nin 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and\nnow it was 69,000! So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in, the\nmeeting was a sight to be seen. Bulletins would be read, and the people\nwould shout themselves hoarse--and then some one would make a speech,\nand there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more\nbulletins. There would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring\nstates, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana had gone from\n2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of Ohio from 4,800\nto 36,000! There were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic\nindividuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented\nincreases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26 to 260; Henderson,\nKentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14 to 208; Cleo,\nOklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin's Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to 296--and many\nmore of the same kind. There were literally hundreds of such towns;\nthere would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of\ntelegrams. And the men who read the despatches off to the audience were\nold campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the\nvote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy, Illinois, from 189 to\n831--that was where the mayor had arrested a Socialist speaker! Crawford\nCounty, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was the home of the \"Appeal\nto Reason\"! Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the\nanswer of labor to the Citizens' Alliance Movement!\n\nAnd then there were official returns from the various precincts and\nwards of the city itself! Whether it was a factory district or one of\nthe \"silk-stocking\" wards seemed to make no particular difference in the\nincrease; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders\nmost was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards.\nPackingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the\nspring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600.\nNow, only one year later, it was over 6,300--and the Democratic vote\nonly 8,800! There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had\nbeen actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state\nlegislature had been elected. Thus Chicago now led the country; it had\nset a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!\n\n--So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes\nwere fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every\nsentence. The orator had been the head of the city's relief bureau in\nthe stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him\nsick. He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his\nlong arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of\nthe revolution. \"Organize! Organize! Organize!\"--that was his cry. He\nwas afraid of this tremendous vote, which his party had not expected,\nand which it had not earned. \"These men are not Socialists!\" he cried.\n\"This election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will\nforget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and\nrest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled to-day,\nand our enemies will laugh us to scorn! It rests with you to take your\nresolution--now, in the flush of victory, to find these men who have\nvoted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize them and bind\nthem to us! We shall not find all our campaigns as easy as this one.\nEverywhere in the country tonight the old party politicians are studying\nthis vote, and setting their sails by it; and nowhere will they be\nquicker or more cunning than here in our own city. Fifty thousand\nSocialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership Democracy in the\nspring! And then they will fool the voters once more, and all the powers\nof plunder and corruption will be swept into office again! But whatever\nthey may do when they get in, there is one thing they will not do, and\nthat will be the thing for which they were elected! They will not give\nthe people of our city municipal ownership--they will not mean to do it,\nthey will not try to do it; all that they will do is give our party\nin Chicago the greatest opportunity that has ever come to Socialism\nin America! We shall have the sham reformers self-stultified and\nself-convicted; we shall have the radical Democracy left without a lie\nwith which to cover its nakedness! And then will begin the rush that\nwill never be checked, the tide that will never turn till it has reached\nits flood--that will be irresistible, overwhelming--the rallying of the\noutraged workingmen of Chicago to our standard! And we shall organize\nthem, we shall drill them, we shall marshal them for the victory! We\nshall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us--and Chicago\nwill be ours! Chicago will be ours! CHICAGO WILL BE OURS!\"\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":6559.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 31","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210123044944\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/the-jungle\/summary\/chapter-31","summary_text":"After Jurgis gets his job, he goes to find Marija Berczynskas. He wants to tell her that she can quit being a prostitute. Jurgis will support the family. Marija says she can't. She's no good - she takes morphine, and she can't stop. Back at home, Teta Elzbieta is sick often, and the kids are wild and don't obey Jurgis. Still, Jurgis stands by them as best he can. The night before the election, Jurgis is invited to meet a bunch of Socialist Party leaders. Jurgis goes with the assistant clerk at Hinds's hotel, Harry Adams. There is an editor at the gathering. This man is Mr. Maynard, and he does not approve of socialism. Yet he also doesn't really understand what it is. The host of the party is Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who gave up all of his money to help improve the lives of the poor. Jurgis is embarrassed once he arrives, because he doesn't know how to talk to such educated people. Mr. Lucas is a preacher and evangelist, and Nicholas Schliemann is a former philosophy professor and nutritionist. Schliemann is originally from Switzerland. He has his own system for living under capitalism: he earns money working the fields over the summer and uses that money to buy a precise, scientific amount of food to keep him going the rest of the year. Jurgis walks in on an argument between Lucas and Schliemann on the value of religion to the socialist cause. Lucas believes wholeheartedly in using the Bible to preach about the redistribution of wealth. He points out that Jesus stood against the pride, greed, and luxury that wealth brings. Was it not Jesus who said, in the Sermon on the Mount: \"Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of Heaven\" ? Lucas keeps going on and on about Jesus as the first truly class-conscious man. Schliemann asks how they can feel free to use the Bible to preach this message when, right now, Christian bishops are accumulating huge wealth on the backs of the working man. Mr. Maynard, the east cost magazine editor, asks how it can be that two socialists disagree so actively about what direction to take the party? Lucas believes that socialism is a tool to creating a new promised land on Earth, New Jerusalem. Schliemann wants to see the centralization of all factories and private property, along with absolute freedom in thought and artistic production. Schliemann thinks this would lead to the natural development of communities based on like-minded people who choose to live and associate with one another. They would have so much more leisure time if they didn't have to compete with one another for work and there would be real time to devote to art and writing. Mr. Maynard wants to know how a society could possibly get by while demanding so little work from its members. Schliemann points out that capitalism wastes a lot of work on competition and strife between companies. If there was no concern about improving your standard of living, if everyone had enough to get by all right, the average worker would be much less stressed out and overwhelmed. After all, look how much each company spends on advertising! Without competition, there would be no need for marketing or for lying about the value of goods. Under this system, prices could be a lot lower because there would be no profit attached - a book would cost as much as necessary to cover production and no more. Schliemann doesn't mean that everyone will get exactly the same things - some people will work harder than others, and some will work less. Thus, some will get more than others. Still, everyone will be rewarded according to his efforts, and no one will be left behind. After the revolution, all of the social ills of ignorance, malnourishment of children, prostitution, and homelessness will be totally eliminated. Once labor is no longer figured into the cost of production, people won't have an incentive to do unpleasant work. In other words, let's say you were looking at two jobs, and one involved slaughtering cows and one involved growing vegetables. You would probably pick the second one unless there you got paid a lot more for the first one. But if all labor costs exactly the same thing - if you are paid according to how much you work, no matter what you are making - then there would be no reason ever to pursue a job you really, truly hated. This is why Schliemann feels that socialism will mean the end to unsafe labor practices: because factories will have to attract people to work for them. The power will all be on the side of the worker, not the factory owner. Schliemann predicts that this shift of power will also mean the end to the meatpacking industry as a whole. No one is going to choose to be surrounded by many, many slaughtered animals. In Schliemann's vision of a future world, we'll all be vegetarians. Jurgis overhears two women comment that Schliemann's speech must have converted Mr. Maynard to their cause. If not, then they'll know Mr. Maynard is a fool. The next day is Election Day. Jurgis hurries to a Socialist Party gathering to hear the results. The returns show that, across the board, there are more and more people turning out to vote for a socialist ticket. No city in the country is more actively socialist than Chicago. A speaker addresses the crowd: they must continue to organize! This is their opportunity! They must keep up their momentum! Chicago will be socialist!","summary_analysis":null,"summary_length":940.0,"analysis_length":1.0,"chap_int":31,"previous summary id":["chapter 30","chapter 30","chapter 30","chapter 30"],"previous chapter":["Jurgis, now awakened by Socialism, returns to Elzbieta's house where he attempts to convince her of the system's merits. She is skeptical, but decides that anything that keeps Jurgis away from drink and makes him industrious is worth it. Jurgis begins looking for a job and fortunately comes to find one in a hotel as a porter. When Ostrinski learns of Jurgis's job, he tells him that the hotel owner is one of the most passionate Socialist Party members in the city. The hotel, owned by a man name Hinds, is a hotbed of Socialist activity. Hinds tells Jurgis of his own life and struggles and anytime he is faced with adversity he mutters: \"'Capitalism, my boy, Capitalism. Ecrasez l'Infame. The hotel employs a number of Socialist Party members and every night the employees get into intense arguments and debates with guests who defend systems of capitalism and individualism. Hinds explains how the Oil Trust, the Beef Trust, and the Railroad Trust actually own the country and the politicians. Some guests change their minds and attitudes towards socialism, and some do not. Jurgis begins to spend all his time and much of his money on spreading the Socialist cause, though he does occasionally fall into old habits of drink. At those times, he remembers, however, that it is a \"wicked thing to spend one's pennies for a drink, when the working-class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered. Jurgis attempts to convert his neighbors to socialism, though he makes many enemies and almost gets into a few fights during the process. The people tell Jurgis that socialism is \"paternalism,\" but Jurgis argues that by letting the capitalists rule the country and build the libraries and social structures, they are not allowing the workers to build their own country. Capitalism is true paternalism. Jurgis meets and hears a number of famous socialist speakers and writers. He meets the \"Little Giant,\" a little person who \"had written a veritable encyclopedia\" of Socialism. He hears a young author from California that had made a fortune selling books but that had never ceased to fight for the poor. He begins to read the \"Appeal to Reason,\" a tabloid newspaper that spreads the word of socialism through fantastical stories. Jurgis and the Socialist Party members distribute flyers and pamphlets telling the people of Packingtown what they can do to fight the Beef Trust when their strike fails. Feeling pressure, Mike Scully brings in the South Carolina \"pitchfork Senator\" to speak to the workers and to fight for the Republican Party. Jurgis stands up, however, and gives his own speech in the meeting, telling the crowd how he himself had been a part of the political machine that had bought votes and oppressed the voice of the people","The next morning, Jurgis goes to find Teta Elzbieta. He starts talking to her about socialism. Teta Elzbieta couldn't care less about whether or not socialism is right for the world. All she cares about is that Jurgis's new convictions mean that he plans to stay sober and look for a job. Once she figures that out, she encourages Jurgis's socialism as much as he wants. Jurgis starts looking for jobs at the various hotels in the neighborhood. A week later, Jurgis goes into the lobby of a hotel and approaches the owner. The owner asks Jurgis if he drinks. Jurgis says no, and the owner asks Jurgis if he is afraid of hard work. There's a job available for a night porter, but he'll have to do a lot of cleaning and hauling. Jurgis says that's fine. Jurgis tells Ostrinski he's gotten a job at a nearby hotel. Ostrinski is thrilled to hear that Jurgis has been hired at Hind's Hotel. Apparently, Tommy Hinds, the owner of this place, is a state organizer of the Socialist Party in Illinois. The next day, Jurgis informs his employer that he is also a socialist. Tommy Hinds shakes his hand. Tommy Hinds calls Jurgis \"Comrade Jurgis,\" and Jurgis calls his boss \"Comrade Hinds.\" Tommy Hinds frequently goes out to convince people to vote the socialist ticket to solve their troubles. He has a history as a union organizer and populist. After the 1896 election, in which Populist and Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan lost his campaign for president, Tommy Hinds gave up on the idea of wealth in private hands. Ever since then, he has been getting himself invited to every business meeting and church service in Chicago so that he can preach the value of socialism far and wide. Tommy Hinds's hotel is also a big source of pro-socialist political activity. His staff members are all socialists, and his chief clerk has been fighting the big railroad companies his whole life. His assistant clerk is Harry Adams, a smart guy from Massachusetts who moved down south to South Carolina and was horrified by the widespread illiteracy and poverty he found there. So he moved to Chicago and became a socialist. Oddly, the fact that this hotel is a socialist business doesn't mean it's not profitable. The hotel is inexpensive and gets plenty of out-of-towners looking for work in the stockyards who are too poor to afford lodging elsewhere. Tommy Hinds works to convert all of these new guys to the cause. He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards. Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him to get personal - he just wants Jurgis to explain the bad business and hygiene practices at these meatpacking plants. Tommy Hinds explains that it's not just the Beef Trust ; all business in the US is dominated by just a few super-powerful companies. The Standard Oil Company controls the price of oil and the Steel Trust overcharges on nails, and so on. Jurgis learns everything he needs to know about socialism working for Tommy Hinds. Because he has such faith in Tommy Hinds's views, Jurgis works harder and with more loyalty than he ever would have for the meatpackers. Jurgis does his best to convert his acquaintances to socialism. Still, he often finds himself almost getting into fights. Even though the benefits of socialism seem obvious to Jurgis, a lot of working people resist. They claim to prefer individualism, and resist the kind of control on their money that socialism would mean. Jurgis feels that these people are forgetting that the people who really benefit from individualism and capitalism are the steel, oil, and meat magnates. It's never the working guy who profits from free enterprise. Jurgis starts to read newspapers and to learn about America's history so that he can convince people to join the socialist cause. At socialist meetings, Jurgis meets a range of extraordinary organizers and great people who have sacrificed so much to join the cause of the working man. Jurgis becomes a regular reader of Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper with lots of tidbits about how the American working man suffers. They begin to distribute this newspaper in Packingtown after the union lost the strike there, so that workers can take hope. Jurgis also hands out Appeal to Reason in the stockyards in an effort to undo the damage he did when he was part of Mike Scully's political machine. The socialists are gaining a real political foothold in Packingtown, and Mike Scully and his political machine are on the run.","With his newfound faith and fire, Jurgis goes to see Elzbieta. She is not interested in his politics but notices the spark of industry in his eyes and tolerates his rhetoric. Soon Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a hotel, a hotel that, coincidentally, is a political hotbed of socialism. The proprietor of the hotel, Tommy Hinds, and his staff educate Jurgis and others in the ways and means of socialism. Gradually, socialism becomes the root of Jurgis' existence.","Jurgis visits Teta Elzbieta to tell her about socialism. She is happy to hear that he wishes to work and help support the family. She even agrees to attend socialist political meetings with him from time to time. Jurgis finds a job as a porter in a small hotel that pays thirty dollars a month plus board. Ostrinski informs Jurgis that his new boss, Tommy Hinds, is actually a state organizer for the socialist party and a well-known socialist speaker. Hinds is overjoyed to find that Jurgis is a comrade. Hinds never tires of preaching socialism in his hotel and elsewhere. Socialists flock to the hotel, so the radical philosophy of the proprietor does not hurt the business he owns. Hinds often urges Jurgis to detail the horrendous filth of the meat-packing plants along with the real recipes for tinned meats and sausages. Jurgis takes up the socialist cause with a passion. He endeavors to read newspapers, including The Appeal to Reason, and learn all about the political and economic systems of power in America. He becomes angry and frustrated when he cannot sway people to socialism"],"next summary id":"chapter 31","next chapter":"After Jurgis gets his job, he goes to find Marija Berczynskas. He wants to tell her that she can quit being a prostitute. Jurgis will support the family. Marija says she can't. She's no good - she takes morphine, and she can't stop. Back at home, Teta Elzbieta is sick often, and the kids are wild and don't obey Jurgis. Still, Jurgis stands by them as best he can. The night before the election, Jurgis is invited to meet a bunch of Socialist Party leaders. Jurgis goes with the assistant clerk at Hinds's hotel, Harry Adams. There is an editor at the gathering. This man is Mr. Maynard, and he does not approve of socialism. Yet he also doesn't really understand what it is. The host of the party is Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who gave up all of his money to help improve the lives of the poor. Jurgis is embarrassed once he arrives, because he doesn't know how to talk to such educated people. Mr. Lucas is a preacher and evangelist, and Nicholas Schliemann is a former philosophy professor and nutritionist. Schliemann is originally from Switzerland. He has his own system for living under capitalism: he earns money working the fields over the summer and uses that money to buy a precise, scientific amount of food to keep him going the rest of the year. Jurgis walks in on an argument between Lucas and Schliemann on the value of religion to the socialist cause. Lucas believes wholeheartedly in using the Bible to preach about the redistribution of wealth. He points out that Jesus stood against the pride, greed, and luxury that wealth brings. Was it not Jesus who said, in the Sermon on the Mount: \"Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of Heaven\" ? Lucas keeps going on and on about Jesus as the first truly class-conscious man. Schliemann asks how they can feel free to use the Bible to preach this message when, right now, Christian bishops are accumulating huge wealth on the backs of the working man. Mr. Maynard, the east cost magazine editor, asks how it can be that two socialists disagree so actively about what direction to take the party? Lucas believes that socialism is a tool to creating a new promised land on Earth, New Jerusalem. Schliemann wants to see the centralization of all factories and private property, along with absolute freedom in thought and artistic production. Schliemann thinks this would lead to the natural development of communities based on like-minded people who choose to live and associate with one another. They would have so much more leisure time if they didn't have to compete with one another for work and there would be real time to devote to art and writing. Mr. Maynard wants to know how a society could possibly get by while demanding so little work from its members. Schliemann points out that capitalism wastes a lot of work on competition and strife between companies. If there was no concern about improving your standard of living, if everyone had enough to get by all right, the average worker would be much less stressed out and overwhelmed. After all, look how much each company spends on advertising! Without competition, there would be no need for marketing or for lying about the value of goods. Under this system, prices could be a lot lower because there would be no profit attached - a book would cost as much as necessary to cover production and no more. Schliemann doesn't mean that everyone will get exactly the same things - some people will work harder than others, and some will work less. Thus, some will get more than others. Still, everyone will be rewarded according to his efforts, and no one will be left behind. After the revolution, all of the social ills of ignorance, malnourishment of children, prostitution, and homelessness will be totally eliminated. Once labor is no longer figured into the cost of production, people won't have an incentive to do unpleasant work. In other words, let's say you were looking at two jobs, and one involved slaughtering cows and one involved growing vegetables. You would probably pick the second one unless there you got paid a lot more for the first one. But if all labor costs exactly the same thing - if you are paid according to how much you work, no matter what you are making - then there would be no reason ever to pursue a job you really, truly hated. This is why Schliemann feels that socialism will mean the end to unsafe labor practices: because factories will have to attract people to work for them. The power will all be on the side of the worker, not the factory owner. Schliemann predicts that this shift of power will also mean the end to the meatpacking industry as a whole. No one is going to choose to be surrounded by many, many slaughtered animals. In Schliemann's vision of a future world, we'll all be vegetarians. Jurgis overhears two women comment that Schliemann's speech must have converted Mr. Maynard to their cause. If not, then they'll know Mr. Maynard is a fool. The next day is Election Day. Jurgis hurries to a Socialist Party gathering to hear the results. The returns show that, across the board, there are more and more people turning out to vote for a socialist ticket. No city in the country is more actively socialist than Chicago. A speaker addresses the crowd: they must continue to organize! This is their opportunity! They must keep up their momentum! Chicago will be socialist!"}

Members of the Socialist Party in Chicago are preparing for the election. On the night before the vote, a millionaire sympathetic to the socialist movement invites Jurgis to dinner. Here Jurgis encounters Lucas, an evangelist, and Nicholas Schliemann, a former philosophy professor, who debate the nature of socialism while answering questions for a skeptical magazine editor. Jurgis attends a party gathering the next day to watch election returns. The Socialist Party makes substantial gains across the country, especially in Packingtown. One socialist leader interprets the results as a call for further organization by party members, for the voters may not really be socialists, but rather just disgruntled democrats.

This harsh reality is evident, and for her to do so would undermine everything else in the text. Although socialism is the only hope for the working person, Marija does not see this. She has reluctantly accepted the way of a capitalistic society and has become both unwilling and unable to change. New characters discuss the two major aspects of socialism -- its religious and scientific implications. Some embrace socialism as a new religion, replacing Christianity, while others favor the efficiency, rationality, and order of the new system, believing it superior to all other forms of government. The dialogue between Schliemann and Lucas does nothing to further the plot and does not include Jurgis at all; rather, they voice Sinclair's opinions, becoming a sounding board for the pro-socialist movement. The statistics at the end of the novel mirror actual results of the presidential election of 1904. Although the socialists view the number of votes they received as a significant increase from the past election, the actual number of votes was statistically quite low. In the original serial form of The Jungle, Jurgis is arrested on election night; however, this ending does not emphasize a socialist triumph, and Sinclair changed the ending when The Jungle was published in book form.

She came down into the basement of the house to meet\nhim, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, \"I've\ngot work now, and so you can leave here.\"\n\nBut Marija only shook her head. There was nothing else for her to\ndo, she said, and nobody to employ her. She could not keep her past a\nsecret--girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were\nthousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would\nmeet one of them. \"And besides,\" Marija added, \"I can't do anything. I'm\nno good--I take dope. What could you do with me?\"\n\n\"Can't you stop?\" Jurgis cried.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I'll never stop. What's the use of talking about\nit--I'll stay here till I die, I guess. It's all I'm fit for.\" And that\nwas all that he could get her to say--there was no use trying. When\nhe told her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered\nindifferently: \"Then it'll be wasted here--that's all.\" Her eyelids\nlooked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was\nannoying her, that she only wanted him to go away. So he went,\ndisappointed and sad.\n\nPoor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life. Elzbieta was sick a\ngood deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the\nworse for their life upon the streets. But he stuck by the family\nnevertheless, for they reminded him of his old happiness; and when\nthings went wrong he could solace himself with a plunge into the\nSocialist movement. Since his life had been caught up into the current\nof this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life\nto him came to seem of relatively slight importance; his interests were\nelsewhere, in the world of ideas. His outward life was commonplace and\nuninteresting; he was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one\nwhile he lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his life was a\nperpetual adventure. There was so much to know--so many wonders to\nbe discovered! Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before\nelection, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry\nAdams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis\nwent, and met one of the minds of the movement.\n\nThe invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who\nhad given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the\nheart of the city's slums. He did not belong to the party, but he was\nin sympathy with it; and he said that he was to have as his guest that\nnight the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against Socialism,\nbut really did not know what it was. The millionaire suggested that\nAdams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject of \"pure food,\"\nin which the editor was interested.\n\nYoung Fisher's home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and\nweather-beaten outside, but attractive within. The room that Jurgis saw\nwas half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly\nvisible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a\nlog fire was crackling in the open hearth. Seven or eight people were\ngathered about it when Adams and his friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to\nhis dismay that three of them were ladies. He had never talked to people\nof this sort before, and he fell into an agony of embarrassment. He\nstood in the doorway clutching his hat tightly in his hands, and made a\ndeep bow to each of the persons as he was introduced; then, when he was\nasked to have a seat, he took a chair in a dark corner, and sat down\nupon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his forehead with\nhis sleeve. He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk.\n\nThere was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening\ndress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named\nMaynard. There was the former's frail young wife, and also an elderly\nlady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college\nstudent, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face. She only\nspoke once or twice while Jurgis was there--the rest of the time she sat\nby the table in the center of the room, resting her chin in her hands\nand drinking in the conversation. There were two other men, whom young\nFisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Schliemann; he\nheard them address Adams as \"Comrade,\" and so he knew that they were\nSocialists.\n\nThe one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of\nclerical aspect; he had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired,\nand had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation.\nHe traveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon\nhospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall.\nThe other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor when\nAdams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they resumed\nit after the interruption. Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound, thinking\nthat here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in the world.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands\nand bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a\nprofessor of philosophy--until, as he said, he had found that he was\nselling his character as well as his time. Instead he had come to\nAmerica, where he lived in a garret room in this slum district, and made\nvolcanic energy take the place of fire. He studied the composition of\nfood-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates his\nbody needed; and by scientific chewing he said that he tripled the value\nof all he ate, so that it cost him eleven cents a day. About the first\nof July he would leave Chicago for his vacation, on foot; and when he\nstruck the harvest fields he would set to work for two dollars and a\nhalf a day, and come home when he had another year's supply--a hundred\nand twenty-five dollars. That was the nearest approach to independence\na man could make \"under capitalism,\" he explained; he would never marry,\nfor no sane man would allow himself to fall in love until after the\nrevolution.\n\nHe sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far in\nthe shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the fire\non the hearth. He spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with the\nmanner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom in\ngeometry, he would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of\nan ordinary person rise on end. And when the auditor had asserted\nhis non-comprehension, he would proceed to elucidate by some new\nproposition, yet more appalling. To Jurgis the Herr Dr. Schliemann\nassumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake. And yet,\nstrange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he\ncould follow the argument nearly all the time. He was carried over the\ndifficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad\ncareer--a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man\nas a small part of it. He understood human institutions, and blew them\nabout like soap bubbles. It was surprising that so much destructiveness\ncould be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose\nof government was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation\nof ancient force and modern fraud. Or was it marriage? Marriage\nand prostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man's\nexploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a\ndifference of class. If a woman had money she might dictate her own\nterms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy--that is, the\nproperty-rights--of her children. If she had no money, she was a\nproletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject\nbecame Religion, which was the Archfiend's deadliest weapon. Government\noppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind,\nand poisoned the stream of progress at its source. The working-man was\nto fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in\nthis one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience--in short\nto all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism. The destiny of civilization\nwould be decided in one final death struggle between the Red\nInternational and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic\nChurch; while here at home, \"the stygian midnight of American\nevangelicalism--\"\n\nAnd here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively\ntussle. \"Comrade\" Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he knew\nonly the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience. And\nwhat was the use, he asked, of confusing Religion with men's perversions\nof it? That the church was in the hands of the merchants at the moment\nwas obvious enough; but already there were signs of rebellion, and if\nComrade Schliemann could come back a few years from now--\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said the other, \"of course, I have no doubt that in a hundred\nyears the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed Socialism, just\nas at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.\"\n\n\"I am not defending the Vatican,\" exclaimed Lucas, vehemently. \"I am\ndefending the word of God--which is one long cry of the human spirit for\ndeliverance from the sway of oppression. Take the twenty-fourth chapter\nof the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as\n'the Bible upon the Beef Trust'; or take the words of Isaiah--or of the\nMaster himself! Not the elegant prince of our debauched and vicious art,\nnot the jeweled idol of our society churches--but the Jesus of the awful\nreality, the man of sorrow and pain, the outcast, despised of the world,\nwho had nowhere to lay his head--\"\n\n\"I will grant you Jesus,\" interrupted the other.\n\n\"Well, then,\" cried Lucas, \"and why should Jesus have nothing to do with\nhis church--why should his words and his life be of no authority among\nthose who profess to adore him? Here is a man who was the world's first\nrevolutionist, the true founder of the Socialist movement; a man whose\nwhole being was one flame of hatred for wealth, and all that wealth\nstands for,--for the pride of wealth, and the luxury of wealth, and the\ntyranny of wealth; who was himself a beggar and a tramp, a man of the\npeople, an associate of saloon-keepers and women of the town; who again\nand again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth and\nthe holding of wealth: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures on\nearth!'--'Sell that ye have and give alms!'--'Blessed are ye poor, for\nyours is the kingdom of Heaven!'--'Woe unto you that are rich, for ye\nhave received your consolation!'--'Verily, I say unto you, that a rich\nman shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven!' Who denounced in\nunmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time: 'Woe unto you, scribes\nand pharisees, hypocrites!'--'Woe unto you also, you lawyers!'--'Ye\nserpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of\nhell?' Who drove out the business men and brokers from the temple with a\nwhip! Who was crucified--think of it--for an incendiary and a disturber\nof the social order! And this man they have made into the high priest of\nproperty and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the horrors\nand abominations of modern commercial civilization! Jeweled images are\nmade of him, sensual priests burn incense to him, and modern pirates of\nindustry bring their dollars, wrung from the toil of helpless women\nand children, and build temples to him, and sit in cushioned seats and\nlisten to his teachings expounded by doctors of dusty divinity--\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Schliemann, laughing. But the other was in full\ncareer--he had talked this subject every day for five years, and had\nnever yet let himself be stopped. \"This Jesus of Nazareth!\" he cried.\n\"This class-conscious working-man! This union carpenter! This agitator,\nlaw-breaker, firebrand, anarchist! He, the sovereign lord and master\nof a world which grinds the bodies and souls of human beings into\ndollars--if he could come into the world this day and see the things\nthat men have made in his name, would it not blast his soul with horror?\nWould he not go mad at the sight of it, he the Prince of Mercy and Love!\nThat dreadful night when he lay in the Garden of Gethsemane and writhed\nin agony until he sweat blood--do you think that he saw anything worse\nthan he might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria, where men march\nout with a jeweled image of him before them, to do wholesale murder for\nthe benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and cruelty? Do you not know\nthat if he were in St. Petersburg now, he would take the whip with which\nhe drove out the bankers from his temple--\"\n\nHere the speaker paused an instant for breath. \"No, comrade,\" said the\nother, dryly, \"for he was a practical man. He would take pretty little\nimitation lemons, such as are now being shipped into Russia, handy for\ncarrying in the pockets, and strong enough to blow a whole temple out of\nsight.\"\n\nLucas waited until the company had stopped laughing over this; then\nhe began again: \"But look at it from the point of view of practical\npolitics, comrade. Here is an historical figure whom all men reverence\nand love, whom some regard as divine; and who was one of us--who lived\nour life, and taught our doctrine. And now shall we leave him in the\nhands of his enemies--shall we allow them to stifle and stultify his\nexample? We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not\nquote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he\ntaught, and what he did? No, no, a thousand times no!--we shall use his\nauthority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his ministry, and we\nshall yet rouse the people to action!--\"\n\nLucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on\nthe table. \"Here, comrade,\" he said, with a laugh, \"here is a place for\nyou to begin. A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty thousand\ndollars' worth of diamonds! And a most unctuous and oily of bishops!\nAn eminent and scholarly bishop! A philanthropist and friend of labor\nbishop--a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of the\nwage-working-man!\"\n\nTo this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as\nspectators. But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark,\nsomewhat naively, that he had always understood that Socialists had a\ncut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were\ntwo active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were\nagreed about nothing at all. Would the two, for his enlightenment, try\nto ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the\nsame party? This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of\ntwo carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in\nthe common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing\nthe necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist believes that\nthe means by which this is to be brought about is the class conscious\npolitical organization of the wage-earners. Thus far they were at\none; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the co-operative\ncommonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven, which is\n\"within you.\" To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary step toward\na far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience. Schliemann\ncalled himself a \"philosophic anarchist\"; and he explained that an\nanarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence was the\nfree development of every personality, unrestricted by laws save those\nof its own being. Since the same kind of match would light every one's\nfire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every one's stomach,\nit would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the control of a\nmajority vote. There was only one earth, and the quantity of material\nthings was limited. Of intellectual and moral things, on the other hand,\nthere was no limit, and one could have more without another's\nhaving less; hence \"Communism in material production, anarchism in\nintellectual,\" was the formula of modern proletarian thought. As soon\nas the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society had been healed,\nthere would be established a simple system whereby each man was credited\nwith his labor and debited with his purchases; and after that the\nprocesses of production, exchange, and consumption would go on\nautomatically, and without our being conscious of them, any more than\na man is conscious of the beating of his heart. And then, explained\nSchliemann, society would break up into independent, self-governing\ncommunities of mutually congenial persons; examples of which at present\nwere clubs, churches, and political parties. After the revolution, all\nthe intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be\ncared for by such \"free associations\"; romantic novelists would be\nsupported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist\npainters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist\npictures--and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors\nand musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could\nfind no one to maintain him, he could support himself by working part of\nthe time. That was the case at present, the only difference being that\nthe competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to\nlive, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any\none would be able to support himself by an hour's work a day. Also the\nartist's audience of the present was a small minority of people, all\ndebased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the\ncommercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which\nwould result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare\nof competition, we could at present form no conception whatever.\n\nAnd then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann\nasserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour's\ntoil by each of its members. \"Just what,\" answered the other, \"would be\nthe productive capacity of society if the present resources of science\nwere utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may be sure it\nwould exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds inured to\nthe ferocious barbarities of capitalism. After the triumph of the\ninternational proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and\nwho can figure the cost of war to humanity--not merely the value of the\nlives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping\nmillions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle\nand parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the\nwar attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the\ndrunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial\nimpotence and the moral deadness? Do you think that it would be too much\nto say that two hours of the working time of every efficient member of a\ncommunity goes to feed the red fiend of war?\"\n\nAnd then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of\ncompetition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and\nfriction; the vices--such as drink, for instance, the use of which had\nnearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification\nof the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the\ncommunity, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the\nwhole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the\nmilliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and\nlackeys. \"You understand,\" he said, \"that in a society dominated by\nthe fact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of\nprowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power. So we have,\nat the present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the\npopulation occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent\noccupied in destroying them. And this is not all; for the servants\nand panders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the\njewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful members\nof the community. And bear in mind also that this monstrous disease\naffects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison penetrates\nthe whole social body. Beneath the hundred thousand women of the elite\nare a million middle-class women, miserable because they are not of the\nelite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath them, in turn,\nare five million farmers' wives reading 'fashion papers' and trimming\nbonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling themselves into\nbrothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin robes. And then\nconsider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like\noil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling! You have\nmanufacturers contriving tens of thousands of catchpenny devices,\nstorekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and magazines filled up\nwith advertisements of them!\"\n\n\"And don't forget the wastes of fraud,\" put in young Fisher.\n\n\"When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,\"\nresponded Schliemann--\"the science of persuading people to buy what they\ndo not want--he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house\nof capitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen\nhorrors to point out first. But consider the waste in time and energy\nincidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes\nof ostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use!\nConsider all the waste incidental to the manufacture of cheap qualities\nof goods, of goods made to sell and deceive the ignorant; consider the\nwastes of adulteration,--the shoddy clothing, the cotton blankets, the\nunstable tenements, the ground-cork life-preservers, the adulterated\nmilk, the aniline soda water, the potato-flour sausages--\"\n\n\"And consider the moral aspects of the thing,\" put in the ex-preacher.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Schliemann; \"the low knavery and the ferocious cruelty\nincidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing, the\nblustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and\nworrying. Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of\ncompetition--they are but another form of the phrase 'to buy in the\ncheapest market and sell in the dearest.' A government official has\nstated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter dollars\na year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not only\nmaterials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human\nstomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have\nbeen well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years\nbefore the proper time. Then again, consider the waste of time and\nenergy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would\ndo. There are a million or two of business firms in the country,\nand five or ten times as many clerks; and consider the handling and\nrehandling, the accounting and reaccounting, the planning and worrying,\nthe balancing of petty profit and loss. Consider the whole machinery\nof the civil law made necessary by these processes; the libraries of\nponderous tomes, the courts and juries to interpret them, the lawyers\nstudying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the hatreds\nand lies! Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and haphazard\nproduction of commodities--the factories closed, the workers idle,\nthe goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the stock\nmanipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the overstimulation of\nothers, for speculative purposes; the assignments and bank failures,\nthe crises and panics, the deserted towns and the starving populations!\nConsider the energies wasted in the seeking of markets, the sterile\ntrades, such as drummer, solicitor, bill-poster, advertising agent.\nConsider the wastes incidental to the crowding into cities, made\nnecessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates; consider\nthe slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital energies;\nconsider the office buildings, the waste of time and material in the\npiling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground! Then take\nthe whole business of insurance, the enormous mass of administrative and\nclerical labor it involves, and all utter waste--\"\n\n\"I do not follow that,\" said the editor. \"The Cooperative Commonwealth\nis a universal automatic insurance company and savings bank for all its\nmembers. Capital being the property of all, injury to it is shared\nby all and made up by all. The bank is the universal government\ncredit-account, the ledger in which every individual's earnings and\nspendings are balanced. There is also a universal government bulletin,\nin which are listed and precisely described everything which the\ncommonwealth has for sale. As no one makes any profit by the sale, there\nis no longer any stimulus to extravagance, and no misrepresentation; no\ncheating, no adulteration or imitation, no bribery or 'grafting.'\"\n\n\"How is the price of an article determined?\"\n\n\"The price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is\ndetermined by the first principles of arithmetic. The million workers in\nthe nation's wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the total\nproduct of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a bushel of\nwheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day. If we employ an arbitrary\nsymbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then the cost of\na bushel of wheat is fifty cents.\"\n\n\"You say 'for farm work,'\" said Mr. Maynard. \"Then labor is not to be\npaid alike?\"\n\n\"Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should\nhave millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners. Of course the\nwages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will\nhave to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of\nworkers is needed in any particular industry. That is precisely what is\ndone at present, except that the transfer of the workers is accomplished\nblindly and imperfectly, by rumors and advertisements, instead of\ninstantly and completely, by a universal government bulletin.\"\n\n\"How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?\nWhat is the labor cost of a book?\"\n\n\"Obviously it is the labor cost of the paper, printing, and binding of\nit--about a fifth of its present cost.\"\n\n\"And the author?\"\n\n\"I have already said that the state could not control intellectual\nproduction. The state might say that it had taken a year to write the\nbook, and the author might say it had taken thirty. Goethe said that\nevery bon mot of his had cost a purse of gold. What I outline here is\na national, or rather international, system for the providing of the\nmaterial needs of men. Since a man has intellectual needs also, he will\nwork longer, earn more, and provide for them to his own taste and in his\nown way. I live on the same earth as the majority, I wear the same kind\nof shoes and sleep in the same kind of bed; but I do not think the same\nkind of thoughts, and I do not wish to pay for such thinkers as the\nmajority selects. I wish such things to be left to free effort, as\nat present. If people want to listen to a certain preacher, they get\ntogether and contribute what they please, and pay for a church and\nsupport the preacher, and then listen to him; I, who do not want to\nlisten to him, stay away, and it costs me nothing. In the same way there\nare magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and flying\nmachines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of them.\nOn the other hand, if wage slavery were abolished, and I could earn some\nspare money without paying tribute to an exploiting capitalist,\nthen there would be a magazine for the purpose of interpreting\nand popularizing the gospel of Friedrich Nietzsche, the prophet of\nEvolution, and also of Horace Fletcher, the inventor of the noble\nscience of clean eating; and incidentally, perhaps, for the discouraging\nof long skirts, and the scientific breeding of men and women, and the\nestablishing of divorce by mutual consent.\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused for a moment. \"That was a lecture,\" he said with a\nlaugh, \"and yet I am only begun!\"\n\n\"What else is there?\" asked Maynard.\n\n\"I have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,\"\nanswered the other. \"I have hardly mentioned the positive economies\nof co-operation. Allowing five to a family, there are fifteen million\nfamilies in this country; and at least ten million of these live\nseparately, the domestic drudge being either the wife or a wage slave.\nNow set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the\neconomies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the\nwashing of dishes. Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing\nfor a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a day's\nwork, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied persons--mostly\nwomen to do the dish-washing of the country. And note that this is most\nfilthy and deadening and brutalizing work; that it is a cause of anemia,\nnervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of prostitution, suicide, and\ninsanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate children--for all of which\nthings the community has naturally to pay. And now consider that in each\nof my little free communities there would be a machine which would wash\nand dry the dishes, and do it, not merely to the eye and the touch,\nbut scientifically--sterilizing them--and do it at a saving of all the\ndrudgery and nine-tenths of the time! All of these things you may\nfind in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take Kropotkin's Fields,\nFactories, and Workshops, and read about the new science of agriculture,\nwhich has been built up in the last ten years; by which, with made soils\nand intensive culture, a gardener can raise ten or twelve crops in a\nseason, and two hundred tons of vegetables upon a single acre; by which\nthe population of the whole globe could be supported on the soil now\ncultivated in the United States alone! It is impossible to apply such\nmethods now, owing to the ignorance and poverty of our scattered farming\npopulation; but imagine the problem of providing the food supply of our\nnation once taken in hand systematically and rationally, by scientists!\nAll the poor and rocky land set apart for a national timber reserve, in\nwhich our children play, and our young men hunt, and our poets dwell!\nThe most favorable climate and soil for each product selected; the\nexact requirements of the community known, and the acreage figured\naccordingly; the most improved machinery employed, under the direction\nof expert agricultural chemists! I was brought up on a farm, and I know\nthe awful deadliness of farm work; and I like to picture it all as\nit will be after the revolution. To picture the great potato-planting\nmachine, drawn by four horses, or an electric motor, ploughing the\nfurrow, cutting and dropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a\nscore of acres a day! To picture the great potato-digging machine,\nrun by electricity, perhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field,\nscooping up earth and potatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks! To\nevery other kind of vegetable and fruit handled in the same way--apples\nand oranges picked by machinery, cows milked by electricity--things\nwhich are already done, as you may know. To picture the harvest fields\nof the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a\nsummer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to\neach place! And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system\nof independent small farming,--a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated\nwith a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o'clock\nin the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they\nare able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut\nout from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and\ninvention, and all the joys of the spirit--held to a bare existence\nby competition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too\nblind to see his chains!\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused a moment. \"And then,\" he continued, \"place\nbeside this fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of\nphysiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to\noverfeeding! And then again, it has been proven that meat is unnecessary\nas a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce than\nvegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more likely\nto be unclean. But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more\nstrongly?\"\n\n\"How would Socialism change that?\" asked the girl-student, quickly. It\nwas the first time she had spoken.\n\n\"So long as we have wage slavery,\" answered Schliemann, \"it matters not\nin the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to\nfind people to perform it. But just as soon as labor is set free, then\nthe price of such work will begin to rise. So one by one the old, dingy,\nand unsanitary factories will come down--it will be cheaper to build\nnew; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking machinery, and\nso the dangerous trades will be made safe, or substitutes will be found\nfor their products. In exactly the same way, as the citizens of\nour Industrial Republic become refined, year by year the cost of\nslaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually those who want\nto eat meat will have to do their own killing--and how long do you think\nthe custom would survive then?--To go on to another item--one of the\nnecessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political\ncorruption; and one of the consequences of civic administration by\nignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable diseases kill off\nhalf our population. And even if science were allowed to try, it could\ndo little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings\nat all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others. They\nare penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and\nthe conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors\nin the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers\nof contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness\nimpossible for even the most selfish. For this reason I would seriously\nmaintain that all the medical and surgical discoveries that science can\nmake in the future will be of less importance than the application of\nthe knowledge we already possess, when the disinherited of the earth\nhave established their right to a human existence.\"\n\nAnd here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again. Jurgis had noticed\nthat the beautiful young girl who sat by the center-table was listening\nwith something of the same look that he himself had worn, the time when\nhe had first discovered Socialism. Jurgis would have liked to talk to\nher, he felt sure that she would have understood him. Later on in the\nevening, when the group broke up, he heard Mrs. Fisher say to her, in\na low voice, \"I wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same things\nabout Socialism\"; to which she answered, \"I don't know--but if he does\nwe shall know that he is a knave!\"\n\n\nAnd only a few hours after this came election day--when the long\ncampaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold\nits breath, awaiting the issue. Jurgis and the rest of the staff of\nHinds's Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they\nhurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening.\n\nBut already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph\ninstrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns. When the\nfinal accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four\nhundred thousand--an increase of something like three hundred and fifty\nper cent in four years. And that was doing well; but the party was\ndependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and\nnaturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones\nwhich felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall\nbelieved that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight\nhundred thousand. Just such an incredible increase had actually been\nmade in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700\nin 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and\nnow it was 69,000! So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in, the\nmeeting was a sight to be seen. Bulletins would be read, and the people\nwould shout themselves hoarse--and then some one would make a speech,\nand there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more\nbulletins. There would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring\nstates, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana had gone from\n2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of Ohio from 4,800\nto 36,000! There were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic\nindividuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented\nincreases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26 to 260; Henderson,\nKentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14 to 208; Cleo,\nOklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin's Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to 296--and many\nmore of the same kind. There were literally hundreds of such towns;\nthere would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of\ntelegrams. And the men who read the despatches off to the audience were\nold campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the\nvote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy, Illinois, from 189 to\n831--that was where the mayor had arrested a Socialist speaker! Crawford\nCounty, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was the home of the \"Appeal\nto Reason\"! Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the\nanswer of labor to the Citizens' Alliance Movement!\n\nAnd then there were official returns from the various precincts and\nwards of the city itself! Whether it was a factory district or one of\nthe \"silk-stocking\" wards seemed to make no particular difference in the\nincrease; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders\nmost was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards.\nPackingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the\nspring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600.\nNow, only one year later, it was over 6,300--and the Democratic vote\nonly 8,800! There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had\nbeen actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state\nlegislature had been elected. Thus Chicago now led the country; it had\nset a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!\n\n--So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes\nwere fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every\nsentence. The orator had been the head of the city's relief bureau in\nthe stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him\nsick. He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his\nlong arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of\nthe revolution. \"Organize! Organize! Organize!\"--that was his cry. He\nwas afraid of this tremendous vote, which his party had not expected,\nand which it had not earned. \"These men are not Socialists!\" he cried.\n\"This election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will\nforget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and\nrest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled to-day,\nand our enemies will laugh us to scorn! It rests with you to take your\nresolution--now, in the flush of victory, to find these men who have\nvoted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize them and bind\nthem to us! We shall not find all our campaigns as easy as this one.\nEverywhere in the country tonight the old party politicians are studying\nthis vote, and setting their sails by it; and nowhere will they be\nquicker or more cunning than here in our own city. Fifty thousand\nSocialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership Democracy in the\nspring! And then they will fool the voters once more, and all the powers\nof plunder and corruption will be swept into office again! But whatever\nthey may do when they get in, there is one thing they will not do, and\nthat will be the thing for which they were elected! They will not give\nthe people of our city municipal ownership--they will not mean to do it,\nthey will not try to do it; all that they will do is give our party\nin Chicago the greatest opportunity that has ever come to Socialism\nin America! We shall have the sham reformers self-stultified and\nself-convicted; we shall have the radical Democracy left without a lie\nwith which to cover its nakedness! And then will begin the rush that\nwill never be checked, the tide that will never turn till it has reached\nits flood--that will be irresistible, overwhelming--the rallying of the\noutraged workingmen of Chicago to our standard! And we shall organize\nthem, we shall drill them, we shall marshal them for the victory! We\nshall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us--and Chicago\nwill be ours! Chicago will be ours! CHICAGO WILL BE OURS!\"\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":6559.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 31","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201025054346\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/j\/the-jungle\/summary-and-analysis\/chapter-31","summary_text":"Soon after getting his job, Jurgis returns to Marija, imploring her to leave the brothel, but she refuses. She is addicted to morphine and cannot find work anywhere else. Jurgis reluctantly departs, returning home to a sick Elzbieta and her unruly sons, but this time, instead of leaving, Jurgis turns to socialism for support. Members of the Socialist Party in Chicago are preparing for the election. On the night before the vote, a millionaire sympathetic to the socialist movement invites Jurgis to dinner. Here Jurgis encounters Lucas, an evangelist, and Nicholas Schliemann, a former philosophy professor, who debate the nature of socialism while answering questions for a skeptical magazine editor. Jurgis attends a party gathering the next day to watch election returns. The Socialist Party makes substantial gains across the country, especially in Packingtown. One socialist leader interprets the results as a call for further organization by party members, for the voters may not really be socialists, but rather just disgruntled democrats. The Jungle closes with the orator inciting the crowd with chants of \"Chicago will be ours! CHICAGO WILL BE OURS!\"","summary_analysis":"Marija cannot leave her new life. This harsh reality is evident, and for her to do so would undermine everything else in the text. Although socialism is the only hope for the working person, Marija does not see this. She has reluctantly accepted the way of a capitalistic society and has become both unwilling and unable to change. New characters discuss the two major aspects of socialism -- its religious and scientific implications. Some embrace socialism as a new religion, replacing Christianity, while others favor the efficiency, rationality, and order of the new system, believing it superior to all other forms of government. The dialogue between Schliemann and Lucas does nothing to further the plot and does not include Jurgis at all; rather, they voice Sinclair's opinions, becoming a sounding board for the pro-socialist movement. The statistics at the end of the novel mirror actual results of the presidential election of 1904. Although the socialists view the number of votes they received as a significant increase from the past election, the actual number of votes was statistically quite low. In the original serial form of The Jungle, Jurgis is arrested on election night; however, this ending does not emphasize a socialist triumph, and Sinclair changed the ending when The Jungle was published in book form.

She is skeptical, but decides that anything that keeps Jurgis away from drink and makes him industrious is worth it. Jurgis begins looking for a job and fortunately comes to find one in a hotel as a porter. When Ostrinski learns of Jurgis's job, he tells him that the hotel owner is one of the most passionate Socialist Party members in the city. The hotel, owned by a man name Hinds, is a hotbed of Socialist activity. Hinds tells Jurgis of his own life and struggles and anytime he is faced with adversity he mutters: \"'Capitalism, my boy, Capitalism. Ecrasez l'Infame. The hotel employs a number of Socialist Party members and every night the employees get into intense arguments and debates with guests who defend systems of capitalism and individualism. Hinds explains how the Oil Trust, the Beef Trust, and the Railroad Trust actually own the country and the politicians. Some guests change their minds and attitudes towards socialism, and some do not. Jurgis begins to spend all his time and much of his money on spreading the Socialist cause, though he does occasionally fall into old habits of drink. At those times, he remembers, however, that it is a \"wicked thing to spend one's pennies for a drink, when the working-class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered. Jurgis attempts to convert his neighbors to socialism, though he makes many enemies and almost gets into a few fights during the process. The people tell Jurgis that socialism is \"paternalism,\" but Jurgis argues that by letting the capitalists rule the country and build the libraries and social structures, they are not allowing the workers to build their own country. Capitalism is true paternalism. Jurgis meets and hears a number of famous socialist speakers and writers. He meets the \"Little Giant,\" a little person who \"had written a veritable encyclopedia\" of Socialism. He hears a young author from California that had made a fortune selling books but that had never ceased to fight for the poor. He begins to read the \"Appeal to Reason,\" a tabloid newspaper that spreads the word of socialism through fantastical stories. Jurgis and the Socialist Party members distribute flyers and pamphlets telling the people of Packingtown what they can do to fight the Beef Trust when their strike fails. Feeling pressure, Mike Scully brings in the South Carolina \"pitchfork Senator\" to speak to the workers and to fight for the Republican Party. Jurgis stands up, however, and gives his own speech in the meeting, telling the crowd how he himself had been a part of the political machine that had bought votes and oppressed the voice of the people","The next morning, Jurgis goes to find Teta Elzbieta. He starts talking to her about socialism. Teta Elzbieta couldn't care less about whether or not socialism is right for the world. All she cares about is that Jurgis's new convictions mean that he plans to stay sober and look for a job. Once she figures that out, she encourages Jurgis's socialism as much as he wants. Jurgis starts looking for jobs at the various hotels in the neighborhood. A week later, Jurgis goes into the lobby of a hotel and approaches the owner. The owner asks Jurgis if he drinks. Jurgis says no, and the owner asks Jurgis if he is afraid of hard work. There's a job available for a night porter, but he'll have to do a lot of cleaning and hauling. Jurgis says that's fine. Jurgis tells Ostrinski he's gotten a job at a nearby hotel. Ostrinski is thrilled to hear that Jurgis has been hired at Hind's Hotel. Apparently, Tommy Hinds, the owner of this place, is a state organizer of the Socialist Party in Illinois. The next day, Jurgis informs his employer that he is also a socialist. Tommy Hinds shakes his hand. Tommy Hinds calls Jurgis \"Comrade Jurgis,\" and Jurgis calls his boss \"Comrade Hinds.\" Tommy Hinds frequently goes out to convince people to vote the socialist ticket to solve their troubles. He has a history as a union organizer and populist. After the 1896 election, in which Populist and Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan lost his campaign for president, Tommy Hinds gave up on the idea of wealth in private hands. Ever since then, he has been getting himself invited to every business meeting and church service in Chicago so that he can preach the value of socialism far and wide. Tommy Hinds's hotel is also a big source of pro-socialist political activity. His staff members are all socialists, and his chief clerk has been fighting the big railroad companies his whole life. His assistant clerk is Harry Adams, a smart guy from Massachusetts who moved down south to South Carolina and was horrified by the widespread illiteracy and poverty he found there. So he moved to Chicago and became a socialist. Oddly, the fact that this hotel is a socialist business doesn't mean it's not profitable. The hotel is inexpensive and gets plenty of out-of-towners looking for work in the stockyards who are too poor to afford lodging elsewhere. Tommy Hinds works to convert all of these new guys to the cause. He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards. Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him to get personal - he just wants Jurgis to explain the bad business and hygiene practices at these meatpacking plants. Tommy Hinds explains that it's not just the Beef Trust ; all business in the US is dominated by just a few super-powerful companies. The Standard Oil Company controls the price of oil and the Steel Trust overcharges on nails, and so on. Jurgis learns everything he needs to know about socialism working for Tommy Hinds. Because he has such faith in Tommy Hinds's views, Jurgis works harder and with more loyalty than he ever would have for the meatpackers. Jurgis does his best to convert his acquaintances to socialism. Still, he often finds himself almost getting into fights. Even though the benefits of socialism seem obvious to Jurgis, a lot of working people resist. They claim to prefer individualism, and resist the kind of control on their money that socialism would mean. Jurgis feels that these people are forgetting that the people who really benefit from individualism and capitalism are the steel, oil, and meat magnates. It's never the working guy who profits from free enterprise. Jurgis starts to read newspapers and to learn about America's history so that he can convince people to join the socialist cause. At socialist meetings, Jurgis meets a range of extraordinary organizers and great people who have sacrificed so much to join the cause of the working man. Jurgis becomes a regular reader of Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper with lots of tidbits about how the American working man suffers. They begin to distribute this newspaper in Packingtown after the union lost the strike there, so that workers can take hope. Jurgis also hands out Appeal to Reason in the stockyards in an effort to undo the damage he did when he was part of Mike Scully's political machine. The socialists are gaining a real political foothold in Packingtown, and Mike Scully and his political machine are on the run.","With his newfound faith and fire, Jurgis goes to see Elzbieta. She is not interested in his politics but notices the spark of industry in his eyes and tolerates his rhetoric. Soon Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a hotel, a hotel that, coincidentally, is a political hotbed of socialism. The proprietor of the hotel, Tommy Hinds, and his staff educate Jurgis and others in the ways and means of socialism. Gradually, socialism becomes the root of Jurgis' existence.","Jurgis visits Teta Elzbieta to tell her about socialism. She is happy to hear that he wishes to work and help support the family. She even agrees to attend socialist political meetings with him from time to time. Jurgis finds a job as a porter in a small hotel that pays thirty dollars a month plus board. Ostrinski informs Jurgis that his new boss, Tommy Hinds, is actually a state organizer for the socialist party and a well-known socialist speaker. Hinds is overjoyed to find that Jurgis is a comrade. Hinds never tires of preaching socialism in his hotel and elsewhere. Socialists flock to the hotel, so the radical philosophy of the proprietor does not hurt the business he owns. Hinds often urges Jurgis to detail the horrendous filth of the meat-packing plants along with the real recipes for tinned meats and sausages. Jurgis takes up the socialist cause with a passion. He endeavors to read newspapers, including The Appeal to Reason, and learn all about the political and economic systems of power in America. He becomes angry and frustrated when he cannot sway people to socialism"],"next summary id":"chapter 31","next chapter":"Soon after getting his job, Jurgis returns to Marija, imploring her to leave the brothel, but she refuses. She is addicted to morphine and cannot find work anywhere else. Jurgis reluctantly departs, returning home to a sick Elzbieta and her unruly sons, but this time, instead of leaving, Jurgis turns to socialism for support. Members of the Socialist Party in Chicago are preparing for the election. On the night before the vote, a millionaire sympathetic to the socialist movement invites Jurgis to dinner. Here Jurgis encounters Lucas, an evangelist, and Nicholas Schliemann, a former philosophy professor, who debate the nature of socialism while answering questions for a skeptical magazine editor. Jurgis attends a party gathering the next day to watch election returns. The Socialist Party makes substantial gains across the country, especially in Packingtown. One socialist leader interprets the results as a call for further organization by party members, for the voters may not really be socialists, but rather just disgruntled democrats.

She plans to remain a prostitute for the rest of her life. Jurgis attends a meeting with a magazine editor who opposes socialism but has agreed to listen to some proponents of the movement. Jurgis's role is to detail the unsanitary conditions under which meat is packed and sold to the public. Nicholas Schliemann, a fierce socialist, explains that the movement wishes to enact public ownership of the means of production. Once the inefficiency of production is eliminated through science and eradication of graft, no worker will be obliged to labor for countless hours a day merely to survive. He can work as little as two hours a day and devote the rest of his time to his personal interests. The basic goals of socialism are \\\"common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life. The means to bring about this revolution is to raise the class consciousness of the proletariat around the world through political organization. Later, the socialist party achieves phenomenal victories in the elections across the country. A spirited speaker at a political meeting urges socialists to continue fighting because the victory is not yet won, encouraging them with the words, \\\"Chicago will be ours\", \"analysis\": \"The final chapters of The Jungle largely abandon the narrative, functioning as an explanation and an argument for socialism. Insofar as they tell a story, it is the story of Jurgis's process of conversion to socialism. The newly introduced Ostrinski and Schliemann are less dramatic characters than mouthpieces for socialism. The ending of The Jungle is, to a great extent, meant to be simplistic. Sinclair's aim, after all, is not to present the complicated nuances of actual political and economic practices but to persuade the reader to adopt his opinions. The lack of literary sophistication in the ending is obvious, but it is also questionable whether the simplistic ending and the one-dimensional story in general make for the most persuasive political argument. One can argue that the credibility of the novel as reportage becomes doubtful as it begins to resemble propaganda. Sinclair closes his sharp eye for detail when he examines socialism, and the effect stunts the humanity of the people whom he wants to liberate. Ironically, the peoples' movement seems devoid of real human beings. If Sinclair wants the reader to identify with his socialists, he fails because there is no real human being with whom to identify. Jurgis, a constricted character to begin with, almost disappears, and the new characters are flatter than any that Sinclair has offered so far. The shift to pure propaganda in the final chapters occasions several awkward ruptures in the narrative perspective. Throughout The Jungle, Sinclair narrates events as seen through the eyes of Jurgis, though he sometimes employs a more omniscient perspective to describe business dealings and social problems that Jurgis doesn't witness. In an attempt to weave these passages into the narrative fabric, Sinclair has Jurgis learn of them at some unspecified future point in time. As the volume of political argument increases in the final chapters, the interweaving of political commentary and narrative structure becomes more forced. Sinclair recounts that \\\"after Jurgis had made himself more familiar with the Socialist literature, as he would very quickly, he would get glimpses of the Beef Trust from all sorts of aspects . . .\\\"; a lengthy polemic against the Beef Trust then follows, as if it comprises the knowledge that Sinclair claims that Jurgis gains. The meetings that Jurgis attends provide another forum for Sinclair to air his politics, as does the literature that Jurgis reads. These framing devices are sites of tension between Sinclair's politics and the demands of literary composition. Sinclair wants to make his argument in as blunt a language as possible, but the work of fiction has its own laws of internal consistency. The journalistic style that Sinclair employs requires realism. Moreover, a narrative perspective that filters events and ideas through the experience of the protagonist must do so consistently or risk breaking apart. The framing devices show that Sinclair feels these demands. He knows that information about the Beef Trust cannot simply be inserted into the text; rather, its presence has to be justified in the narrative structure. Thus, Jurgis learns about the Beef Trust at some future, unspecified point, and Sinclair is free to rail against it. One can argue again, however, that these framing devices are too cheap to be effective. They are usually a single sentence, an afterthought. Perhaps their real failure, though, lies in the fact that they do not control the information that follows. They claim that what follows is witnessed or learned by Jurgis, but Jurgis's perspective disappears in the subsequent argument. The reader doesn't learn how Jurgis, in particular, receives what he learns from socialist literature. Jurgis doesn't filter events and information through his subjectivity; he is simply a conduit: \\\"Such was the home in which Jurgis lived and worked. . . .\\\" His character, one might argue, becomes not only flat but hollow.\"}","chapter":"\n\nOne of the first things that Jurgis had done after he got a job was to\ngo and see Marija. She came down into the basement of the house to meet\nhim, and he stood by the door with his hat in his hand, saying, \"I've\ngot work now, and so you can leave here.\"\n\nBut Marija only shook her head. There was nothing else for her to\ndo, she said, and nobody to employ her. She could not keep her past a\nsecret--girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were\nthousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she would\nmeet one of them. \"And besides,\" Marija added, \"I can't do anything. I'm\nno good--I take dope. What could you do with me?\"\n\n\"Can't you stop?\" Jurgis cried.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I'll never stop. What's the use of talking about\nit--I'll stay here till I die, I guess. It's all I'm fit for.\" And that\nwas all that he could get her to say--there was no use trying. When\nhe told her he would not let Elzbieta take her money, she answered\nindifferently: \"Then it'll be wasted here--that's all.\" Her eyelids\nlooked heavy and her face was red and swollen; he saw that he was\nannoying her, that she only wanted him to go away. So he went,\ndisappointed and sad.\n\nPoor Jurgis was not very happy in his home-life. Elzbieta was sick a\ngood deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the\nworse for their life upon the streets. But he stuck by the family\nnevertheless, for they reminded him of his old happiness; and when\nthings went wrong he could solace himself with a plunge into the\nSocialist movement. Since his life had been caught up into the current\nof this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life\nto him came to seem of relatively slight importance; his interests were\nelsewhere, in the world of ideas. His outward life was commonplace and\nuninteresting; he was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one\nwhile he lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his life was a\nperpetual adventure. There was so much to know--so many wonders to\nbe discovered! Never in all his life did Jurgis forget the day before\nelection, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry\nAdams, asking him to bring Jurgis to see him that night; and Jurgis\nwent, and met one of the minds of the movement.\n\nThe invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who\nhad given up his life to settlement work, and had a little home in the\nheart of the city's slums. He did not belong to the party, but he was\nin sympathy with it; and he said that he was to have as his guest that\nnight the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against Socialism,\nbut really did not know what it was. The millionaire suggested that\nAdams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject of \"pure food,\"\nin which the editor was interested.\n\nYoung Fisher's home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and\nweather-beaten outside, but attractive within. The room that Jurgis saw\nwas half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly\nvisible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a\nlog fire was crackling in the open hearth. Seven or eight people were\ngathered about it when Adams and his friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to\nhis dismay that three of them were ladies. He had never talked to people\nof this sort before, and he fell into an agony of embarrassment. He\nstood in the doorway clutching his hat tightly in his hands, and made a\ndeep bow to each of the persons as he was introduced; then, when he was\nasked to have a seat, he took a chair in a dark corner, and sat down\nupon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his forehead with\nhis sleeve. He was terrified lest they should expect him to talk.\n\nThere was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening\ndress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named\nMaynard. There was the former's frail young wife, and also an elderly\nlady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college\nstudent, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face. She only\nspoke once or twice while Jurgis was there--the rest of the time she sat\nby the table in the center of the room, resting her chin in her hands\nand drinking in the conversation. There were two other men, whom young\nFisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Schliemann; he\nheard them address Adams as \"Comrade,\" and so he knew that they were\nSocialists.\n\nThe one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of\nclerical aspect; he had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired,\nand had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation.\nHe traveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon\nhospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall.\nThe other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor when\nAdams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they resumed\nit after the interruption. Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound, thinking\nthat here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in the world.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands\nand bristling yellow beard; he was a university man, and had been a\nprofessor of philosophy--until, as he said, he had found that he was\nselling his character as well as his time. Instead he had come to\nAmerica, where he lived in a garret room in this slum district, and made\nvolcanic energy take the place of fire. He studied the composition of\nfood-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates his\nbody needed; and by scientific chewing he said that he tripled the value\nof all he ate, so that it cost him eleven cents a day. About the first\nof July he would leave Chicago for his vacation, on foot; and when he\nstruck the harvest fields he would set to work for two dollars and a\nhalf a day, and come home when he had another year's supply--a hundred\nand twenty-five dollars. That was the nearest approach to independence\na man could make \"under capitalism,\" he explained; he would never marry,\nfor no sane man would allow himself to fall in love until after the\nrevolution.\n\nHe sat in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed, and his head so far in\nthe shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the fire\non the hearth. He spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with the\nmanner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom in\ngeometry, he would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of\nan ordinary person rise on end. And when the auditor had asserted\nhis non-comprehension, he would proceed to elucidate by some new\nproposition, yet more appalling. To Jurgis the Herr Dr. Schliemann\nassumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake. And yet,\nstrange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he\ncould follow the argument nearly all the time. He was carried over the\ndifficult places in spite of himself; and he went plunging away in mad\ncareer--a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation.\n\nNicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man\nas a small part of it. He understood human institutions, and blew them\nabout like soap bubbles. It was surprising that so much destructiveness\ncould be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose\nof government was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation\nof ancient force and modern fraud. Or was it marriage? Marriage\nand prostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man's\nexploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a\ndifference of class. If a woman had money she might dictate her own\nterms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy--that is, the\nproperty-rights--of her children. If she had no money, she was a\nproletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject\nbecame Religion, which was the Archfiend's deadliest weapon. Government\noppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind,\nand poisoned the stream of progress at its source. The working-man was\nto fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in\nthis one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience--in short\nto all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism. The destiny of civilization\nwould be decided in one final death struggle between the Red\nInternational and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic\nChurch; while here at home, \"the stygian midnight of American\nevangelicalism--\"\n\nAnd here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively\ntussle. \"Comrade\" Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he knew\nonly the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience. And\nwhat was the use, he asked, of confusing Religion with men's perversions\nof it? That the church was in the hands of the merchants at the moment\nwas obvious enough; but already there were signs of rebellion, and if\nComrade Schliemann could come back a few years from now--\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said the other, \"of course, I have no doubt that in a hundred\nyears the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed Socialism, just\nas at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.\"\n\n\"I am not defending the Vatican,\" exclaimed Lucas, vehemently. \"I am\ndefending the word of God--which is one long cry of the human spirit for\ndeliverance from the sway of oppression. Take the twenty-fourth chapter\nof the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as\n'the Bible upon the Beef Trust'; or take the words of Isaiah--or of the\nMaster himself! Not the elegant prince of our debauched and vicious art,\nnot the jeweled idol of our society churches--but the Jesus of the awful\nreality, the man of sorrow and pain, the outcast, despised of the world,\nwho had nowhere to lay his head--\"\n\n\"I will grant you Jesus,\" interrupted the other.\n\n\"Well, then,\" cried Lucas, \"and why should Jesus have nothing to do with\nhis church--why should his words and his life be of no authority among\nthose who profess to adore him? Here is a man who was the world's first\nrevolutionist, the true founder of the Socialist movement; a man whose\nwhole being was one flame of hatred for wealth, and all that wealth\nstands for,--for the pride of wealth, and the luxury of wealth, and the\ntyranny of wealth; who was himself a beggar and a tramp, a man of the\npeople, an associate of saloon-keepers and women of the town; who again\nand again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth and\nthe holding of wealth: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures on\nearth!'--'Sell that ye have and give alms!'--'Blessed are ye poor, for\nyours is the kingdom of Heaven!'--'Woe unto you that are rich, for ye\nhave received your consolation!'--'Verily, I say unto you, that a rich\nman shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven!' Who denounced in\nunmeasured terms the exploiters of his own time: 'Woe unto you, scribes\nand pharisees, hypocrites!'--'Woe unto you also, you lawyers!'--'Ye\nserpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of\nhell?' Who drove out the business men and brokers from the temple with a\nwhip! Who was crucified--think of it--for an incendiary and a disturber\nof the social order! And this man they have made into the high priest of\nproperty and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the horrors\nand abominations of modern commercial civilization! Jeweled images are\nmade of him, sensual priests burn incense to him, and modern pirates of\nindustry bring their dollars, wrung from the toil of helpless women\nand children, and build temples to him, and sit in cushioned seats and\nlisten to his teachings expounded by doctors of dusty divinity--\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Schliemann, laughing. But the other was in full\ncareer--he had talked this subject every day for five years, and had\nnever yet let himself be stopped. \"This Jesus of Nazareth!\" he cried.\n\"This class-conscious working-man! This union carpenter! This agitator,\nlaw-breaker, firebrand, anarchist! He, the sovereign lord and master\nof a world which grinds the bodies and souls of human beings into\ndollars--if he could come into the world this day and see the things\nthat men have made in his name, would it not blast his soul with horror?\nWould he not go mad at the sight of it, he the Prince of Mercy and Love!\nThat dreadful night when he lay in the Garden of Gethsemane and writhed\nin agony until he sweat blood--do you think that he saw anything worse\nthan he might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria, where men march\nout with a jeweled image of him before them, to do wholesale murder for\nthe benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and cruelty? Do you not know\nthat if he were in St. Petersburg now, he would take the whip with which\nhe drove out the bankers from his temple--\"\n\nHere the speaker paused an instant for breath. \"No, comrade,\" said the\nother, dryly, \"for he was a practical man. He would take pretty little\nimitation lemons, such as are now being shipped into Russia, handy for\ncarrying in the pockets, and strong enough to blow a whole temple out of\nsight.\"\n\nLucas waited until the company had stopped laughing over this; then\nhe began again: \"But look at it from the point of view of practical\npolitics, comrade. Here is an historical figure whom all men reverence\nand love, whom some regard as divine; and who was one of us--who lived\nour life, and taught our doctrine. And now shall we leave him in the\nhands of his enemies--shall we allow them to stifle and stultify his\nexample? We have his words, which no one can deny; and shall we not\nquote them to the people, and prove to them what he was, and what he\ntaught, and what he did? No, no, a thousand times no!--we shall use his\nauthority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his ministry, and we\nshall yet rouse the people to action!--\"\n\nLucas halted again; and the other stretched out his hand to a paper on\nthe table. \"Here, comrade,\" he said, with a laugh, \"here is a place for\nyou to begin. A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty thousand\ndollars' worth of diamonds! And a most unctuous and oily of bishops!\nAn eminent and scholarly bishop! A philanthropist and friend of labor\nbishop--a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of the\nwage-working-man!\"\n\nTo this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as\nspectators. But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark,\nsomewhat naively, that he had always understood that Socialists had a\ncut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were\ntwo active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were\nagreed about nothing at all. Would the two, for his enlightenment, try\nto ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the\nsame party? This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of\ntwo carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in\nthe common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing\nthe necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist believes that\nthe means by which this is to be brought about is the class conscious\npolitical organization of the wage-earners. Thus far they were at\none; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the co-operative\ncommonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven, which is\n\"within you.\" To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary step toward\na far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience. Schliemann\ncalled himself a \"philosophic anarchist\"; and he explained that an\nanarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence was the\nfree development of every personality, unrestricted by laws save those\nof its own being. Since the same kind of match would light every one's\nfire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every one's stomach,\nit would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the control of a\nmajority vote. There was only one earth, and the quantity of material\nthings was limited. Of intellectual and moral things, on the other hand,\nthere was no limit, and one could have more without another's\nhaving less; hence \"Communism in material production, anarchism in\nintellectual,\" was the formula of modern proletarian thought. As soon\nas the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society had been healed,\nthere would be established a simple system whereby each man was credited\nwith his labor and debited with his purchases; and after that the\nprocesses of production, exchange, and consumption would go on\nautomatically, and without our being conscious of them, any more than\na man is conscious of the beating of his heart. And then, explained\nSchliemann, society would break up into independent, self-governing\ncommunities of mutually congenial persons; examples of which at present\nwere clubs, churches, and political parties. After the revolution, all\nthe intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be\ncared for by such \"free associations\"; romantic novelists would be\nsupported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist\npainters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist\npictures--and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors\nand musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could\nfind no one to maintain him, he could support himself by working part of\nthe time. That was the case at present, the only difference being that\nthe competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to\nlive, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any\none would be able to support himself by an hour's work a day. Also the\nartist's audience of the present was a small minority of people, all\ndebased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the\ncommercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which\nwould result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare\nof competition, we could at present form no conception whatever.\n\nAnd then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann\nasserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour's\ntoil by each of its members. \"Just what,\" answered the other, \"would be\nthe productive capacity of society if the present resources of science\nwere utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may be sure it\nwould exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds inured to\nthe ferocious barbarities of capitalism. After the triumph of the\ninternational proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and\nwho can figure the cost of war to humanity--not merely the value of the\nlives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping\nmillions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle\nand parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the\nwar attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the\ndrunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial\nimpotence and the moral deadness? Do you think that it would be too much\nto say that two hours of the working time of every efficient member of a\ncommunity goes to feed the red fiend of war?\"\n\nAnd then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of\ncompetition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and\nfriction; the vices--such as drink, for instance, the use of which had\nnearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification\nof the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the\ncommunity, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the\nwhole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the\nmilliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and\nlackeys. \"You understand,\" he said, \"that in a society dominated by\nthe fact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of\nprowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power. So we have,\nat the present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the\npopulation occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent\noccupied in destroying them. And this is not all; for the servants\nand panders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the\njewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful members\nof the community. And bear in mind also that this monstrous disease\naffects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison penetrates\nthe whole social body. Beneath the hundred thousand women of the elite\nare a million middle-class women, miserable because they are not of the\nelite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath them, in turn,\nare five million farmers' wives reading 'fashion papers' and trimming\nbonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling themselves into\nbrothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin robes. And then\nconsider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like\noil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling! You have\nmanufacturers contriving tens of thousands of catchpenny devices,\nstorekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and magazines filled up\nwith advertisements of them!\"\n\n\"And don't forget the wastes of fraud,\" put in young Fisher.\n\n\"When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,\"\nresponded Schliemann--\"the science of persuading people to buy what they\ndo not want--he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house\nof capitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen\nhorrors to point out first. But consider the waste in time and energy\nincidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes\nof ostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use!\nConsider all the waste incidental to the manufacture of cheap qualities\nof goods, of goods made to sell and deceive the ignorant; consider the\nwastes of adulteration,--the shoddy clothing, the cotton blankets, the\nunstable tenements, the ground-cork life-preservers, the adulterated\nmilk, the aniline soda water, the potato-flour sausages--\"\n\n\"And consider the moral aspects of the thing,\" put in the ex-preacher.\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Schliemann; \"the low knavery and the ferocious cruelty\nincidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing, the\nblustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and\nworrying. Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of\ncompetition--they are but another form of the phrase 'to buy in the\ncheapest market and sell in the dearest.' A government official has\nstated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter dollars\na year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not only\nmaterials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human\nstomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have\nbeen well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years\nbefore the proper time. Then again, consider the waste of time and\nenergy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would\ndo. There are a million or two of business firms in the country,\nand five or ten times as many clerks; and consider the handling and\nrehandling, the accounting and reaccounting, the planning and worrying,\nthe balancing of petty profit and loss. Consider the whole machinery\nof the civil law made necessary by these processes; the libraries of\nponderous tomes, the courts and juries to interpret them, the lawyers\nstudying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the hatreds\nand lies! Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and haphazard\nproduction of commodities--the factories closed, the workers idle,\nthe goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the stock\nmanipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the overstimulation of\nothers, for speculative purposes; the assignments and bank failures,\nthe crises and panics, the deserted towns and the starving populations!\nConsider the energies wasted in the seeking of markets, the sterile\ntrades, such as drummer, solicitor, bill-poster, advertising agent.\nConsider the wastes incidental to the crowding into cities, made\nnecessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates; consider\nthe slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital energies;\nconsider the office buildings, the waste of time and material in the\npiling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground! Then take\nthe whole business of insurance, the enormous mass of administrative and\nclerical labor it involves, and all utter waste--\"\n\n\"I do not follow that,\" said the editor. \"The Cooperative Commonwealth\nis a universal automatic insurance company and savings bank for all its\nmembers. Capital being the property of all, injury to it is shared\nby all and made up by all. The bank is the universal government\ncredit-account, the ledger in which every individual's earnings and\nspendings are balanced. There is also a universal government bulletin,\nin which are listed and precisely described everything which the\ncommonwealth has for sale. As no one makes any profit by the sale, there\nis no longer any stimulus to extravagance, and no misrepresentation; no\ncheating, no adulteration or imitation, no bribery or 'grafting.'\"\n\n\"How is the price of an article determined?\"\n\n\"The price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is\ndetermined by the first principles of arithmetic. The million workers in\nthe nation's wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the total\nproduct of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a bushel of\nwheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day. If we employ an arbitrary\nsymbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then the cost of\na bushel of wheat is fifty cents.\"\n\n\"You say 'for farm work,'\" said Mr. Maynard. \"Then labor is not to be\npaid alike?\"\n\n\"Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should\nhave millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners. Of course the\nwages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will\nhave to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of\nworkers is needed in any particular industry. That is precisely what is\ndone at present, except that the transfer of the workers is accomplished\nblindly and imperfectly, by rumors and advertisements, instead of\ninstantly and completely, by a universal government bulletin.\"\n\n\"How about those occupations in which time is difficult to calculate?\nWhat is the labor cost of a book?\"\n\n\"Obviously it is the labor cost of the paper, printing, and binding of\nit--about a fifth of its present cost.\"\n\n\"And the author?\"\n\n\"I have already said that the state could not control intellectual\nproduction. The state might say that it had taken a year to write the\nbook, and the author might say it had taken thirty. Goethe said that\nevery bon mot of his had cost a purse of gold. What I outline here is\na national, or rather international, system for the providing of the\nmaterial needs of men. Since a man has intellectual needs also, he will\nwork longer, earn more, and provide for them to his own taste and in his\nown way. I live on the same earth as the majority, I wear the same kind\nof shoes and sleep in the same kind of bed; but I do not think the same\nkind of thoughts, and I do not wish to pay for such thinkers as the\nmajority selects. I wish such things to be left to free effort, as\nat present. If people want to listen to a certain preacher, they get\ntogether and contribute what they please, and pay for a church and\nsupport the preacher, and then listen to him; I, who do not want to\nlisten to him, stay away, and it costs me nothing. In the same way there\nare magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and flying\nmachines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of them.\nOn the other hand, if wage slavery were abolished, and I could earn some\nspare money without paying tribute to an exploiting capitalist,\nthen there would be a magazine for the purpose of interpreting\nand popularizing the gospel of Friedrich Nietzsche, the prophet of\nEvolution, and also of Horace Fletcher, the inventor of the noble\nscience of clean eating; and incidentally, perhaps, for the discouraging\nof long skirts, and the scientific breeding of men and women, and the\nestablishing of divorce by mutual consent.\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused for a moment. \"That was a lecture,\" he said with a\nlaugh, \"and yet I am only begun!\"\n\n\"What else is there?\" asked Maynard.\n\n\"I have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,\"\nanswered the other. \"I have hardly mentioned the positive economies\nof co-operation. Allowing five to a family, there are fifteen million\nfamilies in this country; and at least ten million of these live\nseparately, the domestic drudge being either the wife or a wage slave.\nNow set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the\neconomies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the\nwashing of dishes. Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing\nfor a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a day's\nwork, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied persons--mostly\nwomen to do the dish-washing of the country. And note that this is most\nfilthy and deadening and brutalizing work; that it is a cause of anemia,\nnervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of prostitution, suicide, and\ninsanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate children--for all of which\nthings the community has naturally to pay. And now consider that in each\nof my little free communities there would be a machine which would wash\nand dry the dishes, and do it, not merely to the eye and the touch,\nbut scientifically--sterilizing them--and do it at a saving of all the\ndrudgery and nine-tenths of the time! All of these things you may\nfind in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take Kropotkin's Fields,\nFactories, and Workshops, and read about the new science of agriculture,\nwhich has been built up in the last ten years; by which, with made soils\nand intensive culture, a gardener can raise ten or twelve crops in a\nseason, and two hundred tons of vegetables upon a single acre; by which\nthe population of the whole globe could be supported on the soil now\ncultivated in the United States alone! It is impossible to apply such\nmethods now, owing to the ignorance and poverty of our scattered farming\npopulation; but imagine the problem of providing the food supply of our\nnation once taken in hand systematically and rationally, by scientists!\nAll the poor and rocky land set apart for a national timber reserve, in\nwhich our children play, and our young men hunt, and our poets dwell!\nThe most favorable climate and soil for each product selected; the\nexact requirements of the community known, and the acreage figured\naccordingly; the most improved machinery employed, under the direction\nof expert agricultural chemists! I was brought up on a farm, and I know\nthe awful deadliness of farm work; and I like to picture it all as\nit will be after the revolution. To picture the great potato-planting\nmachine, drawn by four horses, or an electric motor, ploughing the\nfurrow, cutting and dropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a\nscore of acres a day! To picture the great potato-digging machine,\nrun by electricity, perhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field,\nscooping up earth and potatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks! To\nevery other kind of vegetable and fruit handled in the same way--apples\nand oranges picked by machinery, cows milked by electricity--things\nwhich are already done, as you may know. To picture the harvest fields\nof the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a\nsummer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to\neach place! And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system\nof independent small farming,--a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated\nwith a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o'clock\nin the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they\nare able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut\nout from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and\ninvention, and all the joys of the spirit--held to a bare existence\nby competition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too\nblind to see his chains!\"\n\nDr. Schliemann paused a moment. \"And then,\" he continued, \"place\nbeside this fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of\nphysiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to\noverfeeding! And then again, it has been proven that meat is unnecessary\nas a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce than\nvegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more likely\nto be unclean. But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more\nstrongly?\"\n\n\"How would Socialism change that?\" asked the girl-student, quickly. It\nwas the first time she had spoken.\n\n\"So long as we have wage slavery,\" answered Schliemann, \"it matters not\nin the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to\nfind people to perform it. But just as soon as labor is set free, then\nthe price of such work will begin to rise. So one by one the old, dingy,\nand unsanitary factories will come down--it will be cheaper to build\nnew; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking machinery, and\nso the dangerous trades will be made safe, or substitutes will be found\nfor their products. In exactly the same way, as the citizens of\nour Industrial Republic become refined, year by year the cost of\nslaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually those who want\nto eat meat will have to do their own killing--and how long do you think\nthe custom would survive then?--To go on to another item--one of the\nnecessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political\ncorruption; and one of the consequences of civic administration by\nignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable diseases kill off\nhalf our population. And even if science were allowed to try, it could\ndo little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings\nat all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others. They\nare penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and\nthe conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors\nin the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers\nof contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness\nimpossible for even the most selfish. For this reason I would seriously\nmaintain that all the medical and surgical discoveries that science can\nmake in the future will be of less importance than the application of\nthe knowledge we already possess, when the disinherited of the earth\nhave established their right to a human existence.\"\n\nAnd here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again. Jurgis had noticed\nthat the beautiful young girl who sat by the center-table was listening\nwith something of the same look that he himself had worn, the time when\nhe had first discovered Socialism. Jurgis would have liked to talk to\nher, he felt sure that she would have understood him. Later on in the\nevening, when the group broke up, he heard Mrs. Fisher say to her, in\na low voice, \"I wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same things\nabout Socialism\"; to which she answered, \"I don't know--but if he does\nwe shall know that he is a knave!\"\n\n\nAnd only a few hours after this came election day--when the long\ncampaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold\nits breath, awaiting the issue. Jurgis and the rest of the staff of\nHinds's Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they\nhurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening.\n\nBut already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph\ninstrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns. When the\nfinal accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four\nhundred thousand--an increase of something like three hundred and fifty\nper cent in four years. And that was doing well; but the party was\ndependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and\nnaturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones\nwhich felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall\nbelieved that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight\nhundred thousand. Just such an incredible increase had actually been\nmade in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700\nin 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and\nnow it was 69,000! So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in, the\nmeeting was a sight to be seen. Bulletins would be read, and the people\nwould shout themselves hoarse--and then some one would make a speech,\nand there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more\nbulletins. There would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring\nstates, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana had gone from\n2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of Ohio from 4,800\nto 36,000! There were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic\nindividuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented\nincreases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26 to 260; Henderson,\nKentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14 to 208; Cleo,\nOklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin's Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to 296--and many\nmore of the same kind. There were literally hundreds of such towns;\nthere would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of\ntelegrams. And the men who read the despatches off to the audience were\nold campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the\nvote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy, Illinois, from 189 to\n831--that was where the mayor had arrested a Socialist speaker! Crawford\nCounty, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was the home of the \"Appeal\nto Reason\"! Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the\nanswer of labor to the Citizens' Alliance Movement!\n\nAnd then there were official returns from the various precincts and\nwards of the city itself! Whether it was a factory district or one of\nthe \"silk-stocking\" wards seemed to make no particular difference in the\nincrease; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders\nmost was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards.\nPackingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the\nspring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600.\nNow, only one year later, it was over 6,300--and the Democratic vote\nonly 8,800! There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had\nbeen actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state\nlegislature had been elected. Thus Chicago now led the country; it had\nset a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!\n\n--So spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes\nwere fixed upon him, and two thousand voices were cheering his every\nsentence. The orator had been the head of the city's relief bureau in\nthe stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him\nsick. He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his\nlong arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of\nthe revolution. \"Organize! Organize! Organize!\"--that was his cry. He\nwas afraid of this tremendous vote, which his party had not expected,\nand which it had not earned. \"These men are not Socialists!\" he cried.\n\"This election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will\nforget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and\nrest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled to-day,\nand our enemies will laugh us to scorn! It rests with you to take your\nresolution--now, in the flush of victory, to find these men who have\nvoted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize them and bind\nthem to us! We shall not find all our campaigns as easy as this one.\nEverywhere in the country tonight the old party politicians are studying\nthis vote, and setting their sails by it; and nowhere will they be\nquicker or more cunning than here in our own city. Fifty thousand\nSocialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership Democracy in the\nspring! And then they will fool the voters once more, and all the powers\nof plunder and corruption will be swept into office again! But whatever\nthey may do when they get in, there is one thing they will not do, and\nthat will be the thing for which they were elected! They will not give\nthe people of our city municipal ownership--they will not mean to do it,\nthey will not try to do it; all that they will do is give our party\nin Chicago the greatest opportunity that has ever come to Socialism\nin America! We shall have the sham reformers self-stultified and\nself-convicted; we shall have the radical Democracy left without a lie\nwith which to cover its nakedness! And then will begin the rush that\nwill never be checked, the tide that will never turn till it has reached\nits flood--that will be irresistible, overwhelming--the rallying of the\noutraged workingmen of Chicago to our standard! And we shall organize\nthem, we shall drill them, we shall marshal them for the victory! We\nshall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us--and Chicago\nwill be ours! Chicago will be ours! CHICAGO WILL BE OURS!\"\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":6559.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 31","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210119013110\/https:\/\/www.sparknotes.com\/lit\/jungle\/section10\/","summary_text":"Jurgis attempts to persuade Marija to leave prostitution, but she explains that she cannot because she is addicted to morphine. She plans to remain a prostitute for the rest of her life. Jurgis attends a meeting with a magazine editor who opposes socialism but has agreed to listen to some proponents of the movement. Jurgis's role is to detail the unsanitary conditions under which meat is packed and sold to the public. Nicholas Schliemann, a fierce socialist, explains that the movement wishes to enact public ownership of the means of production. Once the inefficiency of production is eliminated through science and eradication of graft, no worker will be obliged to labor for countless hours a day merely to survive. He can work as little as two hours a day and devote the rest of his time to his personal interests. The basic goals of socialism are \"common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life. The means to bring about this revolution is to raise the class consciousness of the proletariat around the world through political organization. Later, the socialist party achieves phenomenal victories in the elections across the country. A spirited speaker at a political meeting urges socialists to continue fighting because the victory is not yet won, encouraging them with the words, \"Chicago will be ours","summary_analysis":"The final chapters of The Jungle largely abandon the narrative, functioning as an explanation and an argument for socialism. Insofar as they tell a story, it is the story of Jurgis's process of conversion to socialism. The newly introduced Ostrinski and Schliemann are less dramatic characters than mouthpieces for socialism. The ending of The Jungle is, to a great extent, meant to be simplistic. Sinclair's aim, after all, is not to present the complicated nuances of actual political and economic practices but to persuade the reader to adopt his opinions. The lack of literary sophistication in the ending is obvious, but it is also questionable whether the simplistic ending and the one-dimensional story in general make for the most persuasive political argument. One can argue that the credibility of the novel as reportage becomes doubtful as it begins to resemble propaganda. Sinclair closes his sharp eye for detail when he examines socialism, and the effect stunts the humanity of the people whom he wants to liberate. Ironically, the peoples' movement seems devoid of real human beings. If Sinclair wants the reader to identify with his socialists, he fails because there is no real human being with whom to identify. Jurgis, a constricted character to begin with, almost disappears, and the new characters are flatter than any that Sinclair has offered so far. The shift to pure propaganda in the final chapters occasions several awkward ruptures in the narrative perspective. Throughout The Jungle, Sinclair narrates events as seen through the eyes of Jurgis, though he sometimes employs a more omniscient perspective to describe business dealings and social problems that Jurgis doesn't witness. In an attempt to weave these passages into the narrative fabric, Sinclair has Jurgis learn of them at some unspecified future point in time. As the volume of political argument increases in the final chapters, the interweaving of political commentary and narrative structure becomes more forced. Sinclair recounts that \"after Jurgis had made himself more familiar with the Socialist literature, as he would very quickly, he would get glimpses of the Beef Trust from all sorts of aspects . . .\"; a lengthy polemic against the Beef Trust then follows, as if it comprises the knowledge that Sinclair claims that Jurgis gains. The meetings that Jurgis attends provide another forum for Sinclair to air his politics, as does the literature that Jurgis reads. These framing devices are sites of tension between Sinclair's politics and the demands of literary composition. Sinclair wants to make his argument in as blunt a language as possible, but the work of fiction has its own laws of internal consistency. The journalistic style that Sinclair employs requires realism. Moreover, a narrative perspective that filters events and ideas through the experience of the protagonist must do so consistently or risk breaking apart. The framing devices show that Sinclair feels these demands. He knows that information about the Beef Trust cannot simply be inserted into the text; rather, its presence has to be justified in the narrative structure. Thus, Jurgis learns about the Beef Trust at some future, unspecified point, and Sinclair is free to rail against it. One can argue again, however, that these framing devices are too cheap to be effective. They are usually a single sentence, an afterthought. Perhaps their real failure, though, lies in the fact that they do not control the information that follows. They claim that what follows is witnessed or learned by Jurgis, but Jurgis's perspective disappears in the subsequent argument. The reader doesn't learn how Jurgis, in particular, receives what he learns from socialist literature. Jurgis doesn't filter events and information through his subjectivity; he is simply a conduit: \"Such was the home in which Jurgis lived and worked. . . .\" His character, one might argue, becomes not only flat but hollow.","summary_length":223.0,"analysis_length":634.0,"chap_int":31,"previous summary id":["chapter 30","chapter 30","chapter 30","chapter 30"],"previous chapter":["Jurgis, now awakened by Socialism, returns to Elzbieta's house where he attempts to convince her of the system's merits. She is skeptical, but decides that anything that keeps Jurgis away from drink and makes him industrious is worth it. Jurgis begins looking for a job and fortunately comes to find one in a hotel as a porter. When Ostrinski learns of Jurgis's job, he tells him that the hotel owner is one of the most passionate Socialist Party members in the city. The hotel, owned by a man name Hinds, is a hotbed of Socialist activity. Hinds tells Jurgis of his own life and struggles and anytime he is faced with adversity he mutters: \"'Capitalism, my boy, Capitalism. Ecrasez l'Infame. The hotel employs a number of Socialist Party members and every night the employees get into intense arguments and debates with guests who defend systems of capitalism and individualism. Hinds explains how the Oil Trust, the Beef Trust, and the Railroad Trust actually own the country and the politicians. Some guests change their minds and attitudes towards socialism, and some do not. Jurgis begins to spend all his time and much of his money on spreading the Socialist cause, though he does occasionally fall into old habits of drink. At those times, he remembers, however, that it is a \"wicked thing to spend one's pennies for a drink, when the working-class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered. Jurgis attempts to convert his neighbors to socialism, though he makes many enemies and almost gets into a few fights during the process. The people tell Jurgis that socialism is \"paternalism,\" but Jurgis argues that by letting the capitalists rule the country and build the libraries and social structures, they are not allowing the workers to build their own country. Capitalism is true paternalism. Jurgis meets and hears a number of famous socialist speakers and writers. He meets the \"Little Giant,\" a little person who \"had written a veritable encyclopedia\" of Socialism. He hears a young author from California that had made a fortune selling books but that had never ceased to fight for the poor. He begins to read the \"Appeal to Reason,\" a tabloid newspaper that spreads the word of socialism through fantastical stories. Jurgis and the Socialist Party members distribute flyers and pamphlets telling the people of Packingtown what they can do to fight the Beef Trust when their strike fails. Feeling pressure, Mike Scully brings in the South Carolina \"pitchfork Senator\" to speak to the workers and to fight for the Republican Party. Jurgis stands up, however, and gives his own speech in the meeting, telling the crowd how he himself had been a part of the political machine that had bought votes and oppressed the voice of the people","The next morning, Jurgis goes to find Teta Elzbieta. He starts talking to her about socialism. Teta Elzbieta couldn't care less about whether or not socialism is right for the world. All she cares about is that Jurgis's new convictions mean that he plans to stay sober and look for a job. Once she figures that out, she encourages Jurgis's socialism as much as he wants. Jurgis starts looking for jobs at the various hotels in the neighborhood. A week later, Jurgis goes into the lobby of a hotel and approaches the owner. The owner asks Jurgis if he drinks. Jurgis says no, and the owner asks Jurgis if he is afraid of hard work. There's a job available for a night porter, but he'll have to do a lot of cleaning and hauling. Jurgis says that's fine. Jurgis tells Ostrinski he's gotten a job at a nearby hotel. Ostrinski is thrilled to hear that Jurgis has been hired at Hind's Hotel. Apparently, Tommy Hinds, the owner of this place, is a state organizer of the Socialist Party in Illinois. The next day, Jurgis informs his employer that he is also a socialist. Tommy Hinds shakes his hand. Tommy Hinds calls Jurgis \"Comrade Jurgis,\" and Jurgis calls his boss \"Comrade Hinds.\" Tommy Hinds frequently goes out to convince people to vote the socialist ticket to solve their troubles. He has a history as a union organizer and populist. After the 1896 election, in which Populist and Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan lost his campaign for president, Tommy Hinds gave up on the idea of wealth in private hands. Ever since then, he has been getting himself invited to every business meeting and church service in Chicago so that he can preach the value of socialism far and wide. Tommy Hinds's hotel is also a big source of pro-socialist political activity. His staff members are all socialists, and his chief clerk has been fighting the big railroad companies his whole life. His assistant clerk is Harry Adams, a smart guy from Massachusetts who moved down south to South Carolina and was horrified by the widespread illiteracy and poverty he found there. So he moved to Chicago and became a socialist. Oddly, the fact that this hotel is a socialist business doesn't mean it's not profitable. The hotel is inexpensive and gets plenty of out-of-towners looking for work in the stockyards who are too poor to afford lodging elsewhere. Tommy Hinds works to convert all of these new guys to the cause. He frequently asks Jurgis to tell them about his experiences in the stockyards. Jurgis is reluctant at first, but eventually he realizes that Tommy Hinds doesn't need him to get personal - he just wants Jurgis to explain the bad business and hygiene practices at these meatpacking plants. Tommy Hinds explains that it's not just the Beef Trust ; all business in the US is dominated by just a few super-powerful companies. The Standard Oil Company controls the price of oil and the Steel Trust overcharges on nails, and so on. Jurgis learns everything he needs to know about socialism working for Tommy Hinds. Because he has such faith in Tommy Hinds's views, Jurgis works harder and with more loyalty than he ever would have for the meatpackers. Jurgis does his best to convert his acquaintances to socialism. Still, he often finds himself almost getting into fights. Even though the benefits of socialism seem obvious to Jurgis, a lot of working people resist. They claim to prefer individualism, and resist the kind of control on their money that socialism would mean. Jurgis feels that these people are forgetting that the people who really benefit from individualism and capitalism are the steel, oil, and meat magnates. It's never the working guy who profits from free enterprise. Jurgis starts to read newspapers and to learn about America's history so that he can convince people to join the socialist cause. At socialist meetings, Jurgis meets a range of extraordinary organizers and great people who have sacrificed so much to join the cause of the working man. Jurgis becomes a regular reader of Appeal to Reason, a socialist newspaper with lots of tidbits about how the American working man suffers. They begin to distribute this newspaper in Packingtown after the union lost the strike there, so that workers can take hope. Jurgis also hands out Appeal to Reason in the stockyards in an effort to undo the damage he did when he was part of Mike Scully's political machine. The socialists are gaining a real political foothold in Packingtown, and Mike Scully and his political machine are on the run.","With his newfound faith and fire, Jurgis goes to see Elzbieta. She is not interested in his politics but notices the spark of industry in his eyes and tolerates his rhetoric. Soon Jurgis finds a job as a porter at a hotel, a hotel that, coincidentally, is a political hotbed of socialism. The proprietor of the hotel, Tommy Hinds, and his staff educate Jurgis and others in the ways and means of socialism. Gradually, socialism becomes the root of Jurgis' existence.","Jurgis visits Teta Elzbieta to tell her about socialism. She is happy to hear that he wishes to work and help support the family. She even agrees to attend socialist political meetings with him from time to time. Jurgis finds a job as a porter in a small hotel that pays thirty dollars a month plus board. Ostrinski informs Jurgis that his new boss, Tommy Hinds, is actually a state organizer for the socialist party and a well-known socialist speaker. Hinds is overjoyed to find that Jurgis is a comrade. Hinds never tires of preaching socialism in his hotel and elsewhere. Socialists flock to the hotel, so the radical philosophy of the proprietor does not hurt the business he owns. Hinds often urges Jurgis to detail the horrendous filth of the meat-packing plants along with the real recipes for tinned meats and sausages. Jurgis takes up the socialist cause with a passion. He endeavors to read newspapers, including The Appeal to Reason, and learn all about the political and economic systems of power in America. He becomes angry and frustrated when he cannot sway people to socialism"],"next summary id":"chapter 31","next chapter":"Jurgis attempts to persuade Marija to leave prostitution, but she explains that she cannot because she is addicted to morphine.

He had\nsent Maria Gostrey a word early, by hand, to ask if he might come to\nbreakfast; in consequence of which, at noon, she awaited him in the\ncool shade of her little Dutch-looking dining-room. This retreat was at\nthe back of the house, with a view of a scrap of old garden that had\nbeen saved from modern ravage; and though he had on more than one other\noccasion had his legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of\nhospitality, the place had never before struck him as so sacred to\npleasant knowledge, to intimate charm, to antique order, to a neatness\nthat was almost august. To sit there was, as he had told his hostess\nbefore, to see life reflected for the time in ideally kept pewter;\nwhich was somehow becoming, improving to life, so that one's eyes were\nheld and comforted.  Strether's were comforted at all events now--and\nthe more that it was the last time--with the charming effect, on the\nboard bare of a cloth and proud of its perfect surface, of the small\nold crockery and old silver, matched by the more substantial pieces\nhappily disposed about the room.  The specimens of vivid Delf, in\nparticular had the dignity of family portraits; and it was in the midst\nof them that our friend resignedly expressed himself. He spoke even\nwith a certain philosophic humour.  \"There's nothing more to wait for;\nI seem to have done a good day's work.  I've let them have it all\nround.  I've seen Chad, who has been to London and come back.  He tells\nme I'm 'exciting,' and I seem indeed pretty well to have upset every\none.  I've at any rate excited HIM.  He's distinctly restless.\"\n\n\"You've excited ME,\" Miss Gostrey smiled.  \"I'M distinctly restless.\"\n\n\"Oh you were that when I found you.  It seems to me I've rather got you\nout of it.  What's this,\" he asked as he looked about him, \"but a haunt\nof ancient peace?\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart,\" she presently replied, \"I could make you\ntreat it as a haven of rest.\" On which they fronted each other, across\nthe table, as if things unuttered were in the air.\n\nStrether seemed, in his way, when he next spoke, to take some of them\nup.  \"It wouldn't give me--that would be the trouble--what it will, no\ndoubt, still give you.  I'm not,\" he explained, leaning back in his\nchair, but with his eyes on a small ripe round melon--\"in real harmony\nwith what surrounds me.  You ARE.  I take it too hard. You DON'T.  It\nmakes--that's what it comes to in the end--a fool of me.\" Then at a\ntangent, \"What has he been doing in London?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Ah one may go to London,\" Maria laughed.  \"You know I did.\"\n\nYes--he took the reminder.  \"And you brought ME back.\" He brooded there\nopposite to her, but without gloom.  \"Whom has Chad brought? He's full\nof ideas.  And I wrote to Sarah,\" he added, \"the first thing this\nmorning.  So I'm square.  I'm ready for them.\"\n\nShe neglected certain parts of this speech in the interest of others.\n\"Marie said to me the other day that she felt him to have the makings\nof an immense man of business.\"\n\n\"There it is.  He's the son of his father!\"\n\n\"But SUCH a father!\"\n\n\"Ah just the right one from that point of view!  But it isn't his\nfather in him,\" Strether added, \"that troubles me.\"\n\n\"What is it then?\"  He came back to his breakfast; he partook presently\nof the charming melon, which she liberally cut for him; and it was only\nafter this that he met her question.  Then moreover it was but to\nremark that he'd answer her presently.  She waited, she watched, she\nserved him and amused him, and it was perhaps with this last idea that\nshe soon reminded him of his having never even yet named to her the\narticle produced at Woollett.  \"Do you remember our talking of it in\nLondon--that night at the play?\" Before he could say yes, however, she\nhad put it to him for other matters.  Did he remember, did he\nremember--this and that of their first days?  He remembered everything,\nbringing up with humour even things of which she professed no\nrecollection, things she vehemently denied; and falling back above all\non the great interest of their early time, the curiosity felt by both\nof them as to where he would \"come out.\" They had so assumed it was to\nbe in some wonderful place--they had thought of it as so very MUCH out.\nWell, that was doubtless what it had been--since he had come out just\nthere.  He was out, in truth, as far as it was possible to be, and must\nnow rather bethink himself of getting in again. He found on the spot\nthe image of his recent history; he was like one of the figures of the\nold clock at Berne.  THEY came out, on one side, at their hour, jigged\nalong their little course in the public eye, and went in on the other\nside.  He too had jigged his little course--him too a modest retreat\nawaited.  He offered now, should she really like to know, to name the\ngreat product of Woollett.  It would be a great commentary on\neverything.  At this she stopped him off; she not only had no wish to\nknow, but she wouldn't know for the world.  She had done with the\nproducts of Woollett--for all the good she had got from them.  She\ndesired no further news of them, and she mentioned that Madame de\nVionnet herself had, to her knowledge, lived exempt from the\ninformation he was ready to supply.  She had never consented to receive\nit, though she would have taken it, under stress, from Mrs. Pocock. But\nit was a matter about which Mrs. Pocock appeared to have had little to\nsay--never sounding the word--and it didn't signify now.  There was\nnothing clearly for Maria Gostrey that signified now--save one sharp\npoint, that is, to which she came in time. \"I don't know whether it's\nbefore you as a possibility that, left to himself, Mr. Chad may after\nall go back.  I judge that it IS more or less so before you, from what\nyou just now said of him.\"\n\nHer guest had his eyes on her, kindly but attentively, as if foreseeing\nwhat was to follow this.  \"I don't think it will be for the money.\" And\nthen as she seemed uncertain:  \"I mean I don't believe it will be for\nthat he'll give her up.\"\n\n\"Then he WILL give her up?\"\n\nStrether waited a moment, rather slow and deliberate now, drawing out a\nlittle this last soft stage, pleading with her in various suggestive\nand unspoken ways for patience and understanding. \"What were you just\nabout to ask me?\"\n\n\"Is there anything he can do that would make you patch it up?\"\n\n\"With Mrs. Newsome?\"\n\nHer assent, as if she had had a delicacy about sounding the name, was\nonly in her face; but she added with it:  \"Or is there anything he can\ndo that would make HER try it?\"\n\n\"To patch it up with me?\"  His answer came at last in a conclusive\nheadshake.  \"There's nothing any one can do.  It's over.  Over for both\nof us.\"\n\nMaria wondered, seemed a little to doubt.  \"Are you so sure for her?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--sure now.  Too much has happened.  I'm different for her.\"\n\nShe took it in then, drawing a deeper breath.  \"I see.  So that as\nshe's different for YOU--\"\n\n\"Ah but,\" he interrupted, \"she's not.\"  And as Miss Gostrey wondered\nagain:  \"She's the same.  She's more than ever the same. But I do what\nI didn't before--I SEE her.\"\n\nHe spoke gravely and as if responsibly--since he had to pronounce; and\nthe effect of it was slightly solemn, so that she simply exclaimed\n\"Oh!\"  Satisfied and grateful, however, she showed in her own next\nwords an acceptance of his statement.  \"What then do you go home to?\"\n\nHe had pushed his plate a little away, occupied with another side of\nthe matter; taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that\nhe soon found himself on his feet.  He was affected in advance by what\nhe believed might come from her, and he would have liked to forestall\nit and deal with it tenderly;  yet in the presence of it he wished\nstill more to be--though as smoothly as possible--deterrent and\nconclusive.  He put her question by for the moment; he told her more\nabout Chad.  \"It would have been impossible to meet me more than he did\nlast night on the question of the infamy of not sticking to her.\"\n\n\"Is that what you called it for him--'infamy'?\"\n\n\"Oh rather!  I described to him in detail the base creature he'd be,\nand he quite agrees with me about it.\"\n\n\"So that it's really as if you had nailed him?\"\n\n\"Quite really as if--!  I told him I should curse him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she smiled, \"you HAVE done it.\" And then having thought again:\n\"You CAN'T after that propose--!\"  Yet she scanned his face.\n\n\"Propose again to Mrs. Newsome?\"\n\nShe hesitated afresh, but she brought it out.  \"I've never believed,\nyou know, that you did propose.  I always believed it was really\nshe--and, so far as that goes, I can understand it.  What I mean is,\"\nshe explained, \"that with such a spirit--the spirit of curses!--your\nbreach is past mending.  She has only to know what you've done to him\nnever again to raise a finger.\"\n\n\"I've done,\" said Strether, \"what I could--one can't do more. He\nprotests his devotion and his horror.  But I'm not sure I've saved him.\nHe protests too much.  He asks how one can dream of his being tired.\nBut he has all life before him.\"\n\nMaria saw what he meant.  \"He's formed to please.\"\n\n\"And it's our friend who has formed him.\" Strether felt in it the\nstrange irony.\n\n\"So it's scarcely his fault!\"\n\n\"It's at any rate his danger.  I mean,\" said Strether, \"it's hers. But\nshe knows it.\"\n\n\"Yes, she knows it.  And is your idea,\" Miss Gostrey asked, \"that there\nwas some other woman in London?\"\n\n\"Yes.  No.  That is I HAVE no ideas.  I'm afraid of them. I've done\nwith them.\" And he put out his hand to her.  \"Good-bye.\"\n\nIt brought her back to her unanswered question.  \"To what do you go\nhome?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  There will always be something.\"\n\n\"To a great difference,\" she said as she kept his hand.\n\n\"A great difference--no doubt.  Yet I shall see what I can make of it.\"\n\n\"Shall you make anything so good--?\"  But, as if remembering what Mrs.\nNewsome had done, it was as far as she went.\n\nHe had sufficiently understood.  \"So good as this place at this moment?\nSo good as what YOU make of everything you touch?\" He took a moment to\nsay, for, really and truly, what stood about him there in her\noffer--which was as the offer of exquisite service, of lightened care,\nfor the rest of his days--might well have tempted. It built him softly\nround, it roofed him warmly over, it rested, all so firm, on selection.\nAnd what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge.  It was awkward, it\nwas almost stupid, not to seem to prize such things; yet, none the\nless, so far as they made his opportunity they made it only for a\nmoment.  She'd moreover understand--she always understood.\n\nThat indeed might be, but meanwhile she was going on. \"There's nothing,\nyou know, I wouldn't do for you.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--I know.\"\n\n\"There's nothing,\" she repeated, \"in all the world.\"\n\n\"I know.  I know.  But all the same I must go.\" He had got it at last.\n\"To be right.\"\n\n\"To be right?\"\n\nShe had echoed it in vague deprecation, but he felt it already clear\nfor her.  \"That, you see, is my only logic. Not, out of the whole\naffair, to have got anything for myself.\"\n\nShe thought.  \"But with your wonderful impressions you'll have got a\ngreat deal.\"\n\n\"A great deal\"--he agreed.  \"But nothing like YOU.  It's you who would\nmake me wrong!\"\n\nHonest and fine, she couldn't greatly pretend she didn't see it. Still\nshe could pretend just a little.  \"But why should you be so dreadfully\nright?\"\n\n\"That's the way that--if I must go--you yourself would be the first to\nwant me.  And I can't do anything else.\"\n\nSo then she had to take it, though still with her defeated protest. \"It\nisn't so much your BEING 'right'--it's your horrible sharp eye for what\nmakes you so.\"\n\n\"Oh but you're just as bad yourself.  You can't resist me when I point\nthat out.\"\n\nShe sighed it at last all comically, all tragically, away. \"I can't\nindeed resist you.\"\n\n\"Then there we are!\" said Strether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2074.0,"summary_name":"Book 12, Chapter 5","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201219182819\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/the-ambassadors\/summary\/book-12-chapter-5","summary_text":"Two days later, Strether visits Maria Gostrey one more time for his \"last separation\" .

Come on, don't act like you're that surprised. Plus, it's not like the two of them are just enjoying a day in the country. Strether can tell from the shock in Madame de Vionnet's eyes that he has caught these two doing something that doesn't quite fit into his moral code. And so at this moment, all of reality seems to come crashing down on Strether. He realizes that Chad and Madame have left Paris so they can find a nice quiet inn outside the city and, ahem, engage in a sexual relationship. Of course, Strether tries to act cool about it once he sees that Madame de Vionnet has recognized him. He waves from the shore and invites them to dinner. You know, because to walk away would be awkward. Once Chad and Madame get to shore, all of them are like, \"Wow, what a coincidence! It's great to see you.\" While they're all thinking, \"God, Strether totally knows about what's been going on this whole time.\" This is followed by a super awkward dinner, where Chad and Madame can only think about how ol' third-wheel Strether is blowing their chance at sex. While Strether is thinking that his whole life has been a lie since getting to Paris. He's not the cool guy he thought he was. Instead, he's the one gullible loser in Paris who was too naive to see what was happening right in front of his eyes. Things are about to get real. When Strether leaves them and goes home, he realizes that all along, he's been allowing himself to enjoy Paris because he has enjoyed being among young women and men while still thinking to himself that he wasn't doing anything morally wrong. Which was a nice illusion, while it lasted. But now his image of a perfect Chad and perfect Madame de Vionnet has been shattered, and he doesn't know what to believe anymore. Worse yet, Chad and Madame's sexual relationship means that on some level, Sarah Pocock was right all along. Strether was just too blind to see it. Or worse still, he's actually known all along, but has been lying to himself. Will the cycle never end!","Okay, no more delays. Strether is going to find a way to get in touch with Chad. Dude needs to start answering his texts. Um, we mean telegrams. So this time when he visits Chad's apartment, Chad's actually there. Strether looks up and sees him smoking a cigarette and leaning over the balcony railing, just like the artist Bilham did when Strether first came to Paris. The memory makes Strether nostalgic about the days before he knew about Chad and Madame de Vionnet. The two of them are silent for a long time, during which we're regaled with some of Henry James' classic fill-four-pages-with-a-list-of-objects-in-a-room style of writing. Finally, Strether pipes up and tells Chad that he'll be a monster if he ever leaves Madame de Vionnet. It looks like this is that one last favor Strether told Madame he would do for her. Chad says that he would probably never do this, but probably ain't good enough for Strether. Strether says that he wants this to be the last thing he says to Chad during their time in Paris. So he repeats himself: do not leave Madame...EVER. Chad asks what all of this \"last thing I say\" stuff is all about, and Strether tells him that he's leaving Paris. Chad tells Strether that he's been away in England all week because sometimes a guy just feels like he needs to get away. Again, this is something Strether can sympathize with. Chad tells Strether that everything will be fine between him and Madame. But Strether wants more than just an off-the-cuff \"It'll probably work out.\" He wants Chad to swear on his life that he won't go back to Woollett and give his family the satisfaction of thinking they've won. Strether has suddenly turned into a pretty cold customer. Chad starts to fidget and admits that he's still attracted to all the money he could have by going back to Woollett. Strether tells him to damn the money and be a man. Way to go, Streth!","Strether sees a boat coming around the bend in the river, and he is surprised to discover that the two occupants are Madame de Vionnet and Chad. He is horrified to realize that \"they would show nothing if they could feel sure he hadn't made them out.\" Deciding that there is only one course of action open to him, Strether calls out with \"surprise and joy,\" and they respond by turning the boat to shore. They have dinner together and return to Paris on the same train. The couple's discomfiture forces Strether to the truth that Madame de Vionnet is Chad's mistress: \"Her shawl and Chad's overcoat and her other garments, and his, those they had each worn the day before, were at the place, best known to themselves -- a quiet retreat enough, no doubt -- at which they had been spending the twenty-four hours.\" Strether is disillusioned as much with Chad as he is to learn of the affair; Chad, he acknowledges, \"habitually left things to others, as Strether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration of his famous knowing how to live.\" In the quiet of his room, Strether thinks of his next visit with Maria Gostrey with some apprehension. He almost feels embarrassed by his blindness. Thinking how he would respond to Maria's inevitable question , Strether \"recognized at last that he had really been trying all along to suppose nothing.\"","Concerned by Chad's unlikely disappearance, Strether goes to the young man's apartment to see if he has returned. Chad is there, having in fact just returned from a trip to London, and he greets Strether warmly. As they talk, it occurs to Strether that he could stay in Paris with Chad indefinitely. This raises a moment of regret in Strether's mind, but he finally tells Chad he has come to bid him goodbye. He also has one more thing to say: \"You'll be a brute, you know -- you'll be guilty of the last infamy -- if you ever forsake her.\" Chad protests the idea and says he doesn't know what should make Strether feel he is tired of Madame de Vionnet. \"Strether didn't quite know, either, and such impressions, for the imaginative mind, were always too fine, too floating, to produce on the spot their warrant.\" He reminds Chad of all Madame de Vionnet has done for him and says, \"I remember you, you know, as you were.\" As he walks Strether back to his hotel, Chad suddenly announces a revived interest in the art of advertising, and Strether wonders if he will give up Madame de Vionnet after all. Chad denies the possibility, but Strether's parting remark to Chad is \"You're restless.\""],"next summary id":"book 12, chapter 5","next chapter":"Two days later, Strether visits Maria Gostrey one more time for his \"last separation\" .

He's distinctly restless.\"\n\n\"You've excited ME,\" Miss Gostrey smiled.  \"I'M distinctly restless.\"\n\n\"Oh you were that when I found you.  It seems to me I've rather got you\nout of it.  What's this,\" he asked as he looked about him, \"but a haunt\nof ancient peace?\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart,\" she presently replied, \"I could make you\ntreat it as a haven of rest.\" On which they fronted each other, across\nthe table, as if things unuttered were in the air.\n\nStrether seemed, in his way, when he next spoke, to take some of them\nup.  \"It wouldn't give me--that would be the trouble--what it will, no\ndoubt, still give you.  I'm not,\" he explained, leaning back in his\nchair, but with his eyes on a small ripe round melon--\"in real harmony\nwith what surrounds me.  You ARE.  I take it too hard. You DON'T.  It\nmakes--that's what it comes to in the end--a fool of me.\" Then at a\ntangent, \"What has he been doing in London?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Ah one may go to London,\" Maria laughed.  \"You know I did.\"\n\nYes--he took the reminder.  \"And you brought ME back.\" He brooded there\nopposite to her, but without gloom.  \"Whom has Chad brought? He's full\nof ideas.  And I wrote to Sarah,\" he added, \"the first thing this\nmorning.  So I'm square.  I'm ready for them.\"\n\nShe neglected certain parts of this speech in the interest of others.\n\"Marie said to me the other day that she felt him to have the makings\nof an immense man of business.\"\n\n\"There it is.  He's the son of his father!\"\n\n\"But SUCH a father!\"\n\n\"Ah just the right one from that point of view!  But it isn't his\nfather in him,\" Strether added, \"that troubles me.\"\n\n\"What is it then?\"  He came back to his breakfast; he partook presently\nof the charming melon, which she liberally cut for him; and it was only\nafter this that he met her question.  Then moreover it was but to\nremark that he'd answer her presently.  She waited, she watched, she\nserved him and amused him, and it was perhaps with this last idea that\nshe soon reminded him of his having never even yet named to her the\narticle produced at Woollett.  \"Do you remember our talking of it in\nLondon--that night at the play?\" Before he could say yes, however, she\nhad put it to him for other matters.  Did he remember, did he\nremember--this and that of their first days?  He remembered everything,\nbringing up with humour even things of which she professed no\nrecollection, things she vehemently denied; and falling back above all\non the great interest of their early time, the curiosity felt by both\nof them as to where he would \"come out.\" They had so assumed it was to\nbe in some wonderful place--they had thought of it as so very MUCH out.\nWell, that was doubtless what it had been--since he had come out just\nthere.  He was out, in truth, as far as it was possible to be, and must\nnow rather bethink himself of getting in again. He found on the spot\nthe image of his recent history; he was like one of the figures of the\nold clock at Berne.  THEY came out, on one side, at their hour, jigged\nalong their little course in the public eye, and went in on the other\nside.  He too had jigged his little course--him too a modest retreat\nawaited.  He offered now, should she really like to know, to name the\ngreat product of Woollett.  It would be a great commentary on\neverything.  At this she stopped him off; she not only had no wish to\nknow, but she wouldn't know for the world.  She had done with the\nproducts of Woollett--for all the good she had got from them.  She\ndesired no further news of them, and she mentioned that Madame de\nVionnet herself had, to her knowledge, lived exempt from the\ninformation he was ready to supply.  She had never consented to receive\nit, though she would have taken it, under stress, from Mrs. Pocock. But\nit was a matter about which Mrs. Pocock appeared to have had little to\nsay--never sounding the word--and it didn't signify now.  There was\nnothing clearly for Maria Gostrey that signified now--save one sharp\npoint, that is, to which she came in time. \"I don't know whether it's\nbefore you as a possibility that, left to himself, Mr. Chad may after\nall go back.  I judge that it IS more or less so before you, from what\nyou just now said of him.\"\n\nHer guest had his eyes on her, kindly but attentively, as if foreseeing\nwhat was to follow this.  \"I don't think it will be for the money.\" And\nthen as she seemed uncertain:  \"I mean I don't believe it will be for\nthat he'll give her up.\"\n\n\"Then he WILL give her up?\"\n\nStrether waited a moment, rather slow and deliberate now, drawing out a\nlittle this last soft stage, pleading with her in various suggestive\nand unspoken ways for patience and understanding. \"What were you just\nabout to ask me?\"\n\n\"Is there anything he can do that would make you patch it up?\"\n\n\"With Mrs. Newsome?\"\n\nHer assent, as if she had had a delicacy about sounding the name, was\nonly in her face; but she added with it:  \"Or is there anything he can\ndo that would make HER try it?\"\n\n\"To patch it up with me?\"  His answer came at last in a conclusive\nheadshake.  \"There's nothing any one can do.  It's over.  Over for both\nof us.\"\n\nMaria wondered, seemed a little to doubt.  \"Are you so sure for her?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--sure now.  Too much has happened.  I'm different for her.\"\n\nShe took it in then, drawing a deeper breath.  \"I see.  So that as\nshe's different for YOU--\"\n\n\"Ah but,\" he interrupted, \"she's not.\"  And as Miss Gostrey wondered\nagain:  \"She's the same.  She's more than ever the same. But I do what\nI didn't before--I SEE her.\"\n\nHe spoke gravely and as if responsibly--since he had to pronounce; and\nthe effect of it was slightly solemn, so that she simply exclaimed\n\"Oh!\"  Satisfied and grateful, however, she showed in her own next\nwords an acceptance of his statement.  \"What then do you go home to?\"\n\nHe had pushed his plate a little away, occupied with another side of\nthe matter; taking refuge verily in that side and feeling so moved that\nhe soon found himself on his feet.  He was affected in advance by what\nhe believed might come from her, and he would have liked to forestall\nit and deal with it tenderly;  yet in the presence of it he wished\nstill more to be--though as smoothly as possible--deterrent and\nconclusive.  He put her question by for the moment; he told her more\nabout Chad.  \"It would have been impossible to meet me more than he did\nlast night on the question of the infamy of not sticking to her.\"\n\n\"Is that what you called it for him--'infamy'?\"\n\n\"Oh rather!  I described to him in detail the base creature he'd be,\nand he quite agrees with me about it.\"\n\n\"So that it's really as if you had nailed him?\"\n\n\"Quite really as if--!  I told him I should curse him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she smiled, \"you HAVE done it.\" And then having thought again:\n\"You CAN'T after that propose--!\"  Yet she scanned his face.\n\n\"Propose again to Mrs. Newsome?\"\n\nShe hesitated afresh, but she brought it out.  \"I've never believed,\nyou know, that you did propose.  I always believed it was really\nshe--and, so far as that goes, I can understand it.  What I mean is,\"\nshe explained, \"that with such a spirit--the spirit of curses!--your\nbreach is past mending.  She has only to know what you've done to him\nnever again to raise a finger.\"\n\n\"I've done,\" said Strether, \"what I could--one can't do more. He\nprotests his devotion and his horror.  But I'm not sure I've saved him.\nHe protests too much.  He asks how one can dream of his being tired.\nBut he has all life before him.\"\n\nMaria saw what he meant.  \"He's formed to please.\"\n\n\"And it's our friend who has formed him.\" Strether felt in it the\nstrange irony.\n\n\"So it's scarcely his fault!\"\n\n\"It's at any rate his danger.  I mean,\" said Strether, \"it's hers. But\nshe knows it.\"\n\n\"Yes, she knows it.  And is your idea,\" Miss Gostrey asked, \"that there\nwas some other woman in London?\"\n\n\"Yes.  No.  That is I HAVE no ideas.  I'm afraid of them. I've done\nwith them.\" And he put out his hand to her.  \"Good-bye.\"\n\nIt brought her back to her unanswered question.  \"To what do you go\nhome?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  There will always be something.\"\n\n\"To a great difference,\" she said as she kept his hand.\n\n\"A great difference--no doubt.  Yet I shall see what I can make of it.\"\n\n\"Shall you make anything so good--?\"  But, as if remembering what Mrs.\nNewsome had done, it was as far as she went.\n\nHe had sufficiently understood.  \"So good as this place at this moment?\nSo good as what YOU make of everything you touch?\" He took a moment to\nsay, for, really and truly, what stood about him there in her\noffer--which was as the offer of exquisite service, of lightened care,\nfor the rest of his days--might well have tempted. It built him softly\nround, it roofed him warmly over, it rested, all so firm, on selection.\nAnd what ruled selection was beauty and knowledge.  It was awkward, it\nwas almost stupid, not to seem to prize such things; yet, none the\nless, so far as they made his opportunity they made it only for a\nmoment.  She'd moreover understand--she always understood.\n\nThat indeed might be, but meanwhile she was going on. \"There's nothing,\nyou know, I wouldn't do for you.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--I know.\"\n\n\"There's nothing,\" she repeated, \"in all the world.\"\n\n\"I know.  I know.  But all the same I must go.\" He had got it at last.\n\"To be right.\"\n\n\"To be right?\"\n\nShe had echoed it in vague deprecation, but he felt it already clear\nfor her.  \"That, you see, is my only logic. Not, out of the whole\naffair, to have got anything for myself.\"\n\nShe thought.  \"But with your wonderful impressions you'll have got a\ngreat deal.\"\n\n\"A great deal\"--he agreed.  \"But nothing like YOU.  It's you who would\nmake me wrong!\"\n\nHonest and fine, she couldn't greatly pretend she didn't see it. Still\nshe could pretend just a little.  \"But why should you be so dreadfully\nright?\"\n\n\"That's the way that--if I must go--you yourself would be the first to\nwant me.  And I can't do anything else.\"\n\nSo then she had to take it, though still with her defeated protest. \"It\nisn't so much your BEING 'right'--it's your horrible sharp eye for what\nmakes you so.\"\n\n\"Oh but you're just as bad yourself.  You can't resist me when I point\nthat out.\"\n\nShe sighed it at last all comically, all tragically, away. \"I can't\nindeed resist you.\"\n\n\"Then there we are!\" said Strether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2074.0,"summary_name":"Chapter V","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201028052337\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/a\/the-ambassadors\/summary-and-analysis\/book-12-chapter-v","summary_text":"Strether has one more separation to face and sends a word to Maria to ask if he might come for breakfast.

Come on, don't act like you're that surprised. Plus, it's not like the two of them are just enjoying a day in the country. Strether can tell from the shock in Madame de Vionnet's eyes that he has caught these two doing something that doesn't quite fit into his moral code. And so at this moment, all of reality seems to come crashing down on Strether. He realizes that Chad and Madame have left Paris so they can find a nice quiet inn outside the city and, ahem, engage in a sexual relationship. Of course, Strether tries to act cool about it once he sees that Madame de Vionnet has recognized him. He waves from the shore and invites them to dinner. You know, because to walk away would be awkward. Once Chad and Madame get to shore, all of them are like, \"Wow, what a coincidence! It's great to see you.\" While they're all thinking, \"God, Strether totally knows about what's been going on this whole time.\" This is followed by a super awkward dinner, where Chad and Madame can only think about how ol' third-wheel Strether is blowing their chance at sex. While Strether is thinking that his whole life has been a lie since getting to Paris. He's not the cool guy he thought he was. Instead, he's the one gullible loser in Paris who was too naive to see what was happening right in front of his eyes. Things are about to get real. When Strether leaves them and goes home, he realizes that all along, he's been allowing himself to enjoy Paris because he has enjoyed being among young women and men while still thinking to himself that he wasn't doing anything morally wrong. Which was a nice illusion, while it lasted. But now his image of a perfect Chad and perfect Madame de Vionnet has been shattered, and he doesn't know what to believe anymore. Worse yet, Chad and Madame's sexual relationship means that on some level, Sarah Pocock was right all along. Strether was just too blind to see it. Or worse still, he's actually known all along, but has been lying to himself. Will the cycle never end!","Okay, no more delays. Strether is going to find a way to get in touch with Chad. Dude needs to start answering his texts. Um, we mean telegrams. So this time when he visits Chad's apartment, Chad's actually there. Strether looks up and sees him smoking a cigarette and leaning over the balcony railing, just like the artist Bilham did when Strether first came to Paris. The memory makes Strether nostalgic about the days before he knew about Chad and Madame de Vionnet. The two of them are silent for a long time, during which we're regaled with some of Henry James' classic fill-four-pages-with-a-list-of-objects-in-a-room style of writing. Finally, Strether pipes up and tells Chad that he'll be a monster if he ever leaves Madame de Vionnet. It looks like this is that one last favor Strether told Madame he would do for her. Chad says that he would probably never do this, but probably ain't good enough for Strether. Strether says that he wants this to be the last thing he says to Chad during their time in Paris. So he repeats himself: do not leave Madame...EVER. Chad asks what all of this \"last thing I say\" stuff is all about, and Strether tells him that he's leaving Paris. Chad tells Strether that he's been away in England all week because sometimes a guy just feels like he needs to get away. Again, this is something Strether can sympathize with. Chad tells Strether that everything will be fine between him and Madame. But Strether wants more than just an off-the-cuff \"It'll probably work out.\" He wants Chad to swear on his life that he won't go back to Woollett and give his family the satisfaction of thinking they've won. Strether has suddenly turned into a pretty cold customer. Chad starts to fidget and admits that he's still attracted to all the money he could have by going back to Woollett. Strether tells him to damn the money and be a man. Way to go, Streth!","Strether sees a boat coming around the bend in the river, and he is surprised to discover that the two occupants are Madame de Vionnet and Chad. He is horrified to realize that \"they would show nothing if they could feel sure he hadn't made them out.\" Deciding that there is only one course of action open to him, Strether calls out with \"surprise and joy,\" and they respond by turning the boat to shore. They have dinner together and return to Paris on the same train. The couple's discomfiture forces Strether to the truth that Madame de Vionnet is Chad's mistress: \"Her shawl and Chad's overcoat and her other garments, and his, those they had each worn the day before, were at the place, best known to themselves -- a quiet retreat enough, no doubt -- at which they had been spending the twenty-four hours.\" Strether is disillusioned as much with Chad as he is to learn of the affair; Chad, he acknowledges, \"habitually left things to others, as Strether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration of his famous knowing how to live.\" In the quiet of his room, Strether thinks of his next visit with Maria Gostrey with some apprehension. He almost feels embarrassed by his blindness. Thinking how he would respond to Maria's inevitable question , Strether \"recognized at last that he had really been trying all along to suppose nothing.\"","Concerned by Chad's unlikely disappearance, Strether goes to the young man's apartment to see if he has returned. Chad is there, having in fact just returned from a trip to London, and he greets Strether warmly. As they talk, it occurs to Strether that he could stay in Paris with Chad indefinitely. This raises a moment of regret in Strether's mind, but he finally tells Chad he has come to bid him goodbye. He also has one more thing to say: \"You'll be a brute, you know -- you'll be guilty of the last infamy -- if you ever forsake her.\" Chad protests the idea and says he doesn't know what should make Strether feel he is tired of Madame de Vionnet. \"Strether didn't quite know, either, and such impressions, for the imaginative mind, were always too fine, too floating, to produce on the spot their warrant.\" He reminds Chad of all Madame de Vionnet has done for him and says, \"I remember you, you know, as you were.\" As he walks Strether back to his hotel, Chad suddenly announces a revived interest in the art of advertising, and Strether wonders if he will give up Madame de Vionnet after all. Chad denies the possibility, but Strether's parting remark to Chad is \"You're restless.\""],"next summary id":"chapter v","next chapter":"Strether has one more separation to face and sends a word to Maria to ask if he might come for breakfast.

He thinks about his son Dallas and his daughter Mary. Mary married one of Reggie Chivers1s dullest sons. Dallas became an architect and Newland became a politician, briefly. Newland realizes that he has become a \\\"good citizen\\\" although he has missed the \\\"flower of life. Newland respected the duty of marriage and mourned when May died. Dallas calls his father on the telephone and tells him that he is going to Paris on business; Newland must accompany him. Newland reflects that so much had changed in his world. Dallas, his eldest son, was in fact marrying on e of :Beaufort1s bastards\\\", Fanny Beaufort, and no one cared. Newland goes to Paris with his son; there, Dallas informs him that Ellen is expecting them in the evening. Dallas says that Newland should definitely go see her because Ellen was once \\\"Newland1s Fanny\\\", the \\\"woman Newland would have chucked everything for, but didn1t. Dallas reveals that May said, on her death bed, that she asked Newland to give up the thing he wanted most, and he did. Newland says simply, \\\"She didn1t ask. Dallas then remarks that May and Newland never told each other anything; they lived in a silent \\\"deaf and dumb asylum. When Newland and Dallas arrive in Ellen1s neighborhood; Newland decided that he doesn1t want to go up and see her. When Dallas asks him what she should say on his behalf, he says, say that I1m \\\"Old-fashioned. Dallas goes to see Ellen and Newland sits on the bench outside her building for a long time; when a servant comes to shut her shutters, Newland decides to leave the neighborhood.\", \"analysis\": \"This chapter is written to show, quite ironically, that all the prohibitions that \\\"bent and bound\\\" Newland no longer exist a generation later. His son Dallas is able to live the life that Newland would have lived if he had not had Society choosing the women he mustt marry, the profession he would have, the way he would speak. Dallas makes fun of Newland for living such a life without passion, living in a \\\"deaf and dumb asylum\\\" for so many years. Newland even recognizes that the death of May has liberated him to finally be with his true love, Ellen, but habit has made him a coward and trapped in the same day-to-day life. What is so sad about the ending is that earlier in the novel there was always someone to blame for why Newland and Ellen could not be together. First, Ellen was still married; then the wedding was moved forward; then May was pregnant. But now, at the end, there is nothing stopping Newland from meeting Ellen. But Newland has become so inculcated by his old society values that he can1t even act when there are no prohibitions. Now, the theme of the book becomes tricky. Prior to this chapter, one could make an easy case that Society prevented people from realizing their dreams. But now we see, that it is Newland1s own cowardice that prevents him from being happy. Society becomes just an excuse for why people don1t seek out their dreams. Beaufort is an example of a man from his own generation who found happiness despite the regulations, his own financial destruction and the disdain of society. Wharton1s point seems to be that people should not blame their society for their inability to act the rules and norms of society change rapidly, so it is only one1s personal standards that can be constant and abided by\"}","chapter":"\nNewland Archer sat at the writing-table in his library in East\nThirty-ninth Street.\n\nHe had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration\nof the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, and the spectacle of\nthose great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages, where the\nthrong of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically\ncatalogued treasures, had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory.\n\n\"Why, this used to be one of the old Cesnola rooms,\" he heard some one\nsay; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting\nalone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight figure\nin a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely-fitted vista of\nthe old Museum.\n\nThe vision had roused a host of other associations, and he sat looking\nwith new eyes at the library which, for over thirty years, had been the\nscene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations.\n\nIt was the room in which most of the real things of his life had\nhappened.  There his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to\nhim, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young\nwomen of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a\nchild; and there their eldest boy, Dallas, too delicate to be taken to\nchurch in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the Bishop\nof New York, the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop, so long the\npride and ornament of his diocese.  There Dallas had first staggered\nacross the floor shouting \"Dad,\" while May and the nurse laughed behind\nthe door; there their second child, Mary (who was so like her mother),\nhad announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of Reggie\nChivers's many sons; and there Archer had kissed her through her\nwedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them\nto Grace Church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its\nfoundations the \"Grace Church wedding\" remained an unchanged\ninstitution.\n\nIt was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future\nof the children: the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill,\nMary's incurable indifference to \"accomplishments,\" and passion for\nsport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward \"art\" which had\nfinally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a\nrising New York architect.\n\nThe young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and\nbusiness and taking up all sorts of new things.  If they were not\nabsorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that\nthey were going in for Central American archaeology, for architecture\nor landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the\nprerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting\nGeorgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word\n\"Colonial.\"  Nobody nowadays had \"Colonial\" houses except the\nmillionaire grocers of the suburbs.\n\nBut above all--sometimes Archer put it above all--it was in that\nlibrary that the Governor of New York, coming down from Albany one\nevening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said,\nbanging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses:\n\"Hang the professional politician!  You're the kind of man the country\nwants, Archer.  If the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you\nhave got to lend a hand in the cleaning.\"\n\n\"Men like you--\" how Archer had glowed at the phrase!  How eagerly he\nhad risen up at the call!  It was an echo of Ned Winsett's old appeal\nto roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man\nwho set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was\nirresistible.\n\nArcher, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself WERE what\nhis country needed, at least in the active service to which Theodore\nRoosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not,\nfor after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re-elected, and\nhad dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and\nfrom that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the\nreforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its\napathy.  It was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered\nto what the young men of his generation and his set had looked\nforward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which\ntheir vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new\nstate of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built\nwall.  He had done little in public life; he would always be by nature\na contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to\ncontemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man's friendship\nto be his strength and pride.\n\nHe had been, in short, what people were beginning to call \"a good\ncitizen.\"  In New York, for many years past, every new movement,\nphilanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion\nand wanted his name.  People said:  \"Ask Archer\" when there was a\nquestion of starting the first school for crippled children,\nreorganising the Museum of Art, founding the Grolier Club, inaugurating\nthe new Library, or getting up a new society of chamber music.  His\ndays were full, and they were filled decently.  He supposed it was all\na man ought to ask.\n\nSomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life.  But he thought of\nit now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined\nwould have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first\nprize in a lottery.  There were a hundred million tickets in HIS\nlottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too\ndecidedly against him.  When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was\nabstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a\nbook or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he\nhad missed.  That vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him\nfrom thinking of other women.  He had been what was called a faithful\nhusband; and when May had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious\npneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had\nhonestly mourned her.  Their long years together had shown him that it\ndid not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept\nthe dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of\nugly appetites.  Looking about him, he honoured his own past, and\nmourned for it.  After all, there was good in the old ways.\n\nHis eyes, making the round of the room--done over by Dallas with\nEnglish mezzotints, Chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white\nand pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old Eastlake\nwriting-table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his\nfirst photograph of May, which still kept its place beside his inkstand.\n\nThere she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin\nand flapping Leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the\nMission garden.  And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;\nnever quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous,\nfaithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of\ngrowth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt\nitself without her ever being conscious of the change.  This hard\nbright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered.\nHer incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their\nviews from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first,\na joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in\nwhich father and children had unconsciously collaborated.  And she had\ndied thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious\nhouseholds like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was\nconvinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate\nin Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his\nparents' lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her)\nwould transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.  And of Mary she was\nsure as of her own self.  So, having snatched little Bill from the\ngrave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her\nplace in the Archer vault in St.  Mark's, where Mrs. Archer already lay\nsafe from the terrifying \"trend\" which her daughter-in-law had never\neven become aware of.\n\nOpposite May's portrait stood one of her daughter.  Mary Chivers was as\ntall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and\nslightly slouching, as the altered fashion required.  Mary Chivers's\nmighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the\ntwenty-inch waist that May Archer's azure sash so easily spanned.  And\nthe difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely\ngirt as her figure.  Mary, who was no less conventional, and no more\nintelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.  There\nwas good in the new order too.\n\nThe telephone clicked, and Archer, turning from the photographs,\nunhooked the transmitter at his elbow.  How far they were from the days\nwhen the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been New York's\nonly means of quick communication!\n\n\"Chicago wants you.\"\n\nAh--it must be a long-distance from Dallas, who had been sent to\nChicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the Lakeside palace they\nwere to build for a young millionaire with ideas.  The firm always sent\nDallas on such errands.\n\n\"Hallo, Dad--Yes: Dallas.  I say--how do you feel about sailing on\nWednesday?  Mauretania: Yes, next Wednesday as ever is.  Our client\nwants me to look at some Italian gardens before we settle anything, and\nhas asked me to nip over on the next boat.  I've got to be back on the\nfirst of June--\" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--\"so we\nmust look alive.  I say, Dad, I want your help: do come.\"\n\nDallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and\nnatural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the\nfire.  The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer, for\nlong-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as\nelectric lighting and five-day Atlantic voyages.  But the laugh did\nstartle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and\nmiles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and\nbusy indifferent millions--Dallas's laugh should be able to say: \"Of\ncourse, whatever happens, I must get back on the first, because Fanny\nBeaufort and I are to be married on the fifth.\"\n\nThe voice began again:  \"Think it over?  No, sir: not a minute.  You've\ngot to say yes now.  Why not, I'd like to know?  If you can allege a\nsingle reason--No; I knew it.  Then it's a go, eh?  Because I count on\nyou to ring up the Cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you'd better\nbook a return on a boat from Marseilles.  I say, Dad; it'll be our last\ntime together, in this kind of way--.  Oh, good!  I knew you would.\"\n\nChicago rang off, and Archer rose and began to pace up and down the\nroom.\n\nIt would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was\nright.  They would have lots of other \"times\" after Dallas's marriage,\nhis father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and Fanny\nBeaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to\ninterfere with their intimacy.  On the contrary, from what he had seen\nof her, he thought she would be naturally included in it.  Still,\nchange was change, and differences were differences, and much as he\nfelt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting\nto seize this last chance of being alone with his boy.\n\nThere was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one\nthat he had lost the habit of travel.  May had disliked to move except\nfor valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the\nmountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in\nThirty-ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands' in\nNewport.  After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty\nto travel for six months; and the whole family had made the\nold-fashioned tour through England, Switzerland and Italy.  Their time\nbeing limited (no one knew why) they had omitted France.  Archer\nremembered Dallas's wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc\ninstead of Rheims and Chartres.  But Mary and Bill wanted\nmountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in Dallas's wake\nthrough the English cathedrals; and May, always fair to her children,\nhad insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and\nartistic proclivities.  She had indeed proposed that her husband should\ngo to Paris for a fortnight, and join them on the Italian lakes after\nthey had \"done\" Switzerland; but Archer had declined.  \"We'll stick\ntogether,\" he said; and May's face had brightened at his setting such a\ngood example to Dallas.\n\nSince her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for\nhis continuing in the same routine.  His children had urged him to\ntravel: Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad\nand \"see the galleries.\"  The very mysteriousness of such a cure made\nher the more confident of its efficacy.  But Archer had found himself\nheld fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from\nnew things.\n\nNow, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk.\nThe worst of doing one's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for\ndoing anything else.  At least that was the view that the men of his\ngeneration had taken.  The trenchant divisions between right and wrong,\nhonest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little\nscope for the unforeseen.  There are moments when a man's imagination,\nso easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily\nlevel, and surveys the long windings of destiny.  Archer hung there and\nwondered....\n\nWhat was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose\nstandards had bent and bound him?  He remembered a sneering prophecy of\npoor Lawrence Lefferts's, uttered years ago in that very room:  \"If\nthings go on at this rate, our children will be marrying Beaufort's\nbastards.\"\n\nIt was just what Archer's eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing;\nand nobody wondered or reproved.  Even the boy's Aunt Janey, who still\nlooked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her\nmother's emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and\ncarried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and\nFanny Beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a\n\"set\" from a Paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned\nbeauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an\nIsabey miniature.\n\nFanny Beaufort, who had appeared in New York at eighteen, after the\ndeath of her parents, had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won\nit thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid\nof her, society took her joyfully for granted.  She was pretty, amusing\nand accomplished: what more did any one want?  Nobody was narrow-minded\nenough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father's\npast and her own origin.  Only the older people remembered so obscure\nan incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort's failure, or\nthe fact that after his wife's death he had been quietly married to the\nnotorious Fanny Ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a\nlittle girl who inherited her beauty.  He was subsequently heard of in\nConstantinople, then in Russia; and a dozen years later American\ntravellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres, where he\nrepresented a large insurance agency.  He and his wife died there in\nthe odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had\nappeared in New York in charge of May Archer's sister-in-law, Mrs. Jack\nWelland, whose husband had been appointed the girl's guardian.  The\nfact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer's\nchildren, and nobody was surprised when Dallas's engagement was\nannounced.\n\nNothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the\nworld had travelled.  People nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms\nand \"movements,\" with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much\nabout their neighbours.  And of what account was anybody's past, in the\nhuge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same\nplane?\n\nNewland Archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety\nof the Paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and\neagerness of youth.\n\nIt was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening\nwaistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot\ntemples.  He wondered if it was thus that his son's conducted itself in\nthe presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort--and decided that it was not.  \"It\nfunctions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different,\" he\nreflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had\nannounced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would\napprove.\n\n\"The difference is that these young people take it for granted that\nthey're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took\nit for granted that we shouldn't.  Only, I wonder--the thing one's so\ncertain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?\"\n\nIt was the day after their arrival in Paris, and the spring sunshine\nheld Archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the\nPlace Vendome.  One of the things he had stipulated--almost the only\none--when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas, was that, in Paris,\nhe shouldn't be made to go to one of the newfangled \"palaces.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right--of course,\" Dallas good-naturedly agreed.  \"I'll take\nyou to some jolly old-fashioned place--the Bristol say--\" leaving his\nfather speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and\nemperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for\nits quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour.\n\nArcher had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the\nscene of his return to Paris; then the personal vision had faded, and\nhe had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska's\nlife.  Sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had\ngone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the\navenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public\ngardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll\nof the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and\npleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting.  Now the spectacle\nwas before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy,\nold-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the\nruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being....\n\nDallas's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder.  \"Hullo, father: this\nis something like, isn't it?\"  They stood for a while looking out in\nsilence, and then the young man continued:  \"By the way, I've got a\nmessage for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half-past\nfive.\"\n\nHe said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual\nitem of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave\nfor Florence the next evening.  Archer looked at him, and thought he\nsaw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother Mingott's\nmalice.\n\n\"Oh, didn't I tell you?\" Dallas pursued.  \"Fanny made me swear to do\nthree things while I was in Paris: get her the score of the last\nDebussy songs, go to the Grand-Guignol and see Madame Olenska.  You\nknow she was awfully good to Fanny when Mr. Beaufort sent her over from\nBuenos Ayres to the Assomption.  Fanny hadn't any friends in Paris, and\nMadame Olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays.\nI believe she was a great friend of the first Mrs. Beaufort's.  And\nshe's our cousin, of course.  So I rang her up this morning, before I\nwent out, and told her you and I were here for two days and wanted to\nsee her.\"\n\nArcher continued to stare at him.  \"You told her I was here?\"\n\n\"Of course--why not?\"  Dallas's eye brows went up whimsically.  Then,\ngetting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father's with a\nconfidential pressure.\n\n\"I say, father: what was she like?\"\n\nArcher felt his colour rise under his son's unabashed gaze.  \"Come, own\nup: you and she were great pals, weren't you?  Wasn't she most awfully\nlovely?\"\n\n\"Lovely?  I don't know.  She was different.\"\n\n\"Ah--there you have it!  That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?\nWhen she comes, SHE'S DIFFERENT--and one doesn't know why.  It's\nexactly what I feel about Fanny.\"\n\nHis father drew back a step, releasing his arm.  \"About Fanny?  But, my\ndear fellow--I should hope so!  Only I don't see--\"\n\n\"Dash it, Dad, don't be prehistoric!  Wasn't she--once--your Fanny?\"\n\nDallas belonged body and soul to the new generation.  He was the\nfirst-born of Newland and May Archer, yet it had never been possible to\ninculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve.  \"What's the use of\nmaking mysteries?  It only makes people want to nose 'em out,\" he\nalways objected when enjoined to discretion.  But Archer, meeting his\neyes, saw the filial light under their banter.\n\n\"My Fanny?\"\n\n\"Well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't,\"\ncontinued his surprising son.\n\n\"I didn't,\" echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity.\n\n\"No: you date, you see, dear old boy.  But mother said--\"\n\n\"Your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes: the day before she died.  It was when she sent for me alone--you\nremember?  She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would\nbe, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you\nmost wanted.\"\n\nArcher received this strange communication in silence.  His eyes\nremained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the\nwindow.  At length he said in a low voice:  \"She never asked me.\"\n\n\"No.  I forgot.  You never did ask each other anything, did you?  And\nyou never told each other anything.  You just sat and watched each\nother, and guessed at what was going on underneath.  A deaf-and-dumb\nasylum, in fact!  Well, I back your generation for knowing more about\neach other's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about\nour own.--I say, Dad,\" Dallas broke off, \"you're not angry with me?  If\nyou are, let's make it up and go and lunch at Henri's.  I've got to\nrush out to Versailles afterward.\"\n\nArcher did not accompany his son to Versailles.  He preferred to spend\nthe afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris.  He had to deal all\nat once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate\nlifetime.\n\nAfter a little while he did not regret Dallas's indiscretion.  It\nseemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all,\nsome one had guessed and pitied....  And that it should have been his\nwife moved him indescribably.  Dallas, for all his affectionate\ninsight, would not have understood that.  To the boy, no doubt, the\nepisode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted\nforces.  But was it really no more?  For a long time Archer sat on a\nbench in the Champs Elysees and wondered, while the stream of life\nrolled by....\n\nA few streets away, a few hours away, Ellen Olenska waited.  She had\nnever gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years\nbefore, she had made no change in her way of living.  There was nothing\nnow to keep her and Archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her.\n\nHe got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries\ngardens to the Louvre.  She had once told him that she often went\nthere, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place\nwhere he could think of her as perhaps having lately been.  For an hour\nor more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of\nafternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their\nhalf-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of\nbeauty.  After all, his life had been too starved....\n\nSuddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying:  \"But\nI'm only fifty-seven--\" and then he turned away.  For such summer\ndreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of\nfriendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.\n\nHe went back to the hotel, where he and Dallas were to meet; and\ntogether they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the\nbridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nDallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father's mind, was\ntalking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles.  He had had but one\nprevious glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to\npack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with\nthe family to Switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure\ncriticism tripped each other up on his lips.\n\nAs Archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness\nincreased.  The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the\nfacility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a\nmaster but as an equal.  \"That's it: they feel equal to things--they\nknow their way about,\" he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman\nof the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and\nwith them the sign-posts and the danger-signal.\n\nSuddenly Dallas stopped short, grasping his father's arm.  \"Oh, by\nJove,\" he exclaimed.\n\nThey had come out into the great tree-planted space before the\nInvalides.  The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding\ntrees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself\nall the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol\nof the race's glory.\n\nArcher knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the\navenues radiating from the Invalides; and he had pictured the quarter\nas quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit\nit up.  Now, by some queer process of association, that golden light\nbecame for him the pervading illumination in which she lived.  For\nnearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely\nlittle--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to\nbe too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs.  He thought of the\ntheatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at,\nthe sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people\nshe must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities,\nimages and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a\nsetting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young\nFrenchman who had once said to him:  \"Ah, good conversation--there is\nnothing like it, is there?\"\n\nArcher had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty\nyears; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame\nOlenska's existence.  More than half a lifetime divided them, and she\nhad spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society\nhe but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly\nunderstand.  During that time he had been living with his youthful\nmemory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible\ncompanionship.  Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something\napart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim\nchapel, where there was not time to pray every day....\n\nThey had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of\nthe thoroughfares flanking the building.  It was a quiet quarter, after\nall, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one\nan idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this\nwere left to the few and the indifferent.\n\nThe day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by\na yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square\ninto which they had turned.  Dallas stopped again, and looked up.\n\n\"It must be here,\" he said, slipping his arm through his father's with\na movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood\ntogether looking up at the house.\n\nIt was a modern building, without distinctive character, but\nmany-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured\nfront.  On one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the\nrounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were\nstill lowered, as though the sun had just left it.\n\n\"I wonder which floor--?\" Dallas conjectured; and moving toward the\nporte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to\nsay:  \"The fifth.  It must be the one with the awnings.\"\n\nArcher remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end\nof their pilgrimage had been attained.\n\n\"I say, you know, it's nearly six,\" his son at length reminded him.\n\nThe father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees.\n\n\"I believe I'll sit there a moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Why--aren't you well?\" his son exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, perfectly.  But I should like you, please, to go up without me.\"\n\nDallas paused before him, visibly bewildered.  \"But, I say, Dad: do you\nmean you won't come up at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Archer slowly.\n\n\"If you don't she won't understand.\"\n\n\"Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you.\"\n\nDallas gave him a long look through the twilight.\n\n\"But what on earth shall I say?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?\" his father\nrejoined with a smile.\n\n\"Very well.  I shall say you're old-fashioned, and prefer walking up\nthe five flights because you don't like lifts.\"\n\nHis father smiled again.  \"Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough.\"\n\nDallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture,\npassed out of sight under the vaulted doorway.\n\nArcher sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged\nbalcony.  He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up\nin the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to\nthe hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  He pictured Dallas\nentering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful\nsmile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy\n\"took after him.\"\n\nThen he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at\nthat sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark\nlady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out\na long thin hand with three rings on it....  He thought she would be\nsitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her\non a table.\n\n\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard\nhimself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose\nits edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each\nother.\n\nHe sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes\nnever turning from the balcony.  At length a light shone through the\nwindows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew\nup the awnings, and closed the shutters.\n\nAt that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got\nup slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.\n\n\n\n\nA Note on the Text\n\nThe Age of Innocence first appeared in four large installments in The\nPictorial Review, from July to October 1920.

He thinks about his son Dallas and his daughter Mary. Mary married one of Reggie Chivers1s dullest sons. Dallas became an architect and Newland became a politician, briefly. Newland realizes that he has become a \"good citizen\" although he has missed the \"flower of life. Newland respected the duty of marriage and mourned when May died. Dallas calls his father on the telephone and tells him that he is going to Paris on business; Newland must accompany him. Newland reflects that so much had changed in his world. Dallas, his eldest son, was in fact marrying on e of :Beaufort1s bastards\", Fanny Beaufort, and no one cared. Newland goes to Paris with his son; there, Dallas informs him that Ellen is expecting them in the evening. Dallas says that Newland should definitely go see her because Ellen was once \"Newland1s Fanny\", the \"woman Newland would have chucked everything for, but didn1t. Dallas reveals that May said, on her death bed, that she asked Newland to give up the thing he wanted most, and he did. Newland says simply, \"She didn1t ask. Dallas then remarks that May and Newland never told each other anything; they lived in a silent \"deaf and dumb asylum. When Newland and Dallas arrive in Ellen1s neighborhood; Newland decided that he doesn1t want to go up and see her. When Dallas asks him what she should say on his behalf, he says, say that I1m \"Old-fashioned. Dallas goes to see Ellen and Newland sits on the bench outside her building for a long time; when a servant comes to shut her shutters, Newland decides to leave the neighborhood.","summary_analysis":"This chapter is written to show, quite ironically, that all the prohibitions that \"bent and bound\" Newland no longer exist a generation later. His son Dallas is able to live the life that Newland would have lived if he had not had Society choosing the women he mustt marry, the profession he would have, the way he would speak. Dallas makes fun of Newland for living such a life without passion, living in a \"deaf and dumb asylum\" for so many years. Newland even recognizes that the death of May has liberated him to finally be with his true love, Ellen, but habit has made him a coward and trapped in the same day-to-day life. What is so sad about the ending is that earlier in the novel there was always someone to blame for why Newland and Ellen could not be together. First, Ellen was still married; then the wedding was moved forward; then May was pregnant. But now, at the end, there is nothing stopping Newland from meeting Ellen. But Newland has become so inculcated by his old society values that he can1t even act when there are no prohibitions. Now, the theme of the book becomes tricky. Prior to this chapter, one could make an easy case that Society prevented people from realizing their dreams. But now we see, that it is Newland1s own cowardice that prevents him from being happy. Society becomes just an excuse for why people don1t seek out their dreams. Beaufort is an example of a man from his own generation who found happiness despite the regulations, his own financial destruction and the disdain of society. Wharton1s point seems to be that people should not blame their society for their inability to act the rules and norms of society change rapidly, so it is only one1s personal standards that can be constant and abided by","summary_length":286.0,"analysis_length":312.0,"chap_int":34,"previous summary id":["chapter 33","chapter 33","chapters 31-33"],"previous chapter":["The Archers begin setting up for their first dinner party, \"a big event\" for a young couple. The party will be in honor of Ellen Olenska leaving New York and returning to Europe. Although Ellen had not spoken to Newland in ten days, he returned a key that he had given her earlier in a blank envelope. Newland is assigned the job of evaluating Ellen1s trust. All the while that he is taking care of her finances, he think that there will be an affair between the two in the future. His belief in the future keeps him from writing her. The night of the dinner party Ellen looks pale, \"lusterless and almost ugly. But still, Newland had never loved her face as much as he did at that moment. Newland notices that Ellen1s hand is ungloved. Newland thinks, \"If it were only to see her hand again I should have to follow her \" Normally only \"foreign visitors\" would be important enough to sit at the hosts left and take the place of Mrs. van der Luyden. But, they make an exception and let Ellen sit to the host1s left because, \"There were certain things that had to be done, and If done at all, done handsomely and thoroughly; and one of these in the old New York code, was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe. Newland realizes that everyone thinks that a true \"affair\" had been going on between Newland and Ellen; the celebration is really because the \"separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved. It was the New York way to take a life without any traces of blood. Everyone sits at the table discussing travel in a dispassionate way. Newland looks at Ellen; he imagines she is thinking, \"Let1s see it through,\" which means, let1s have our affair as planned. All the men retire to the library after dinner, and discuss how their society is changing. Larry Lefferts says, \"If things go on at this pace we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers1 houses and marrying Beaufort1s bastards. Later that evening, May asks if it is alright if they have a talk. Newland tries to tell her that he is tired of life and wants to go on a long trip; May says, that he can1t go because she found out today that she is pregnant. Newland has a \"sick stare\" and asks who she has told. She says that she1s told Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Welland and. Ellen. She had told Ellen about it two weeks ago. Newland asks her why she would tell Ellen about her pregnancy if she was not sure about it until today. She says, \"I wasn1t sure then, but I told her I was.","About ten days after Ellen's departure for Washington, DC, May decides to hold a farewell dinner for Ellen. A day after Ellen had departed, Mr. Letterblair had discussed with Archer some arrangements Mrs. Manson Mingott had made to set up a trust for Ellen with sufficient funds so that she could live independently in Paris. Ellen will live with Marchioness Manson. On the evening of the dinner party, everyone arrives, including the van der Luydens, the Lefferts, the Selfridge Merrys, etc. Finally, Madame Olenska arrives but she and Archer don't have much of a chance to talk alone. Archer has a few polite words with Madame Olenska at dinner, and then he asks Reggie Chivers very loudly whether Chivers would like to travel the world with him. Chivers isn't into the idea, but Mr. Selfridge Merry uses this comment as an opportunity to talk about his adventures traveling the world. Later, in the library, Lefferts goes on about how vulgar the Beauforts are. Then the gentlemen join the women in the drawing room, where Archer is struck by how impossible the women have made it for him to talk with Madame Olenska. As Madame Olenska exits, Archer helps her on with her cloak and thinks he might have a few words alone with her. But Mrs. van der Luyden swoops in and says that Madame Olenska is going home with them. As the guests leave, Lefferts asks Archer to cover for him the next time, presumably so that Lefferts can have an affair with a typist. Later, Archer sits alone in the library when May comes in, wanting to talk about how wonderful the dinner party was. Archer tells May that he would like to travel, preferably someplace distant such as India or Japan. May says that would be quite impossible since she is pregnant. She doesn't say so explicitly, but it is understood between them. Archer is unpleasantly surprised. May says she knew she was pregnant since that morning, when she had told both her mother and his. She also tells Archer that she told Ellen when they had their conversation a couple weeks ago. Archer asks her how she could have, if she had only been certain of her pregnancy that morning. May admits that she wasn't sure, but she told Ellen anyway. It turns out she was right.","Newland's plan is to speak to Ellen, find out what train she will take to Washington, join her, and run away with her to Japan. He will leave a note for May. However, he drops this plan with relief when he learns from Mrs. Mingott that Ellen will be staying with her. On his walk home, he sees Ellen leaving the Beaufort house and stops to speak with her. Unfortunately, Lawrence Lefferts and young Chivers are passing and see them. Newland winces at their discovery and wonders how he and Ellen can live such a covert existence. He pleads with Ellen to meet him alone at the Metropolitan Museum the next day, but she appears to dislike this idea. Despite his earlier theoretical championship of Ellen's freedom as a single woman, his next words indicate his real feelings because after she leaves he says, almost contemptuously, \"she'll come!\" The following day, they meet at the museum amidst the wreckage of earlier civilizations. Discussing their future, she explains that her stay with her grandmother is to keep them from \"doing irreparable harm\" to those who love them. However, she reluctantly gives in to Newland's pressure; she agrees to a future brief sexual encounter, after which she is determined go back to Europe. He feels this intimacy will give him the power to pressure her into staying. Then Newland goes home to May who greets him with the news that she saw Ellen at Mrs. Mingott's and they had \"a really good talk.\" She feels she has misjudged Ellen. The following evening, the van der Luydens attend a small dinner at Mrs. Archer's home before going to the opera. Sillerton Jackson, Newland, and May are also there. They discuss Ellen at some length and disapprove of her taking Mrs. Mingott's carriage to the Beaufort's house. After dinner they attend the opera and Newland recalls that it was the same opera they saw the night he met Ellen. May is wearing her made-over wedding dress and she looks the same after two years except for her paleness. He remembers her saying that she could not have her happiness made out of a wrong to someone else. Deciding to confess all and ask for his freedom, Newland pleads a headache and they go home. At home they settle into the library, but before he can confess, May reveals that Mrs. Manson Mingott has given Ellen an allowance and she is going back to Europe. May had received a letter from Ellen that very afternoon saying that it would be useless for her friends to urge her to change her mind. Cryptically, May adds, \"I think she understands everything,\" and goes to bed. Newland is dumbfounded. Newland later meets with Mrs. Mingott and when he returns home that evening, May announces a going-away dinner for Ellen. She is very assertive when Newland questions her reasons, and she explains that her mother agrees it is the thing to do. The farewell dinner will be their first big dinner since their marriage. It has been 10 days since Newland saw Ellen and he muses that she will return to Europe and he will follow. The night of the dinner arrives and when all are assembled Ellen appears, pale and \"lusterless.\" Every glance at her reminds Newland of memories of his love. Now that Ellen is leaving, the Mingotts and Wellands express their affection for her; it is obvious to Newland that this is \"a tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.\" Suddenly, Newland realizes that the entire family believes he and Ellen are lovers and they are separating them in the most civilized manner possible. Throughout the evening, Newland and Ellen exchange pleasantries, aware that all eyes are on them. The gentlemen retire to their cigars. Lefferts expounds on the decline of values in New York society, and eventually the men return to the drawing room and \"May's triumphant eyes.\" Newland realizes she shares the belief that he and Ellen are lovers. May kisses Ellen's cheek, vanquishing the foe, and Newland accompanies Ellen to the hall, putting her cloak on her shoulders. When he thinks they might be alone for a moment, the van der Luydens appear and announce they are driving Ellen. He tells her that he will see her soon in Paris, and she correctly says it would be nice if he and May could come. Then she is gone. The dinner is over and Newland and May are in the library. Newland starts to confess once again, but says instead that he needs to go on a long trip because he is very tired. May explains that the doctor might not let her go along, and she reveals that she has already told both her mother and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. It dawns on Newland that the conversation she had with Ellen two weeks earlier was about her pregnancy. She watches Newland intently as she asks if he minds. In questioning her, he finds that she told Ellen this news long before she was sure."],"next summary id":"chapter 34","next chapter":"Newland is now fifty-seven and he is remembering his life while sitting at hiswriting table.

Newland Archer is sitting in his library. He has just returned from the opening of the new galleries in the Metropolitan Museum. The memory of the Cesnola galleries reminded him of his talk with Madame Olenska there. Over those years, he has had three children with May: Dallas, Mary, and Bill. May passed away a couple of years ago nursing the youngest child through pneumonia. Mary is married to one of the Chivers's sons. Dallas is working with an architecture firm in Chicago and engaged to be married to Fanny Beaufort, Mr. Julius Beaufort's daughter. Fanny Beaufort has an interesting history. Few remember Beaufort's disaster, and when his wife died, he had married his mistress, Fanny Ring, and they had a daughter, Fanny Beaufort. When the Beauforts died, May's brother and sister-in-law had been appointed her guardian. Fanny has been completely accepted by New York society. Newland Archer has built up a reputation for himself as a \\\"good citizen.\\\" He spent a year in politics, and counts the Governor of New York as one of his friends. Mostly he spends his time with philanthropic causes. He receives a phone call from Dallas, who invites him to go to Europe with him. Newland agrees. The day after their arrival in Paris, Dallas informs his father that they have been invited to visit Countess Olenska at 5:30. Dallas promised Fanny that he would visit her since Countess Olenska was so kind to Fanny when Fanny went to a convent school in Paris. Dallas asks his father frankly whether Countess Olenska was his \\\"Fanny,\\\" i.e. lover. He tells his father that the day before his mother died, his mother had told him that they would be safe with his father because when she had asked him to give up the one thing he wanted most, he had done so. Archer replies that May never asked. Dallas doesn't think that's unusual, since he's accustomed to his parents silently agreeing on things. While Dallas spends the day at Versailles, Archer visits the Louvre. He remembers the Countess saying she liked the Louvre. Archer and Dallas meet up again at the hotel, and cross the Place des Invalides on the way over to Countess Olenska's together. When they arrive, Archer informs Dallas that he doesn't want to see Countess Olenska after all, and sits outside as Dallas goes inside. He fantasizes about what is going on in Countess Olenska's rooms as he sits outside on a bench and looks up at her open windows. When a servant comes out to close the shutters, Archer gets up and walks back alone to his hotel.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"\nNewland Archer sat at the writing-table in his library in East\nThirty-ninth Street.\n\nHe had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration\nof the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, and the spectacle of\nthose great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages, where the\nthrong of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically\ncatalogued treasures, had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory.\n\n\"Why, this used to be one of the old Cesnola rooms,\" he heard some one\nsay; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting\nalone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight figure\nin a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely-fitted vista of\nthe old Museum.\n\nThe vision had roused a host of other associations, and he sat looking\nwith new eyes at the library which, for over thirty years, had been the\nscene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations.\n\nIt was the room in which most of the real things of his life had\nhappened.  There his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to\nhim, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young\nwomen of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a\nchild; and there their eldest boy, Dallas, too delicate to be taken to\nchurch in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the Bishop\nof New York, the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop, so long the\npride and ornament of his diocese.  There Dallas had first staggered\nacross the floor shouting \"Dad,\" while May and the nurse laughed behind\nthe door; there their second child, Mary (who was so like her mother),\nhad announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of Reggie\nChivers's many sons; and there Archer had kissed her through her\nwedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them\nto Grace Church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its\nfoundations the \"Grace Church wedding\" remained an unchanged\ninstitution.\n\nIt was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future\nof the children: the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill,\nMary's incurable indifference to \"accomplishments,\" and passion for\nsport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward \"art\" which had\nfinally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a\nrising New York architect.\n\nThe young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and\nbusiness and taking up all sorts of new things.  If they were not\nabsorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that\nthey were going in for Central American archaeology, for architecture\nor landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the\nprerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting\nGeorgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word\n\"Colonial.\"  Nobody nowadays had \"Colonial\" houses except the\nmillionaire grocers of the suburbs.\n\nBut above all--sometimes Archer put it above all--it was in that\nlibrary that the Governor of New York, coming down from Albany one\nevening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said,\nbanging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses:\n\"Hang the professional politician!  You're the kind of man the country\nwants, Archer.  If the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you\nhave got to lend a hand in the cleaning.\"\n\n\"Men like you--\" how Archer had glowed at the phrase!  How eagerly he\nhad risen up at the call!  It was an echo of Ned Winsett's old appeal\nto roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man\nwho set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was\nirresistible.\n\nArcher, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself WERE what\nhis country needed, at least in the active service to which Theodore\nRoosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not,\nfor after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re-elected, and\nhad dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and\nfrom that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the\nreforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its\napathy.  It was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered\nto what the young men of his generation and his set had looked\nforward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which\ntheir vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new\nstate of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built\nwall.  He had done little in public life; he would always be by nature\na contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to\ncontemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man's friendship\nto be his strength and pride.\n\nHe had been, in short, what people were beginning to call \"a good\ncitizen.\"  In New York, for many years past, every new movement,\nphilanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion\nand wanted his name.  People said:  \"Ask Archer\" when there was a\nquestion of starting the first school for crippled children,\nreorganising the Museum of Art, founding the Grolier Club, inaugurating\nthe new Library, or getting up a new society of chamber music.  His\ndays were full, and they were filled decently.  He supposed it was all\na man ought to ask.\n\nSomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life.  But he thought of\nit now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined\nwould have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first\nprize in a lottery.  There were a hundred million tickets in HIS\nlottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too\ndecidedly against him.  When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was\nabstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a\nbook or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he\nhad missed.  That vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him\nfrom thinking of other women.  He had been what was called a faithful\nhusband; and when May had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious\npneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had\nhonestly mourned her.  Their long years together had shown him that it\ndid not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept\nthe dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of\nugly appetites.  Looking about him, he honoured his own past, and\nmourned for it.  After all, there was good in the old ways.\n\nHis eyes, making the round of the room--done over by Dallas with\nEnglish mezzotints, Chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white\nand pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old Eastlake\nwriting-table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his\nfirst photograph of May, which still kept its place beside his inkstand.\n\nThere she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin\nand flapping Leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the\nMission garden.  And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;\nnever quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous,\nfaithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of\ngrowth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt\nitself without her ever being conscious of the change.  This hard\nbright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered.\nHer incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their\nviews from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first,\na joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in\nwhich father and children had unconsciously collaborated.  And she had\ndied thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious\nhouseholds like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was\nconvinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate\nin Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his\nparents' lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her)\nwould transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.  And of Mary she was\nsure as of her own self.  So, having snatched little Bill from the\ngrave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her\nplace in the Archer vault in St.  Mark's, where Mrs. Archer already lay\nsafe from the terrifying \"trend\" which her daughter-in-law had never\neven become aware of.\n\nOpposite May's portrait stood one of her daughter.  Mary Chivers was as\ntall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and\nslightly slouching, as the altered fashion required.  Mary Chivers's\nmighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the\ntwenty-inch waist that May Archer's azure sash so easily spanned.  And\nthe difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely\ngirt as her figure.  Mary, who was no less conventional, and no more\nintelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.  There\nwas good in the new order too.\n\nThe telephone clicked, and Archer, turning from the photographs,\nunhooked the transmitter at his elbow.  How far they were from the days\nwhen the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been New York's\nonly means of quick communication!\n\n\"Chicago wants you.\"\n\nAh--it must be a long-distance from Dallas, who had been sent to\nChicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the Lakeside palace they\nwere to build for a young millionaire with ideas.  The firm always sent\nDallas on such errands.\n\n\"Hallo, Dad--Yes: Dallas.  I say--how do you feel about sailing on\nWednesday?  Mauretania: Yes, next Wednesday as ever is.  Our client\nwants me to look at some Italian gardens before we settle anything, and\nhas asked me to nip over on the next boat.  I've got to be back on the\nfirst of June--\" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--\"so we\nmust look alive.  I say, Dad, I want your help: do come.\"\n\nDallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and\nnatural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the\nfire.  The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer, for\nlong-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as\nelectric lighting and five-day Atlantic voyages.  But the laugh did\nstartle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and\nmiles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and\nbusy indifferent millions--Dallas's laugh should be able to say: \"Of\ncourse, whatever happens, I must get back on the first, because Fanny\nBeaufort and I are to be married on the fifth.\"\n\nThe voice began again:  \"Think it over?  No, sir: not a minute.  You've\ngot to say yes now.  Why not, I'd like to know?  If you can allege a\nsingle reason--No; I knew it.  Then it's a go, eh?  Because I count on\nyou to ring up the Cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you'd better\nbook a return on a boat from Marseilles.  I say, Dad; it'll be our last\ntime together, in this kind of way--.  Oh, good!  I knew you would.\"\n\nChicago rang off, and Archer rose and began to pace up and down the\nroom.\n\nIt would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was\nright.  They would have lots of other \"times\" after Dallas's marriage,\nhis father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and Fanny\nBeaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to\ninterfere with their intimacy.  On the contrary, from what he had seen\nof her, he thought she would be naturally included in it.  Still,\nchange was change, and differences were differences, and much as he\nfelt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting\nto seize this last chance of being alone with his boy.\n\nThere was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one\nthat he had lost the habit of travel.  May had disliked to move except\nfor valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the\nmountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in\nThirty-ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands' in\nNewport.  After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty\nto travel for six months; and the whole family had made the\nold-fashioned tour through England, Switzerland and Italy.  Their time\nbeing limited (no one knew why) they had omitted France.  Archer\nremembered Dallas's wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc\ninstead of Rheims and Chartres.  But Mary and Bill wanted\nmountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in Dallas's wake\nthrough the English cathedrals; and May, always fair to her children,\nhad insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and\nartistic proclivities.  She had indeed proposed that her husband should\ngo to Paris for a fortnight, and join them on the Italian lakes after\nthey had \"done\" Switzerland; but Archer had declined.  \"We'll stick\ntogether,\" he said; and May's face had brightened at his setting such a\ngood example to Dallas.\n\nSince her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for\nhis continuing in the same routine.  His children had urged him to\ntravel: Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad\nand \"see the galleries.\"  The very mysteriousness of such a cure made\nher the more confident of its efficacy.  But Archer had found himself\nheld fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from\nnew things.\n\nNow, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk.\nThe worst of doing one's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for\ndoing anything else.  At least that was the view that the men of his\ngeneration had taken.  The trenchant divisions between right and wrong,\nhonest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little\nscope for the unforeseen.  There are moments when a man's imagination,\nso easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily\nlevel, and surveys the long windings of destiny.  Archer hung there and\nwondered....\n\nWhat was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose\nstandards had bent and bound him?  He remembered a sneering prophecy of\npoor Lawrence Lefferts's, uttered years ago in that very room:  \"If\nthings go on at this rate, our children will be marrying Beaufort's\nbastards.\"\n\nIt was just what Archer's eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing;\nand nobody wondered or reproved.  Even the boy's Aunt Janey, who still\nlooked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her\nmother's emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and\ncarried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and\nFanny Beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a\n\"set\" from a Paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned\nbeauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an\nIsabey miniature.\n\nFanny Beaufort, who had appeared in New York at eighteen, after the\ndeath of her parents, had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won\nit thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid\nof her, society took her joyfully for granted.  She was pretty, amusing\nand accomplished: what more did any one want?  Nobody was narrow-minded\nenough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father's\npast and her own origin.  Only the older people remembered so obscure\nan incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort's failure, or\nthe fact that after his wife's death he had been quietly married to the\nnotorious Fanny Ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a\nlittle girl who inherited her beauty.  He was subsequently heard of in\nConstantinople, then in Russia; and a dozen years later American\ntravellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres, where he\nrepresented a large insurance agency.  He and his wife died there in\nthe odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had\nappeared in New York in charge of May Archer's sister-in-law, Mrs. Jack\nWelland, whose husband had been appointed the girl's guardian.  The\nfact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer's\nchildren, and nobody was surprised when Dallas's engagement was\nannounced.\n\nNothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the\nworld had travelled.  People nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms\nand \"movements,\" with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much\nabout their neighbours.  And of what account was anybody's past, in the\nhuge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same\nplane?\n\nNewland Archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety\nof the Paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and\neagerness of youth.\n\nIt was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening\nwaistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot\ntemples.  He wondered if it was thus that his son's conducted itself in\nthe presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort--and decided that it was not.  \"It\nfunctions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different,\" he\nreflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had\nannounced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would\napprove.\n\n\"The difference is that these young people take it for granted that\nthey're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took\nit for granted that we shouldn't.  Only, I wonder--the thing one's so\ncertain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?\"\n\nIt was the day after their arrival in Paris, and the spring sunshine\nheld Archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the\nPlace Vendome.  One of the things he had stipulated--almost the only\none--when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas, was that, in Paris,\nhe shouldn't be made to go to one of the newfangled \"palaces.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right--of course,\" Dallas good-naturedly agreed.  \"I'll take\nyou to some jolly old-fashioned place--the Bristol say--\" leaving his\nfather speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and\nemperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for\nits quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour.\n\nArcher had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the\nscene of his return to Paris; then the personal vision had faded, and\nhe had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska's\nlife.  Sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had\ngone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the\navenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public\ngardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll\nof the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and\npleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting.  Now the spectacle\nwas before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy,\nold-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the\nruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being....\n\nDallas's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder.  \"Hullo, father: this\nis something like, isn't it?\"  They stood for a while looking out in\nsilence, and then the young man continued:  \"By the way, I've got a\nmessage for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half-past\nfive.\"\n\nHe said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual\nitem of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave\nfor Florence the next evening.  Archer looked at him, and thought he\nsaw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother Mingott's\nmalice.\n\n\"Oh, didn't I tell you?\" Dallas pursued.  \"Fanny made me swear to do\nthree things while I was in Paris: get her the score of the last\nDebussy songs, go to the Grand-Guignol and see Madame Olenska.  You\nknow she was awfully good to Fanny when Mr. Beaufort sent her over from\nBuenos Ayres to the Assomption.  Fanny hadn't any friends in Paris, and\nMadame Olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays.\nI believe she was a great friend of the first Mrs. Beaufort's.  And\nshe's our cousin, of course.  So I rang her up this morning, before I\nwent out, and told her you and I were here for two days and wanted to\nsee her.\"\n\nArcher continued to stare at him.  \"You told her I was here?\"\n\n\"Of course--why not?\"  Dallas's eye brows went up whimsically.  Then,\ngetting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father's with a\nconfidential pressure.\n\n\"I say, father: what was she like?\"\n\nArcher felt his colour rise under his son's unabashed gaze.  \"Come, own\nup: you and she were great pals, weren't you?  Wasn't she most awfully\nlovely?\"\n\n\"Lovely?  I don't know.  She was different.\"\n\n\"Ah--there you have it!  That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?\nWhen she comes, SHE'S DIFFERENT--and one doesn't know why.  It's\nexactly what I feel about Fanny.\"\n\nHis father drew back a step, releasing his arm.  \"About Fanny?  But, my\ndear fellow--I should hope so!  Only I don't see--\"\n\n\"Dash it, Dad, don't be prehistoric!  Wasn't she--once--your Fanny?\"\n\nDallas belonged body and soul to the new generation.  He was the\nfirst-born of Newland and May Archer, yet it had never been possible to\ninculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve.  \"What's the use of\nmaking mysteries?  It only makes people want to nose 'em out,\" he\nalways objected when enjoined to discretion.  But Archer, meeting his\neyes, saw the filial light under their banter.\n\n\"My Fanny?\"\n\n\"Well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't,\"\ncontinued his surprising son.\n\n\"I didn't,\" echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity.\n\n\"No: you date, you see, dear old boy.  But mother said--\"\n\n\"Your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes: the day before she died.  It was when she sent for me alone--you\nremember?  She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would\nbe, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you\nmost wanted.\"\n\nArcher received this strange communication in silence.  His eyes\nremained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the\nwindow.  At length he said in a low voice:  \"She never asked me.\"\n\n\"No.  I forgot.  You never did ask each other anything, did you?  And\nyou never told each other anything.  You just sat and watched each\nother, and guessed at what was going on underneath.  A deaf-and-dumb\nasylum, in fact!  Well, I back your generation for knowing more about\neach other's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about\nour own.--I say, Dad,\" Dallas broke off, \"you're not angry with me?  If\nyou are, let's make it up and go and lunch at Henri's.  I've got to\nrush out to Versailles afterward.\"\n\nArcher did not accompany his son to Versailles.  He preferred to spend\nthe afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris.  He had to deal all\nat once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate\nlifetime.\n\nAfter a little while he did not regret Dallas's indiscretion.  It\nseemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all,\nsome one had guessed and pitied....  And that it should have been his\nwife moved him indescribably.  Dallas, for all his affectionate\ninsight, would not have understood that.  To the boy, no doubt, the\nepisode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted\nforces.  But was it really no more?  For a long time Archer sat on a\nbench in the Champs Elysees and wondered, while the stream of life\nrolled by....\n\nA few streets away, a few hours away, Ellen Olenska waited.  She had\nnever gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years\nbefore, she had made no change in her way of living.  There was nothing\nnow to keep her and Archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her.\n\nHe got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries\ngardens to the Louvre.  She had once told him that she often went\nthere, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place\nwhere he could think of her as perhaps having lately been.  For an hour\nor more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of\nafternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their\nhalf-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of\nbeauty.  After all, his life had been too starved....\n\nSuddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying:  \"But\nI'm only fifty-seven--\" and then he turned away.  For such summer\ndreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of\nfriendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.\n\nHe went back to the hotel, where he and Dallas were to meet; and\ntogether they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the\nbridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nDallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father's mind, was\ntalking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles.  He had had but one\nprevious glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to\npack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with\nthe family to Switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure\ncriticism tripped each other up on his lips.\n\nAs Archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness\nincreased.  The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the\nfacility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a\nmaster but as an equal.  \"That's it: they feel equal to things--they\nknow their way about,\" he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman\nof the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and\nwith them the sign-posts and the danger-signal.\n\nSuddenly Dallas stopped short, grasping his father's arm.  \"Oh, by\nJove,\" he exclaimed.\n\nThey had come out into the great tree-planted space before the\nInvalides.  The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding\ntrees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself\nall the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol\nof the race's glory.\n\nArcher knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the\navenues radiating from the Invalides; and he had pictured the quarter\nas quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit\nit up.  Now, by some queer process of association, that golden light\nbecame for him the pervading illumination in which she lived.  For\nnearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely\nlittle--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to\nbe too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs.  He thought of the\ntheatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at,\nthe sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people\nshe must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities,\nimages and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a\nsetting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young\nFrenchman who had once said to him:  \"Ah, good conversation--there is\nnothing like it, is there?\"\n\nArcher had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty\nyears; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame\nOlenska's existence.  More than half a lifetime divided them, and she\nhad spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society\nhe but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly\nunderstand.  During that time he had been living with his youthful\nmemory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible\ncompanionship.  Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something\napart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim\nchapel, where there was not time to pray every day....\n\nThey had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of\nthe thoroughfares flanking the building.  It was a quiet quarter, after\nall, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one\nan idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this\nwere left to the few and the indifferent.\n\nThe day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by\na yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square\ninto which they had turned.  Dallas stopped again, and looked up.\n\n\"It must be here,\" he said, slipping his arm through his father's with\na movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood\ntogether looking up at the house.\n\nIt was a modern building, without distinctive character, but\nmany-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured\nfront.  On one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the\nrounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were\nstill lowered, as though the sun had just left it.\n\n\"I wonder which floor--?\" Dallas conjectured; and moving toward the\nporte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to\nsay:  \"The fifth.  It must be the one with the awnings.\"\n\nArcher remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end\nof their pilgrimage had been attained.\n\n\"I say, you know, it's nearly six,\" his son at length reminded him.\n\nThe father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees.\n\n\"I believe I'll sit there a moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Why--aren't you well?\" his son exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, perfectly.  But I should like you, please, to go up without me.\"\n\nDallas paused before him, visibly bewildered.  \"But, I say, Dad: do you\nmean you won't come up at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Archer slowly.\n\n\"If you don't she won't understand.\"\n\n\"Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you.\"\n\nDallas gave him a long look through the twilight.\n\n\"But what on earth shall I say?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?\" his father\nrejoined with a smile.\n\n\"Very well.  I shall say you're old-fashioned, and prefer walking up\nthe five flights because you don't like lifts.\"\n\nHis father smiled again.  \"Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough.\"\n\nDallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture,\npassed out of sight under the vaulted doorway.\n\nArcher sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged\nbalcony.  He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up\nin the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to\nthe hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  He pictured Dallas\nentering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful\nsmile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy\n\"took after him.\"\n\nThen he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at\nthat sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark\nlady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out\na long thin hand with three rings on it....  He thought she would be\nsitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her\non a table.\n\n\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard\nhimself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose\nits edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each\nother.\n\nHe sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes\nnever turning from the balcony.  At length a light shone through the\nwindows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew\nup the awnings, and closed the shutters.\n\nAt that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got\nup slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.\n\n\n\n\nA Note on the Text\n\nThe Age of Innocence first appeared in four large installments in The\nPictorial Review, from July to October 1920.

The party will be in honor of Ellen Olenska leaving New York and returning to Europe. Although Ellen had not spoken to Newland in ten days, he returned a key that he had given her earlier in a blank envelope. Newland is assigned the job of evaluating Ellen1s trust. All the while that he is taking care of her finances, he think that there will be an affair between the two in the future. His belief in the future keeps him from writing her. The night of the dinner party Ellen looks pale, \"lusterless and almost ugly. But still, Newland had never loved her face as much as he did at that moment. Newland notices that Ellen1s hand is ungloved. Newland thinks, \"If it were only to see her hand again I should have to follow her \" Normally only \"foreign visitors\" would be important enough to sit at the hosts left and take the place of Mrs. van der Luyden. But, they make an exception and let Ellen sit to the host1s left because, \"There were certain things that had to be done, and If done at all, done handsomely and thoroughly; and one of these in the old New York code, was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe. Newland realizes that everyone thinks that a true \"affair\" had been going on between Newland and Ellen; the celebration is really because the \"separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved. It was the New York way to take a life without any traces of blood. Everyone sits at the table discussing travel in a dispassionate way. Newland looks at Ellen; he imagines she is thinking, \"Let1s see it through,\" which means, let1s have our affair as planned. All the men retire to the library after dinner, and discuss how their society is changing. Larry Lefferts says, \"If things go on at this pace we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers1 houses and marrying Beaufort1s bastards. Later that evening, May asks if it is alright if they have a talk. Newland tries to tell her that he is tired of life and wants to go on a long trip; May says, that he can1t go because she found out today that she is pregnant. Newland has a \"sick stare\" and asks who she has told. She says that she1s told Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Welland and. Ellen. She had told Ellen about it two weeks ago. Newland asks her why she would tell Ellen about her pregnancy if she was not sure about it until today. She says, \"I wasn1t sure then, but I told her I was.","About ten days after Ellen's departure for Washington, DC, May decides to hold a farewell dinner for Ellen. A day after Ellen had departed, Mr. Letterblair had discussed with Archer some arrangements Mrs. Manson Mingott had made to set up a trust for Ellen with sufficient funds so that she could live independently in Paris. Ellen will live with Marchioness Manson. On the evening of the dinner party, everyone arrives, including the van der Luydens, the Lefferts, the Selfridge Merrys, etc. Finally, Madame Olenska arrives but she and Archer don't have much of a chance to talk alone. Archer has a few polite words with Madame Olenska at dinner, and then he asks Reggie Chivers very loudly whether Chivers would like to travel the world with him. Chivers isn't into the idea, but Mr. Selfridge Merry uses this comment as an opportunity to talk about his adventures traveling the world. Later, in the library, Lefferts goes on about how vulgar the Beauforts are. Then the gentlemen join the women in the drawing room, where Archer is struck by how impossible the women have made it for him to talk with Madame Olenska. As Madame Olenska exits, Archer helps her on with her cloak and thinks he might have a few words alone with her. But Mrs. van der Luyden swoops in and says that Madame Olenska is going home with them. As the guests leave, Lefferts asks Archer to cover for him the next time, presumably so that Lefferts can have an affair with a typist. Later, Archer sits alone in the library when May comes in, wanting to talk about how wonderful the dinner party was. Archer tells May that he would like to travel, preferably someplace distant such as India or Japan. May says that would be quite impossible since she is pregnant. She doesn't say so explicitly, but it is understood between them. Archer is unpleasantly surprised. May says she knew she was pregnant since that morning, when she had told both her mother and his. She also tells Archer that she told Ellen when they had their conversation a couple weeks ago. Archer asks her how she could have, if she had only been certain of her pregnancy that morning. May admits that she wasn't sure, but she told Ellen anyway. It turns out she was right.","Newland's plan is to speak to Ellen, find out what train she will take to Washington, join her, and run away with her to Japan. He will leave a note for May. However, he drops this plan with relief when he learns from Mrs. Mingott that Ellen will be staying with her. On his walk home, he sees Ellen leaving the Beaufort house and stops to speak with her. Unfortunately, Lawrence Lefferts and young Chivers are passing and see them. Newland winces at their discovery and wonders how he and Ellen can live such a covert existence. He pleads with Ellen to meet him alone at the Metropolitan Museum the next day, but she appears to dislike this idea. Despite his earlier theoretical championship of Ellen's freedom as a single woman, his next words indicate his real feelings because after she leaves he says, almost contemptuously, \"she'll come!\" The following day, they meet at the museum amidst the wreckage of earlier civilizations. Discussing their future, she explains that her stay with her grandmother is to keep them from \"doing irreparable harm\" to those who love them. However, she reluctantly gives in to Newland's pressure; she agrees to a future brief sexual encounter, after which she is determined go back to Europe. He feels this intimacy will give him the power to pressure her into staying. Then Newland goes home to May who greets him with the news that she saw Ellen at Mrs. Mingott's and they had \"a really good talk.\" She feels she has misjudged Ellen. The following evening, the van der Luydens attend a small dinner at Mrs. Archer's home before going to the opera. Sillerton Jackson, Newland, and May are also there. They discuss Ellen at some length and disapprove of her taking Mrs. Mingott's carriage to the Beaufort's house. After dinner they attend the opera and Newland recalls that it was the same opera they saw the night he met Ellen. May is wearing her made-over wedding dress and she looks the same after two years except for her paleness. He remembers her saying that she could not have her happiness made out of a wrong to someone else. Deciding to confess all and ask for his freedom, Newland pleads a headache and they go home. At home they settle into the library, but before he can confess, May reveals that Mrs. Manson Mingott has given Ellen an allowance and she is going back to Europe. May had received a letter from Ellen that very afternoon saying that it would be useless for her friends to urge her to change her mind. Cryptically, May adds, \"I think she understands everything,\" and goes to bed. Newland is dumbfounded. Newland later meets with Mrs. Mingott and when he returns home that evening, May announces a going-away dinner for Ellen. She is very assertive when Newland questions her reasons, and she explains that her mother agrees it is the thing to do. The farewell dinner will be their first big dinner since their marriage. It has been 10 days since Newland saw Ellen and he muses that she will return to Europe and he will follow. The night of the dinner arrives and when all are assembled Ellen appears, pale and \"lusterless.\" Every glance at her reminds Newland of memories of his love. Now that Ellen is leaving, the Mingotts and Wellands express their affection for her; it is obvious to Newland that this is \"a tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.\" Suddenly, Newland realizes that the entire family believes he and Ellen are lovers and they are separating them in the most civilized manner possible. Throughout the evening, Newland and Ellen exchange pleasantries, aware that all eyes are on them. The gentlemen retire to their cigars. Lefferts expounds on the decline of values in New York society, and eventually the men return to the drawing room and \"May's triumphant eyes.\" Newland realizes she shares the belief that he and Ellen are lovers. May kisses Ellen's cheek, vanquishing the foe, and Newland accompanies Ellen to the hall, putting her cloak on her shoulders. When he thinks they might be alone for a moment, the van der Luydens appear and announce they are driving Ellen. He tells her that he will see her soon in Paris, and she correctly says it would be nice if he and May could come. Then she is gone. The dinner is over and Newland and May are in the library. Newland starts to confess once again, but says instead that he needs to go on a long trip because he is very tired. May explains that the doctor might not let her go along, and she reveals that she has already told both her mother and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. It dawns on Newland that the conversation she had with Ellen two weeks earlier was about her pregnancy. She watches Newland intently as she asks if he minds. In questioning her, he finds that she told Ellen this news long before she was sure."],"next summary id":"chapter 34","next chapter":"Twenty-six years have passed.

He is in a reflective mood, brought about by his memories of meeting the Countess there years ago. In his library he remembers May announcing her pregnancy; their delicate son, Dallas, being christened and later taking his first steps; their daughter, Mary, becoming engaged to one of Reggie Chivers' dull sons and her radiant face as Newland kissed her here on her wedding day; and his conversations with Theodore Roosevelt, a family friend, who stayed overnight. Roosevelt talked Newland into running for public office, as Ned Winsett had often urged him to do. Spending only one term in the State Assembly, Newland has settled into the role of elder statesman, consulted on projects for the city and become involved in philanthropic work. His marriage to May was dull but dignified, and he mourns her sincerely; she had died two years before of the infectious pneumonia through which she had nursed their third child, Bill, back to health. Newland looks at May's first picture, still in its place near the inkstand, and muses that she remained unchanged -- like her photo -- until her death. Even the children hesitated to take away her ingenuous thoughts with their cold, new-century realities. The telephone rings and Newland speaks with Dallas, his architect son who is calling long distance from Chicago. Dallas' voice sounds so close it is amazing, and Newland listens as Dallas asks him to go to Europe with him on a job. Newland's son is to be married on June 5 to Fanny Beaufort, daughter of Julius and Fanny Ring, who married years ago following the death of Regina Beaufort. Times have changed and no one criticizes this union. Newland accompanies his son to Paris. All those years ago, he told Ellen he would see her in Paris, but he never kept that promise. Although he thought of himself as a dashing and romantic figure then, he now realizes he is a middle-aged relic. Ellen never went back to her husband and never married either. The Count died, leaving her a widow, living in Paris. Dallas' fiancee, Fanny, asked him to do several things, one of which was to see the Countess Olenska who had befriended her when she was in school in Europe. So Dallas tells his father he has accepted an invitation for them to call on the countess. He reveals to Newland that he knows the countess was once \\\"your Fanny.\\\" Shocked, Newland asks him why he thinks that. Dallas simply states that his dying mother told him that Newland had \\\"given up the thing most wanted\\\" and revealed her knowledge of his love for the countess. Newland is stunned to realize that his dutiful and unimaginative wife had known all along, and he is touched that she pitied him for his sacrifice. Dallas leaves to visit Versailles and Newland roams Paris, thinking of the amazing life Ellen must have had there with museums, art galleries, glittering acquaintances, and a freer world than New York City. He visits the Louvre because she probably haunted that art gallery and he thinks of himself at age 57; the sweet love of springtime is no longer possible, but perhaps they could have the mature companionship of autumn. Later that day, Newland and Dallas walk to the Invalides and pause outside Ellen's apartment. The day is fading and the view is peaceful and pleasant. Newland sits down on a bench and convinces Dallas to go up to Ellen's apartment without him, as he wants to sit a few minutes and collect his thoughts. Dallas is more like the young Newland that Ellen will remember from thirty years ago. After his son leaves, Newland imagines what that meeting will be like and realizes, \\\"It's more real to me here than if I went up.\\\" The sun slowly goes down and he stands up and walks back to his hotel.\", \"analysis\": \"Chapter 34 is especially important because it brings Wharton's story full circle and reveals the results of decisions made and promises kept. The new century is a world where both lifestyles and social values have changed considerably and Wharton knows that soon World War I will alter everything forever. She looks back on the values of her childhood New York with mixed feelings. She sees the van der Luydens' world as a place where sacrifice was necessary to promulgate the social order, but she also sees the new century where individuals have more freedom as represented by Newland and May's children. Everything about the new century is scientific and technological. The old Metropolitan Museum is now cataloguing items in a \\\"scientific\\\" way. Newland clings to his Eastlake desk despite Dallas' addition of electric lamps and more \\\"modern\\\" furniture. Traditional, colonial architecture is no longer a sign of status and wealth; it has made way for English mezzotints and Chippendale cabinets. Telephones connect people across continents and electricity lights even the night. A voyage across the Atlantic now takes only five days, and there are new-fangled hotels, motor cars, and aeroplanes. Everywhere modern products are changing the lifestyles of Americans, but these products are part of the mass-produced modern world with no deeper meaning. In many ways Wharton reveals that twentieth-century lifestyles are filled with superficial products at the expense of lives with deeper sensitivities and reserves. Even the social attitudes are changing. May would not recognize this world, nor would she feel comfortable in it. Some things are the same, like Mary's wedding at Grace Church. However, men are now able, like Dallas, to turn interests into occupations. While he inherited his father's love of art, he changed it into architecture where he could use it in a socially acceptable way. Law is no longer the only male job choice. Even Mary is not like her mother in some ways. While she has some of May's traditional values, she is a new woman in that she is more athletic and more tolerant in many areas of her life. Where May could shoot arrows, Mary can climb mountains. Dallas also represents the new generation. His class and age group is more sure, confident, and free. Newland mentions his \\\"assured step and delightful smile,\\\" useful to seal contracts with rich, new millionaires. Dallas sees Newland and May's sacrifice as prehistoric. While Newland has tried to teach his son to be more reserved, Dallas revels in a world where husbands and wives can tell each other what they think. His marriage to Fanny Beaufort, sanctioned by Janey's gift of their mother's jewelry, is a symbol of the new society's ability to find a place for those ostracized in the old order. No one remembers the Beaufort scandal anymore, and what was not acceptable in Newland's close and structured world is now permissible. Wharton brings home, with May's deathbed confession, the idea that the lives of the old wealthy in 1870s New York were totally shaped and conditioned by a context no longer as strong in the new century. Where Newland felt that leaving May for Ellen would mean the loss of \\\"habit, and honour, and all the old decencies,\\\" Dallas finds that sacrifice prehistoric. May understood that Newland could have lived no other way. The announcement of her pregnancy sealed forever his choice to leave because he was powerfully locked into a world where that would have been unthinkable. In Newland's young world, May would never have asked him to make such a sacrifice because it was understood that he would. The passions of individuals were surrendered to perpetuate the social order. Now, after World War I, Wharton looks back on that idea with mixed emotions. The New York of the 1870s did not have the social upheaval brought about by the war in Europe, and its traditional outlook from father to son, and mother to daughter, provided a stability that could be treasured, despite its cost to the individual. In many ways, this last chapter is about the passing of the torch from one generation to another amidst a realization that the old world is over. The day Newland and Ellen met at the museum among the crumbling relics and uncertain antiquities, he realized that time took away identities, cares, and concerns. Then it was just an abstract idea; now, in twentieth-century Paris, it is a reality. Children are born, christened, grow up, and leave, and parents settle into new roles and eventually die. The photo of Newland's young wife, May, is frozen in time, just as his image of Ellen will remain forever in the 1870s. Seeing himself as a \\\"grey relic of a man,\\\" Newland realizes that he holds fast to habit and prefers the world of his youth. The new world belongs to his son and those like him, less sensitive than their parents, but infinitely more free to follow their passions. Deciding to remember the exotic Ellen as a memory from his past and a symbol of his freedom from social restraints, Newland walks into the dusk in the lingering last words of the novel. Wharton suggests that only his memories of their love in that earlier time have any meaning. That love belonged to a different, more ordered time and if left alone, its memory can be cherished.

There his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to\nhim, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young\nwomen of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a\nchild; and there their eldest boy, Dallas, too delicate to be taken to\nchurch in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the Bishop\nof New York, the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop, so long the\npride and ornament of his diocese.  There Dallas had first staggered\nacross the floor shouting \"Dad,\" while May and the nurse laughed behind\nthe door; there their second child, Mary (who was so like her mother),\nhad announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of Reggie\nChivers's many sons; and there Archer had kissed her through her\nwedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them\nto Grace Church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its\nfoundations the \"Grace Church wedding\" remained an unchanged\ninstitution.\n\nIt was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future\nof the children: the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill,\nMary's incurable indifference to \"accomplishments,\" and passion for\nsport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward \"art\" which had\nfinally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a\nrising New York architect.\n\nThe young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and\nbusiness and taking up all sorts of new things.  If they were not\nabsorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that\nthey were going in for Central American archaeology, for architecture\nor landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the\nprerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting\nGeorgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word\n\"Colonial.\"  Nobody nowadays had \"Colonial\" houses except the\nmillionaire grocers of the suburbs.\n\nBut above all--sometimes Archer put it above all--it was in that\nlibrary that the Governor of New York, coming down from Albany one\nevening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said,\nbanging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses:\n\"Hang the professional politician!  You're the kind of man the country\nwants, Archer.  If the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you\nhave got to lend a hand in the cleaning.\"\n\n\"Men like you--\" how Archer had glowed at the phrase!  How eagerly he\nhad risen up at the call!  It was an echo of Ned Winsett's old appeal\nto roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man\nwho set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was\nirresistible.\n\nArcher, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself WERE what\nhis country needed, at least in the active service to which Theodore\nRoosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not,\nfor after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re-elected, and\nhad dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and\nfrom that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the\nreforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its\napathy.  It was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered\nto what the young men of his generation and his set had looked\nforward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which\ntheir vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new\nstate of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built\nwall.  He had done little in public life; he would always be by nature\na contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to\ncontemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man's friendship\nto be his strength and pride.\n\nHe had been, in short, what people were beginning to call \"a good\ncitizen.\"  In New York, for many years past, every new movement,\nphilanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion\nand wanted his name.  People said:  \"Ask Archer\" when there was a\nquestion of starting the first school for crippled children,\nreorganising the Museum of Art, founding the Grolier Club, inaugurating\nthe new Library, or getting up a new society of chamber music.  His\ndays were full, and they were filled decently.  He supposed it was all\na man ought to ask.\n\nSomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life.  But he thought of\nit now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined\nwould have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first\nprize in a lottery.  There were a hundred million tickets in HIS\nlottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too\ndecidedly against him.  When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was\nabstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a\nbook or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he\nhad missed.  That vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him\nfrom thinking of other women.  He had been what was called a faithful\nhusband; and when May had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious\npneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had\nhonestly mourned her.  Their long years together had shown him that it\ndid not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept\nthe dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of\nugly appetites.  Looking about him, he honoured his own past, and\nmourned for it.  After all, there was good in the old ways.\n\nHis eyes, making the round of the room--done over by Dallas with\nEnglish mezzotints, Chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white\nand pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old Eastlake\nwriting-table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his\nfirst photograph of May, which still kept its place beside his inkstand.\n\nThere she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin\nand flapping Leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the\nMission garden.  And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;\nnever quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous,\nfaithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of\ngrowth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt\nitself without her ever being conscious of the change.  This hard\nbright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered.\nHer incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their\nviews from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first,\na joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in\nwhich father and children had unconsciously collaborated.  And she had\ndied thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious\nhouseholds like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was\nconvinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate\nin Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his\nparents' lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her)\nwould transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.  And of Mary she was\nsure as of her own self.  So, having snatched little Bill from the\ngrave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her\nplace in the Archer vault in St.  Mark's, where Mrs. Archer already lay\nsafe from the terrifying \"trend\" which her daughter-in-law had never\neven become aware of.\n\nOpposite May's portrait stood one of her daughter.  Mary Chivers was as\ntall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and\nslightly slouching, as the altered fashion required.  Mary Chivers's\nmighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the\ntwenty-inch waist that May Archer's azure sash so easily spanned.  And\nthe difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely\ngirt as her figure.  Mary, who was no less conventional, and no more\nintelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.  There\nwas good in the new order too.\n\nThe telephone clicked, and Archer, turning from the photographs,\nunhooked the transmitter at his elbow.  How far they were from the days\nwhen the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been New York's\nonly means of quick communication!\n\n\"Chicago wants you.\"\n\nAh--it must be a long-distance from Dallas, who had been sent to\nChicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the Lakeside palace they\nwere to build for a young millionaire with ideas.  The firm always sent\nDallas on such errands.\n\n\"Hallo, Dad--Yes: Dallas.  I say--how do you feel about sailing on\nWednesday?  Mauretania: Yes, next Wednesday as ever is.  Our client\nwants me to look at some Italian gardens before we settle anything, and\nhas asked me to nip over on the next boat.  I've got to be back on the\nfirst of June--\" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--\"so we\nmust look alive.  I say, Dad, I want your help: do come.\"\n\nDallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and\nnatural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the\nfire.  The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer, for\nlong-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as\nelectric lighting and five-day Atlantic voyages.  But the laugh did\nstartle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and\nmiles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and\nbusy indifferent millions--Dallas's laugh should be able to say: \"Of\ncourse, whatever happens, I must get back on the first, because Fanny\nBeaufort and I are to be married on the fifth.\"\n\nThe voice began again:  \"Think it over?  No, sir: not a minute.  You've\ngot to say yes now.  Why not, I'd like to know?  If you can allege a\nsingle reason--No; I knew it.  Then it's a go, eh?  Because I count on\nyou to ring up the Cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you'd better\nbook a return on a boat from Marseilles.  I say, Dad; it'll be our last\ntime together, in this kind of way--.  Oh, good!  I knew you would.\"\n\nChicago rang off, and Archer rose and began to pace up and down the\nroom.\n\nIt would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was\nright.  They would have lots of other \"times\" after Dallas's marriage,\nhis father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and Fanny\nBeaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to\ninterfere with their intimacy.  On the contrary, from what he had seen\nof her, he thought she would be naturally included in it.  Still,\nchange was change, and differences were differences, and much as he\nfelt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting\nto seize this last chance of being alone with his boy.\n\nThere was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one\nthat he had lost the habit of travel.  May had disliked to move except\nfor valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the\nmountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in\nThirty-ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands' in\nNewport.  After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty\nto travel for six months; and the whole family had made the\nold-fashioned tour through England, Switzerland and Italy.  Their time\nbeing limited (no one knew why) they had omitted France.  Archer\nremembered Dallas's wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc\ninstead of Rheims and Chartres.  But Mary and Bill wanted\nmountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in Dallas's wake\nthrough the English cathedrals; and May, always fair to her children,\nhad insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and\nartistic proclivities.  She had indeed proposed that her husband should\ngo to Paris for a fortnight, and join them on the Italian lakes after\nthey had \"done\" Switzerland; but Archer had declined.  \"We'll stick\ntogether,\" he said; and May's face had brightened at his setting such a\ngood example to Dallas.\n\nSince her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for\nhis continuing in the same routine.  His children had urged him to\ntravel: Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad\nand \"see the galleries.\"  The very mysteriousness of such a cure made\nher the more confident of its efficacy.  But Archer had found himself\nheld fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from\nnew things.\n\nNow, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk.\nThe worst of doing one's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for\ndoing anything else.  At least that was the view that the men of his\ngeneration had taken.  The trenchant divisions between right and wrong,\nhonest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little\nscope for the unforeseen.  There are moments when a man's imagination,\nso easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily\nlevel, and surveys the long windings of destiny.  Archer hung there and\nwondered....\n\nWhat was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose\nstandards had bent and bound him?  He remembered a sneering prophecy of\npoor Lawrence Lefferts's, uttered years ago in that very room:  \"If\nthings go on at this rate, our children will be marrying Beaufort's\nbastards.\"\n\nIt was just what Archer's eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing;\nand nobody wondered or reproved.  Even the boy's Aunt Janey, who still\nlooked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her\nmother's emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and\ncarried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and\nFanny Beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a\n\"set\" from a Paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned\nbeauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an\nIsabey miniature.\n\nFanny Beaufort, who had appeared in New York at eighteen, after the\ndeath of her parents, had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won\nit thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid\nof her, society took her joyfully for granted.  She was pretty, amusing\nand accomplished: what more did any one want?  Nobody was narrow-minded\nenough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father's\npast and her own origin.  Only the older people remembered so obscure\nan incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort's failure, or\nthe fact that after his wife's death he had been quietly married to the\nnotorious Fanny Ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a\nlittle girl who inherited her beauty.  He was subsequently heard of in\nConstantinople, then in Russia; and a dozen years later American\ntravellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres, where he\nrepresented a large insurance agency.  He and his wife died there in\nthe odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had\nappeared in New York in charge of May Archer's sister-in-law, Mrs. Jack\nWelland, whose husband had been appointed the girl's guardian.  The\nfact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer's\nchildren, and nobody was surprised when Dallas's engagement was\nannounced.\n\nNothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the\nworld had travelled.  People nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms\nand \"movements,\" with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much\nabout their neighbours.  And of what account was anybody's past, in the\nhuge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same\nplane?\n\nNewland Archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety\nof the Paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and\neagerness of youth.\n\nIt was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening\nwaistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot\ntemples.  He wondered if it was thus that his son's conducted itself in\nthe presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort--and decided that it was not.  \"It\nfunctions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different,\" he\nreflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had\nannounced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would\napprove.\n\n\"The difference is that these young people take it for granted that\nthey're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took\nit for granted that we shouldn't.  Only, I wonder--the thing one's so\ncertain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?\"\n\nIt was the day after their arrival in Paris, and the spring sunshine\nheld Archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the\nPlace Vendome.  One of the things he had stipulated--almost the only\none--when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas, was that, in Paris,\nhe shouldn't be made to go to one of the newfangled \"palaces.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right--of course,\" Dallas good-naturedly agreed.  \"I'll take\nyou to some jolly old-fashioned place--the Bristol say--\" leaving his\nfather speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and\nemperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for\nits quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour.\n\nArcher had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the\nscene of his return to Paris; then the personal vision had faded, and\nhe had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska's\nlife.  Sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had\ngone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the\navenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public\ngardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll\nof the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and\npleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting.  Now the spectacle\nwas before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy,\nold-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the\nruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being....\n\nDallas's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder.  \"Hullo, father: this\nis something like, isn't it?\"  They stood for a while looking out in\nsilence, and then the young man continued:  \"By the way, I've got a\nmessage for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half-past\nfive.\"\n\nHe said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual\nitem of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave\nfor Florence the next evening.  Archer looked at him, and thought he\nsaw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother Mingott's\nmalice.\n\n\"Oh, didn't I tell you?\" Dallas pursued.  \"Fanny made me swear to do\nthree things while I was in Paris: get her the score of the last\nDebussy songs, go to the Grand-Guignol and see Madame Olenska.  You\nknow she was awfully good to Fanny when Mr. Beaufort sent her over from\nBuenos Ayres to the Assomption.  Fanny hadn't any friends in Paris, and\nMadame Olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays.\nI believe she was a great friend of the first Mrs. Beaufort's.  And\nshe's our cousin, of course.  So I rang her up this morning, before I\nwent out, and told her you and I were here for two days and wanted to\nsee her.\"\n\nArcher continued to stare at him.  \"You told her I was here?\"\n\n\"Of course--why not?\"  Dallas's eye brows went up whimsically.  Then,\ngetting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father's with a\nconfidential pressure.\n\n\"I say, father: what was she like?\"\n\nArcher felt his colour rise under his son's unabashed gaze.  \"Come, own\nup: you and she were great pals, weren't you?  Wasn't she most awfully\nlovely?\"\n\n\"Lovely?  I don't know.  She was different.\"\n\n\"Ah--there you have it!  That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?\nWhen she comes, SHE'S DIFFERENT--and one doesn't know why.  It's\nexactly what I feel about Fanny.\"\n\nHis father drew back a step, releasing his arm.  \"About Fanny?  But, my\ndear fellow--I should hope so!  Only I don't see--\"\n\n\"Dash it, Dad, don't be prehistoric!  Wasn't she--once--your Fanny?\"\n\nDallas belonged body and soul to the new generation.  He was the\nfirst-born of Newland and May Archer, yet it had never been possible to\ninculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve.  \"What's the use of\nmaking mysteries?  It only makes people want to nose 'em out,\" he\nalways objected when enjoined to discretion.  But Archer, meeting his\neyes, saw the filial light under their banter.\n\n\"My Fanny?\"\n\n\"Well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't,\"\ncontinued his surprising son.\n\n\"I didn't,\" echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity.\n\n\"No: you date, you see, dear old boy.  But mother said--\"\n\n\"Your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes: the day before she died.  It was when she sent for me alone--you\nremember?  She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would\nbe, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you\nmost wanted.\"\n\nArcher received this strange communication in silence.  His eyes\nremained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the\nwindow.  At length he said in a low voice:  \"She never asked me.\"\n\n\"No.  I forgot.  You never did ask each other anything, did you?  And\nyou never told each other anything.  You just sat and watched each\nother, and guessed at what was going on underneath.  A deaf-and-dumb\nasylum, in fact!  Well, I back your generation for knowing more about\neach other's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about\nour own.--I say, Dad,\" Dallas broke off, \"you're not angry with me?  If\nyou are, let's make it up and go and lunch at Henri's.  I've got to\nrush out to Versailles afterward.\"\n\nArcher did not accompany his son to Versailles.  He preferred to spend\nthe afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris.  He had to deal all\nat once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate\nlifetime.\n\nAfter a little while he did not regret Dallas's indiscretion.  It\nseemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all,\nsome one had guessed and pitied....  And that it should have been his\nwife moved him indescribably.  Dallas, for all his affectionate\ninsight, would not have understood that.  To the boy, no doubt, the\nepisode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted\nforces.  But was it really no more?  For a long time Archer sat on a\nbench in the Champs Elysees and wondered, while the stream of life\nrolled by....\n\nA few streets away, a few hours away, Ellen Olenska waited.  She had\nnever gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years\nbefore, she had made no change in her way of living.  There was nothing\nnow to keep her and Archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her.\n\nHe got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries\ngardens to the Louvre.  She had once told him that she often went\nthere, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place\nwhere he could think of her as perhaps having lately been.  For an hour\nor more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of\nafternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their\nhalf-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of\nbeauty.  After all, his life had been too starved....\n\nSuddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying:  \"But\nI'm only fifty-seven--\" and then he turned away.  For such summer\ndreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of\nfriendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.\n\nHe went back to the hotel, where he and Dallas were to meet; and\ntogether they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the\nbridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nDallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father's mind, was\ntalking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles.  He had had but one\nprevious glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to\npack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with\nthe family to Switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure\ncriticism tripped each other up on his lips.\n\nAs Archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness\nincreased.  The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the\nfacility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a\nmaster but as an equal.  \"That's it: they feel equal to things--they\nknow their way about,\" he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman\nof the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and\nwith them the sign-posts and the danger-signal.\n\nSuddenly Dallas stopped short, grasping his father's arm.  \"Oh, by\nJove,\" he exclaimed.\n\nThey had come out into the great tree-planted space before the\nInvalides.  The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding\ntrees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself\nall the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol\nof the race's glory.\n\nArcher knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the\navenues radiating from the Invalides; and he had pictured the quarter\nas quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit\nit up.  Now, by some queer process of association, that golden light\nbecame for him the pervading illumination in which she lived.  For\nnearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely\nlittle--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to\nbe too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs.  He thought of the\ntheatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at,\nthe sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people\nshe must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities,\nimages and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a\nsetting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young\nFrenchman who had once said to him:  \"Ah, good conversation--there is\nnothing like it, is there?\"\n\nArcher had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty\nyears; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame\nOlenska's existence.  More than half a lifetime divided them, and she\nhad spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society\nhe but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly\nunderstand.  During that time he had been living with his youthful\nmemory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible\ncompanionship.  Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something\napart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim\nchapel, where there was not time to pray every day....\n\nThey had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of\nthe thoroughfares flanking the building.  It was a quiet quarter, after\nall, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one\nan idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this\nwere left to the few and the indifferent.\n\nThe day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by\na yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square\ninto which they had turned.  Dallas stopped again, and looked up.\n\n\"It must be here,\" he said, slipping his arm through his father's with\na movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood\ntogether looking up at the house.\n\nIt was a modern building, without distinctive character, but\nmany-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured\nfront.  On one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the\nrounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were\nstill lowered, as though the sun had just left it.\n\n\"I wonder which floor--?\" Dallas conjectured; and moving toward the\nporte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to\nsay:  \"The fifth.  It must be the one with the awnings.\"\n\nArcher remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end\nof their pilgrimage had been attained.\n\n\"I say, you know, it's nearly six,\" his son at length reminded him.\n\nThe father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees.\n\n\"I believe I'll sit there a moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Why--aren't you well?\" his son exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, perfectly.  But I should like you, please, to go up without me.\"\n\nDallas paused before him, visibly bewildered.  \"But, I say, Dad: do you\nmean you won't come up at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Archer slowly.\n\n\"If you don't she won't understand.\"\n\n\"Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you.\"\n\nDallas gave him a long look through the twilight.\n\n\"But what on earth shall I say?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?\" his father\nrejoined with a smile.\n\n\"Very well.  I shall say you're old-fashioned, and prefer walking up\nthe five flights because you don't like lifts.\"\n\nHis father smiled again.  \"Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough.\"\n\nDallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture,\npassed out of sight under the vaulted doorway.\n\nArcher sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged\nbalcony.  He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up\nin the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to\nthe hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  He pictured Dallas\nentering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful\nsmile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy\n\"took after him.\"\n\nThen he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at\nthat sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark\nlady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out\na long thin hand with three rings on it....  He thought she would be\nsitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her\non a table.\n\n\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard\nhimself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose\nits edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each\nother.\n\nHe sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes\nnever turning from the balcony.  At length a light shone through the\nwindows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew\nup the awnings, and closed the shutters.\n\nAt that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got\nup slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.\n\n\n\n\nA Note on the Text\n\nThe Age of Innocence first appeared in four large installments in The\nPictorial Review, from July to October 1920.

He is in a reflective mood, brought about by his memories of meeting the Countess there years ago. In his library he remembers May announcing her pregnancy; their delicate son, Dallas, being christened and later taking his first steps; their daughter, Mary, becoming engaged to one of Reggie Chivers' dull sons and her radiant face as Newland kissed her here on her wedding day; and his conversations with Theodore Roosevelt, a family friend, who stayed overnight. Roosevelt talked Newland into running for public office, as Ned Winsett had often urged him to do. Spending only one term in the State Assembly, Newland has settled into the role of elder statesman, consulted on projects for the city and become involved in philanthropic work. His marriage to May was dull but dignified, and he mourns her sincerely; she had died two years before of the infectious pneumonia through which she had nursed their third child, Bill, back to health. Newland looks at May's first picture, still in its place near the inkstand, and muses that she remained unchanged -- like her photo -- until her death. Even the children hesitated to take away her ingenuous thoughts with their cold, new-century realities. The telephone rings and Newland speaks with Dallas, his architect son who is calling long distance from Chicago. Dallas' voice sounds so close it is amazing, and Newland listens as Dallas asks him to go to Europe with him on a job. Newland's son is to be married on June 5 to Fanny Beaufort, daughter of Julius and Fanny Ring, who married years ago following the death of Regina Beaufort. Times have changed and no one criticizes this union. Newland accompanies his son to Paris. All those years ago, he told Ellen he would see her in Paris, but he never kept that promise. Although he thought of himself as a dashing and romantic figure then, he now realizes he is a middle-aged relic. Ellen never went back to her husband and never married either. The Count died, leaving her a widow, living in Paris. Dallas' fiancee, Fanny, asked him to do several things, one of which was to see the Countess Olenska who had befriended her when she was in school in Europe. So Dallas tells his father he has accepted an invitation for them to call on the countess. He reveals to Newland that he knows the countess was once \"your Fanny.\" Shocked, Newland asks him why he thinks that. Dallas simply states that his dying mother told him that Newland had \"given up the thing most wanted\" and revealed her knowledge of his love for the countess. Newland is stunned to realize that his dutiful and unimaginative wife had known all along, and he is touched that she pitied him for his sacrifice. Dallas leaves to visit Versailles and Newland roams Paris, thinking of the amazing life Ellen must have had there with museums, art galleries, glittering acquaintances, and a freer world than New York City. He visits the Louvre because she probably haunted that art gallery and he thinks of himself at age 57; the sweet love of springtime is no longer possible, but perhaps they could have the mature companionship of autumn. Later that day, Newland and Dallas walk to the Invalides and pause outside Ellen's apartment. The day is fading and the view is peaceful and pleasant. Newland sits down on a bench and convinces Dallas to go up to Ellen's apartment without him, as he wants to sit a few minutes and collect his thoughts. Dallas is more like the young Newland that Ellen will remember from thirty years ago. After his son leaves, Newland imagines what that meeting will be like and realizes, \"It's more real to me here than if I went up.\" The sun slowly goes down and he stands up and walks back to his hotel.","summary_analysis":"Chapter 34 is especially important because it brings Wharton's story full circle and reveals the results of decisions made and promises kept. The new century is a world where both lifestyles and social values have changed considerably and Wharton knows that soon World War I will alter everything forever. She looks back on the values of her childhood New York with mixed feelings. She sees the van der Luydens' world as a place where sacrifice was necessary to promulgate the social order, but she also sees the new century where individuals have more freedom as represented by Newland and May's children. Everything about the new century is scientific and technological. The old Metropolitan Museum is now cataloguing items in a \"scientific\" way. Newland clings to his Eastlake desk despite Dallas' addition of electric lamps and more \"modern\" furniture. Traditional, colonial architecture is no longer a sign of status and wealth; it has made way for English mezzotints and Chippendale cabinets. Telephones connect people across continents and electricity lights even the night. A voyage across the Atlantic now takes only five days, and there are new-fangled hotels, motor cars, and aeroplanes. Everywhere modern products are changing the lifestyles of Americans, but these products are part of the mass-produced modern world with no deeper meaning. In many ways Wharton reveals that twentieth-century lifestyles are filled with superficial products at the expense of lives with deeper sensitivities and reserves. Even the social attitudes are changing. May would not recognize this world, nor would she feel comfortable in it. Some things are the same, like Mary's wedding at Grace Church. However, men are now able, like Dallas, to turn interests into occupations. While he inherited his father's love of art, he changed it into architecture where he could use it in a socially acceptable way. Law is no longer the only male job choice. Even Mary is not like her mother in some ways. While she has some of May's traditional values, she is a new woman in that she is more athletic and more tolerant in many areas of her life. Where May could shoot arrows, Mary can climb mountains. Dallas also represents the new generation. His class and age group is more sure, confident, and free. Newland mentions his \"assured step and delightful smile,\" useful to seal contracts with rich, new millionaires. Dallas sees Newland and May's sacrifice as prehistoric. While Newland has tried to teach his son to be more reserved, Dallas revels in a world where husbands and wives can tell each other what they think. His marriage to Fanny Beaufort, sanctioned by Janey's gift of their mother's jewelry, is a symbol of the new society's ability to find a place for those ostracized in the old order. No one remembers the Beaufort scandal anymore, and what was not acceptable in Newland's close and structured world is now permissible. Wharton brings home, with May's deathbed confession, the idea that the lives of the old wealthy in 1870s New York were totally shaped and conditioned by a context no longer as strong in the new century. Where Newland felt that leaving May for Ellen would mean the loss of \"habit, and honour, and all the old decencies,\" Dallas finds that sacrifice prehistoric. May understood that Newland could have lived no other way. The announcement of her pregnancy sealed forever his choice to leave because he was powerfully locked into a world where that would have been unthinkable. In Newland's young world, May would never have asked him to make such a sacrifice because it was understood that he would. The passions of individuals were surrendered to perpetuate the social order. Now, after World War I, Wharton looks back on that idea with mixed emotions. The New York of the 1870s did not have the social upheaval brought about by the war in Europe, and its traditional outlook from father to son, and mother to daughter, provided a stability that could be treasured, despite its cost to the individual. In many ways, this last chapter is about the passing of the torch from one generation to another amidst a realization that the old world is over. The day Newland and Ellen met at the museum among the crumbling relics and uncertain antiquities, he realized that time took away identities, cares, and concerns. Then it was just an abstract idea; now, in twentieth-century Paris, it is a reality. Children are born, christened, grow up, and leave, and parents settle into new roles and eventually die. The photo of Newland's young wife, May, is frozen in time, just as his image of Ellen will remain forever in the 1870s. Seeing himself as a \"grey relic of a man,\" Newland realizes that he holds fast to habit and prefers the world of his youth. The new world belongs to his son and those like him, less sensitive than their parents, but infinitely more free to follow their passions. Deciding to remember the exotic Ellen as a memory from his past and a symbol of his freedom from social restraints, Newland walks into the dusk in the lingering last words of the novel. Wharton suggests that only his memories of their love in that earlier time have any meaning. That love belonged to a different, more ordered time and if left alone, its memory can be cherished.

The party will be in honor of Ellen Olenska leaving New York and returning to Europe. Although Ellen had not spoken to Newland in ten days, he returned a key that he had given her earlier in a blank envelope. Newland is assigned the job of evaluating Ellen1s trust. All the while that he is taking care of her finances, he think that there will be an affair between the two in the future. His belief in the future keeps him from writing her. The night of the dinner party Ellen looks pale, \"lusterless and almost ugly. But still, Newland had never loved her face as much as he did at that moment. Newland notices that Ellen1s hand is ungloved. Newland thinks, \"If it were only to see her hand again I should have to follow her \" Normally only \"foreign visitors\" would be important enough to sit at the hosts left and take the place of Mrs. van der Luyden. But, they make an exception and let Ellen sit to the host1s left because, \"There were certain things that had to be done, and If done at all, done handsomely and thoroughly; and one of these in the old New York code, was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe. Newland realizes that everyone thinks that a true \"affair\" had been going on between Newland and Ellen; the celebration is really because the \"separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved. It was the New York way to take a life without any traces of blood. Everyone sits at the table discussing travel in a dispassionate way. Newland looks at Ellen; he imagines she is thinking, \"Let1s see it through,\" which means, let1s have our affair as planned. All the men retire to the library after dinner, and discuss how their society is changing. Larry Lefferts says, \"If things go on at this pace we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers1 houses and marrying Beaufort1s bastards. Later that evening, May asks if it is alright if they have a talk. Newland tries to tell her that he is tired of life and wants to go on a long trip; May says, that he can1t go because she found out today that she is pregnant. Newland has a \"sick stare\" and asks who she has told. She says that she1s told Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Welland and. Ellen. She had told Ellen about it two weeks ago. Newland asks her why she would tell Ellen about her pregnancy if she was not sure about it until today. She says, \"I wasn1t sure then, but I told her I was.","About ten days after Ellen's departure for Washington, DC, May decides to hold a farewell dinner for Ellen. A day after Ellen had departed, Mr. Letterblair had discussed with Archer some arrangements Mrs. Manson Mingott had made to set up a trust for Ellen with sufficient funds so that she could live independently in Paris. Ellen will live with Marchioness Manson. On the evening of the dinner party, everyone arrives, including the van der Luydens, the Lefferts, the Selfridge Merrys, etc. Finally, Madame Olenska arrives but she and Archer don't have much of a chance to talk alone. Archer has a few polite words with Madame Olenska at dinner, and then he asks Reggie Chivers very loudly whether Chivers would like to travel the world with him. Chivers isn't into the idea, but Mr. Selfridge Merry uses this comment as an opportunity to talk about his adventures traveling the world. Later, in the library, Lefferts goes on about how vulgar the Beauforts are. Then the gentlemen join the women in the drawing room, where Archer is struck by how impossible the women have made it for him to talk with Madame Olenska. As Madame Olenska exits, Archer helps her on with her cloak and thinks he might have a few words alone with her. But Mrs. van der Luyden swoops in and says that Madame Olenska is going home with them. As the guests leave, Lefferts asks Archer to cover for him the next time, presumably so that Lefferts can have an affair with a typist. Later, Archer sits alone in the library when May comes in, wanting to talk about how wonderful the dinner party was. Archer tells May that he would like to travel, preferably someplace distant such as India or Japan. May says that would be quite impossible since she is pregnant. She doesn't say so explicitly, but it is understood between them. Archer is unpleasantly surprised. May says she knew she was pregnant since that morning, when she had told both her mother and his. She also tells Archer that she told Ellen when they had their conversation a couple weeks ago. Archer asks her how she could have, if she had only been certain of her pregnancy that morning. May admits that she wasn't sure, but she told Ellen anyway. It turns out she was right.","Newland's plan is to speak to Ellen, find out what train she will take to Washington, join her, and run away with her to Japan. He will leave a note for May. However, he drops this plan with relief when he learns from Mrs. Mingott that Ellen will be staying with her. On his walk home, he sees Ellen leaving the Beaufort house and stops to speak with her. Unfortunately, Lawrence Lefferts and young Chivers are passing and see them. Newland winces at their discovery and wonders how he and Ellen can live such a covert existence. He pleads with Ellen to meet him alone at the Metropolitan Museum the next day, but she appears to dislike this idea. Despite his earlier theoretical championship of Ellen's freedom as a single woman, his next words indicate his real feelings because after she leaves he says, almost contemptuously, \"she'll come!\" The following day, they meet at the museum amidst the wreckage of earlier civilizations. Discussing their future, she explains that her stay with her grandmother is to keep them from \"doing irreparable harm\" to those who love them. However, she reluctantly gives in to Newland's pressure; she agrees to a future brief sexual encounter, after which she is determined go back to Europe. He feels this intimacy will give him the power to pressure her into staying. Then Newland goes home to May who greets him with the news that she saw Ellen at Mrs. Mingott's and they had \"a really good talk.\" She feels she has misjudged Ellen. The following evening, the van der Luydens attend a small dinner at Mrs. Archer's home before going to the opera. Sillerton Jackson, Newland, and May are also there. They discuss Ellen at some length and disapprove of her taking Mrs. Mingott's carriage to the Beaufort's house. After dinner they attend the opera and Newland recalls that it was the same opera they saw the night he met Ellen. May is wearing her made-over wedding dress and she looks the same after two years except for her paleness. He remembers her saying that she could not have her happiness made out of a wrong to someone else. Deciding to confess all and ask for his freedom, Newland pleads a headache and they go home. At home they settle into the library, but before he can confess, May reveals that Mrs. Manson Mingott has given Ellen an allowance and she is going back to Europe. May had received a letter from Ellen that very afternoon saying that it would be useless for her friends to urge her to change her mind. Cryptically, May adds, \"I think she understands everything,\" and goes to bed. Newland is dumbfounded. Newland later meets with Mrs. Mingott and when he returns home that evening, May announces a going-away dinner for Ellen. She is very assertive when Newland questions her reasons, and she explains that her mother agrees it is the thing to do. The farewell dinner will be their first big dinner since their marriage. It has been 10 days since Newland saw Ellen and he muses that she will return to Europe and he will follow. The night of the dinner arrives and when all are assembled Ellen appears, pale and \"lusterless.\" Every glance at her reminds Newland of memories of his love. Now that Ellen is leaving, the Mingotts and Wellands express their affection for her; it is obvious to Newland that this is \"a tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.\" Suddenly, Newland realizes that the entire family believes he and Ellen are lovers and they are separating them in the most civilized manner possible. Throughout the evening, Newland and Ellen exchange pleasantries, aware that all eyes are on them. The gentlemen retire to their cigars. Lefferts expounds on the decline of values in New York society, and eventually the men return to the drawing room and \"May's triumphant eyes.\" Newland realizes she shares the belief that he and Ellen are lovers. May kisses Ellen's cheek, vanquishing the foe, and Newland accompanies Ellen to the hall, putting her cloak on her shoulders. When he thinks they might be alone for a moment, the van der Luydens appear and announce they are driving Ellen. He tells her that he will see her soon in Paris, and she correctly says it would be nice if he and May could come. Then she is gone. The dinner is over and Newland and May are in the library. Newland starts to confess once again, but says instead that he needs to go on a long trip because he is very tired. May explains that the doctor might not let her go along, and she reveals that she has already told both her mother and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. It dawns on Newland that the conversation she had with Ellen two weeks earlier was about her pregnancy. She watches Newland intently as she asks if he minds. In questioning her, he finds that she told Ellen this news long before she was sure."],"next summary id":"chapter xxxiv","next chapter":"Twenty-six years later in a new century, Newland Archer, age 57, is sitting in his library on East 39th Street, having just returned from a ceremony for new galleries in the Metropolitan Museum.

May tells Archer that she wishes to give her first formal dinner in honor of the departure of Countess Olenska. At the dinner, Archer notices that the guests are remarkably kind to Ellen now that she is about to leave. With a start, he realizes that the entire clan assumes that he has been having an affair with Ellen for quite some time. Although the guests are too polite to even allude to the affair, their elaborately feigned innocence is, to Archer, the surest sign that they suspect an infidelity. Suddenly, the dinner seems to be the disguise for a celebratory send-off of a member of the clan who has violated their strict social code. After dinner, Archer gathers with the other gentlemen in his library. Archer is disgusted by the hypocrisy of Larry Lefferts, who self-righteously condemns Beaufort's infidelities despite his own illicit affairs. The guests finally leave, after paying their warmest respects to Ellen. Alone in his library, Archer and May discuss the success of the evening. Archer has again resolved to tell May of his feelings for Ellen, when she reveals to him that she is pregnant. She tells him that she wasn't positive until that morning, but that she had told Ellen in their long conversation two weeks earlier the she was pregnant. It is now twenty-five years later, and the world has changed significantly. Archer is now considered to be a model citizen, a philanthropist, and a dutiful father. We learn that May had died from pneumonia two years earlier, after nursing their youngest child back to health. Archer had remained a dutiful husband throughout the rest of their marriage, and May died no less innocent of the world than at her youth. The memory of Ellen Olenska has kept Archer from pursuing other women. At fifty-seven, he finds himself less adventurous, more inclined to old habits than in his youth, and he is bewildered by the new social freedoms available for his grown children. Archer's eldest son convinces him to accompany him to Paris for a few weeks. Once there, he surprises Archer by informing him that they are to visit the Countess Olenska at her Paris apartment. Archer's son asks him if it was true that he had once been in love with the Countess. The son continues by remarking that May had told him the day before she died that Archer had \\\"given up the thing he most wanted\\\" when she had asked him to. Emotionally, Archer responds that she had never asked him. That afternoon, Archer does not join his son in calling on Ellen Olenska. Down on the street below her apartment, he visualizes entering her apartment. He decides that she is more real to him in his imagination than if he went up. As Archer stares up at the apartment balcony, a manservant appears at the window and closes the shutters. As if his cue, Archer returns alone to his hotel.\", \"analysis\": \"The scene of the Archers' dinner party is one of the most ironic moments in the novel. As Archer sits surrounded by his family and friends, it dawns on him as to why they are acting so cordially toward Ellen. She is leaving them permanently. Now that they are certain that she will no longer threaten their stable little society, they are willing to give her a celebratory send-off. Just as suddenly, Archer realizes why they are so eager for her to leave: they assume that he and Ellen have been having an affair for months. It is unbearably ironic to Archer that they are convinced that he has been enjoying an affair when in reality this is the very thing he has not been able to attain. His situation is contrasted by that of Larry Lefferts, who, as he leaves, asks Archer to cover for him so he can meet with his own mistress the next night. That Lefferts's real adulteries can remain hidden under a veneer of manners and pious exclamations while Archer's supposed affair leaves him vulnerable to judgment increases the scene's sense of irony. Between Chapter 33 and 34, there is an enormous chronological gap of about twenty-six years. By abruptly switching to the turn of the century without showing any development of plot or characters, Wharton indicates the discontinuity of the past with the present. By the time Archer reaches middle- age, the world around him has changed dramatically. His children have less leisure time but more freedom and more opportunities than he ever had. The world of his youth is now considered old-fashioned, even a little obsolete. This perhaps explains why Archer's life with May after the announcement of her pregnancy is told as if it were a history. Even though his life with her is important in explaining his current circumstances, May remains only as a memory of the irretrievable past. What about Ellen? Is she, too, relegated to the past, to remain a hazy image in Archer's memory? It has been many years since he last saw her at May's dinner party, and he cannot imagine how she must have changed from the young woman he remembers. He wonders, in turn, what Ellen remembers of him, whether or not he only remains in her memory \\\"like a relic in a small dim chapel.\\\" In Paris, Archer is faced with the rather bewildering prospect of seeing her once again. Standing on the street below her apartment, he sees how different her life must have become in the last twenty-six years. He wonders how the present reality and his own idealized memories of Ellen can possibly connect. In the end Archer chooses to be left with the memory of Ellen and not Ellen herself. Not seeing the real--and now significantly older--person allows him, in certain respects, to maintain her as a symbolic presence, an emblem of the wistfulness and regrets of his youth. This quiet wistful ending is not what the reader expects. It is neither tragic nor happy. Nor is it inevitable. There is now nothing stopping Archer from reuniting with Ellen; he is only in his fifties, he has been widowed, and he is living in a new and liberal age. If Wharton had chosen to have the two characters meet again, there could be two possible outcomes. Either they would passionately reunite, or they would realize that they had changed too much in their time apart. But Wharton does not allow us to see either possibility. By departing from a traditional happy or tragic ending, she frustrates her readers' expectations. As with Archer's and Ellen's unconsummated affair, Wharton leaves the plot incomplete rather than giving it a predictable ending.\"}","chapter":"\nIt was, as Mrs. Archer smilingly said to Mrs. Welland, a great event\nfor a young couple to give their first big dinner.\n\nThe Newland Archers, since they had set up their household, had\nreceived a good deal of company in an informal way.  Archer was fond of\nhaving three or four friends to dine, and May welcomed them with the\nbeaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in\nconjugal affairs.  Her husband questioned whether, if left to herself,\nshe would ever have asked any one to the house; but he had long given\nup trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which\ntradition and training had moulded her.  It was expected that well-off\nyoung couples in New York should do a good deal of informal\nentertaining, and a Welland married to an Archer was doubly pledged to\nthe tradition.\n\nBut a big dinner, with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen, with\nRoman punch, roses from Henderson's, and menus on gilt-edged cards, was\na different affair, and not to be lightly undertaken.  As Mrs. Archer\nremarked, the Roman punch made all the difference; not in itself but by\nits manifold implications--since it signified either canvas-backs or\nterrapin, two soups, a hot and a cold sweet, full decolletage with\nshort sleeves, and guests of a proportionate importance.\n\nIt was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their\nfirst invitations in the third person, and their summons was seldom\nrefused even by the seasoned and sought-after.  Still, it was\nadmittedly a triumph that the van der Luydens, at May's request, should\nhave stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the\nCountess Olenska.\n\nThe two mothers-in-law sat in May's drawing-room on the afternoon of\nthe great day, Mrs. Archer writing out the menus on Tiffany's thickest\ngilt-edged bristol, while Mrs. Welland superintended the placing of the\npalms and standard lamps.\n\nArcher, arriving late from his office, found them still there.  Mrs.\nArcher had turned her attention to the name-cards for the table, and\nMrs. Welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large\ngilt sofa, so that another \"corner\" might be created between the piano\nand the window.\n\nMay, they told him, was in the dining-room inspecting the mound of\nJacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table, and\nthe placing of the Maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between\nthe candelabra.  On the piano stood a large basket of orchids which Mr.\nvan der Luyden had had sent from Skuytercliff.  Everything was, in\nshort, as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event.\n\nMrs. Archer ran thoughtfully over the list, checking off each name with\nher sharp gold pen.\n\n\"Henry van der Luyden--Louisa--the Lovell Mingotts--the Reggie\nChiverses--Lawrence Lefferts and Gertrude--(yes, I suppose May was\nright to have them)--the Selfridge Merrys, Sillerton Jackson, Van\nNewland and his wife. (How time passes!  It seems only yesterday that\nhe was your best man, Newland)--and Countess Olenska--yes, I think\nthat's all....\"\n\nMrs. Welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately.  \"No one can say,\nNewland, that you and May are not giving Ellen a handsome send-off.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" said Mrs. Archer, \"I understand May's wanting her cousin to\ntell people abroad that we're not quite barbarians.\"\n\n\"I'm sure Ellen will appreciate it.  She was to arrive this morning, I\nbelieve.  It will make a most charming last impression.  The evening\nbefore sailing is usually so dreary,\" Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued.\n\nArcher turned toward the door, and his mother-in-law called to him:\n\"Do go in and have a peep at the table.  And don't let May tire herself\ntoo much.\"  But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to\nhis library.  The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed\ninto a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly\n\"tidied,\" and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and\ncedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" he thought, \"it's not for long--\" and he went on to his\ndressing-room.\n\nTen days had passed since Madame Olenska's departure from New York.\nDuring those ten days Archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed\nby the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper, and sent to his office\nin a sealed envelope addressed in her hand.  This retort to his last\nappeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar\ngame; but the young man chose to give it a different meaning.  She was\nstill fighting against her fate; but she was going to Europe, and she\nwas not returning to her husband.  Nothing, therefore, was to prevent\nhis following her; and once he had taken the irrevocable step, and had\nproved to her that it was irrevocable, he believed she would not send\nhim away.\n\nThis confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the\npresent.  It had kept him from writing to her, or betraying, by any\nsign or act, his misery and mortification.  It seemed to him that in\nthe deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands;\nand he waited.\n\nThere had been, nevertheless, moments sufficiently difficult to pass;\nas when Mr. Letterblair, the day after Madame Olenska's departure, had\nsent for him to go over the details of the trust which Mrs. Manson\nMingott wished to create for her granddaughter.  For a couple of hours\nArcher had examined the terms of the deed with his senior, all the\nwhile obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some\nreason other than the obvious one of his cousinship; and that the close\nof the conference would reveal it.\n\n\"Well, the lady can't deny that it's a handsome arrangement,\" Mr.\nLetterblair had summed up, after mumbling over a summary of the\nsettlement.  \"In fact I'm bound to say she's been treated pretty\nhandsomely all round.\"\n\n\"All round?\" Archer echoed with a touch of derision.  \"Do you refer to\nher husband's proposal to give her back her own money?\"\n\nMr. Letterblair's bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch.  \"My\ndear sir, the law's the law; and your wife's cousin was married under\nthe French law.  It's to be presumed she knew what that meant.\"\n\n\"Even if she did, what happened subsequently--.\"  But Archer paused.\nMr. Letterblair had laid his pen-handle against his big corrugated\nnose, and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous\nelderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that\nvirtue is not synonymous with ignorance.\n\n\"My dear sir, I've no wish to extenuate the Count's transgressions;\nbut--but on the other side ... I wouldn't put my hand in the fire ...\nwell, that there hadn't been tit for tat ... with the young\nchampion....\"  Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded\npaper toward Archer.  \"This report, the result of discreet enquiries\n...\"  And then, as Archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to\nrepudiate the suggestion, the lawyer somewhat flatly continued:  \"I\ndon't say it's conclusive, you observe; far from it.  But straws show\n... and on the whole it's eminently satisfactory for all parties that\nthis dignified solution has been reached.\"\n\n\"Oh, eminently,\" Archer assented, pushing back the paper.\n\nA day or two later, on responding to a summons from Mrs. Manson\nMingott, his soul had been more deeply tried.\n\nHe had found the old lady depressed and querulous.\n\n\"You know she's deserted me?\" she began at once; and without waiting\nfor his reply:  \"Oh, don't ask me why!  She gave so many reasons that\nI've forgotten them all.  My private belief is that she couldn't face\nthe boredom.  At any rate that's what Augusta and my daughters-in-law\nthink.  And I don't know that I altogether blame her.  Olenski's a\nfinished scoundrel; but life with him must have been a good deal gayer\nthan it is in Fifth Avenue.  Not that the family would admit that: they\nthink Fifth Avenue is Heaven with the rue de la Paix thrown in.  And\npoor Ellen, of course, has no idea of going back to her husband.  She\nheld out as firmly as ever against that.  So she's to settle down in\nParis with that fool Medora....  Well, Paris is Paris; and you can keep\na carriage there on next to nothing.  But she was as gay as a bird, and\nI shall miss her.\" Two tears, the parched tears of the old, rolled down\nher puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom.\n\n\"All I ask is,\" she concluded, \"that they shouldn't bother me any more.\nI must really be allowed to digest my gruel....\"  And she twinkled a\nlittle wistfully at Archer.\n\nIt was that evening, on his return home, that May announced her\nintention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin.  Madame Olenska's\nname had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight\nto Washington; and Archer looked at his wife with surprise.\n\n\"A dinner--why?\" he interrogated.\n\nHer colour rose.  \"But you like Ellen--I thought you'd be pleased.\"\n\n\"It's awfully nice--your putting it in that way.  But I really don't\nsee--\"\n\n\"I mean to do it, Newland,\" she said, quietly rising and going to her\ndesk.  \"Here are the invitations all written.  Mother helped me--she\nagrees that we ought to.\"  She paused, embarrassed and yet smiling, and\nArcher suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the Family.\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of\nguests that she had put in his hand.\n\nWhen he entered the drawing-room before dinner May was stooping over\nthe fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed\nsetting of immaculate tiles.\n\nThe tall lamps were all lit, and Mr. van der Luyden's orchids had been\nconspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and\nknobby silver.  Mrs. Newland Archer's drawing-room was generally\nthought a great success.  A gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the\nprimulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed, blocked the access to\nthe bay window (where the old-fashioned would have preferred a bronze\nreduction of the Venus of Milo); the sofas and arm-chairs of pale\nbrocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered\nwith silver toys, porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames;\nand tall rosy-shaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the\npalms.\n\n\"I don't think Ellen has ever seen this room lighted up,\" said May,\nrising flushed from her struggle, and sending about her a glance of\npardonable pride.  The brass tongs which she had propped against the\nside of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husband's\nanswer; and before he could restore them Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden\nwere announced.\n\nThe other guests quickly followed, for it was known that the van der\nLuydens liked to dine punctually.  The room was nearly full, and Archer\nwas engaged in showing to Mrs. Selfridge Merry a small highly-varnished\nVerbeckhoven \"Study of Sheep,\" which Mr. Welland had given May for\nChristmas, when he found Madame Olenska at his side.\n\nShe was excessively pale, and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser\nand heavier than ever.  Perhaps that, or the fact that she had wound\nseveral rows of amber beads about her neck, reminded him suddenly of\nthe little Ellen Mingott he had danced with at children's parties, when\nMedora Manson had first brought her to New York.\n\nThe amber beads were trying to her complexion, or her dress was perhaps\nunbecoming: her face looked lustreless and almost ugly, and he had\nnever loved it as he did at that minute.  Their hands met, and he\nthought he heard her say:  \"Yes, we're sailing tomorrow in the\nRussia--\"; then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors, and\nafter an interval May's voice:  \"Newland!  Dinner's been announced.\nWon't you please take Ellen in?\"\n\nMadame Olenska put her hand on his arm, and he noticed that the hand\nwas ungloved, and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the\nevening that he had sat with her in the little Twenty-third Street\ndrawing-room.  All the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have\ntaken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on\nhis sleeve, and he said to himself: \"If it were only to see her hand\nagain I  should  have  to follow her--.\"\n\nIt was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a \"foreign\nvisitor\" that Mrs. van der Luyden could suffer the diminution of being\nplaced on her host's left.  The fact of Madame Olenska's \"foreignness\"\ncould hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell\ntribute; and Mrs. van der Luyden accepted her displacement with an\naffability which left no doubt as to her approval.  There were certain\nthings that had to be done, and if done at all, done handsomely and\nthoroughly; and one of these, in the old New York code, was the tribal\nrally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.  There\nwas nothing on earth that the Wellands and Mingotts would not have done\nto proclaim their unalterable affection for the Countess Olenska now\nthat her passage for Europe was engaged; and Archer, at the head of his\ntable, sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her\npopularity had been retrieved, grievances against her silenced, her\npast countenanced, and her present irradiated by the family approval.\nMrs. van der Luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her\nnearest approach to cordiality, and Mr. van der Luyden, from his seat\nat May's right, cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify\nall the carnations he had sent from Skuytercliff.\n\nArcher, who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd\nimponderability, as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and\nceiling, wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the\nproceedings.  As his glance travelled from one placid well-fed face to\nanother he saw all the harmless-looking people engaged upon May's\ncanvas-backs as a band of dumb conspirators, and himself and the pale\nwoman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy.  And then it came\nover him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of\nthem he and Madame Olenska were lovers, lovers in the extreme sense\npeculiar to \"foreign\" vocabularies.  He guessed himself to have been,\nfor months, the centre of countless silently observing eyes and\npatiently listening ears; he understood that, by means as yet unknown\nto him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had\nbeen achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife\non the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined\nanything, and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply May\nArcher's natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and\ncousin.\n\nIt was the old New York way of taking life \"without effusion of blood\":\nthe way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed\ndecency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more\nill-bred than \"scenes,\" except the behaviour of those who gave rise to\nthem.\n\nAs these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind Archer felt like a\nprisoner in the centre of an armed camp.  He looked about the table,\nand guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in\nwhich, over the asparagus from Florida, they were dealing with Beaufort\nand his wife.  \"It's to show me,\" he thought, \"what would happen to\nME--\" and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy\nover direct action, and of silence over rash words, closed in on him\nlike the doors of the family vault.\n\nHe laughed, and met Mrs. van der Luyden's startled eyes.\n\n\"You think it laughable?\" she said with a pinched smile.  \"Of course\npoor Regina's idea of remaining in New York has its ridiculous side, I\nsuppose;\" and Archer muttered:  \"Of course.\"\n\nAt this point, he became conscious that Madame Olenska's other\nneighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right.\nAt the same moment he saw that May, serenely enthroned between Mr. van\nder Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, had cast a quick glance down the\ntable.  It was evident that the host and the lady on his right could\nnot sit through the whole meal in silence.  He turned to Madame\nOlenska, and her pale smile met him.  \"Oh, do let's see it through,\" it\nseemed to say.\n\n\"Did you find the journey tiring?\" he asked in a voice that surprised\nhim by its naturalness; and she answered that, on the contrary, she had\nseldom travelled with fewer discomforts.\n\n\"Except, you know, the dreadful heat in the train,\" she added; and he\nremarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the\ncountry she was going to.\n\n\"I never,\" he declared with intensity, \"was more nearly frozen than\nonce, in April, in the train between Calais and Paris.\"\n\nShe said she did not wonder, but remarked that, after all, one could\nalways carry an extra rug, and that every form of travel had its\nhardships; to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no\naccount compared with the blessedness of getting away.  She changed\ncolour, and he added, his voice suddenly rising in pitch:  \"I mean to\ndo a lot of travelling myself before long.\"  A tremor crossed her face,\nand leaning over to Reggie Chivers, he cried out:  \"I say, Reggie, what\ndo you say to a trip round the world: now, next month, I mean?  I'm\ngame if you are--\" at which Mrs. Reggie piped up that she could not\nthink of letting Reggie go till after the Martha Washington Ball she\nwas getting up for the Blind Asylum in Easter week; and her husband\nplacidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for\nthe International Polo match.\n\nBut Mr. Selfridge Merry had caught the phrase \"round the world,\" and\nhaving once circled the globe in his steam-yacht, he seized the\nopportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning\nthe shallowness of the Mediterranean ports.  Though, after all, he\nadded, it didn't matter; for when you'd seen Athens and Smyrna and\nConstantinople, what else was there?  And Mrs. Merry said she could\nnever be too grateful to Dr. Bencomb for having made them promise not\nto go to Naples on account of the fever.\n\n\"But you must have three weeks to do India properly,\" her husband\nconceded, anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous\nglobe-trotter.\n\nAnd at this point the ladies went up to the drawing-room.\n\nIn the library, in spite of weightier presences, Lawrence Lefferts\npredominated.\n\nThe talk, as usual, had veered around to the Beauforts, and even Mr.\nvan der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, installed in the honorary\narm-chairs tacitly reserved for them, paused to listen to the younger\nman's philippic.\n\nNever had Lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn Christian\nmanhood and exalt the sanctity of the home.  Indignation lent him a\nscathing eloquence, and it was clear that if others had followed his\nexample, and acted as he talked, society would never have been weak\nenough to receive a foreign upstart like Beaufort--no, sir, not even if\nhe'd married a van der Luyden or a Lanning instead of a Dallas.  And\nwhat chance would there have been, Lefferts wrathfully questioned, of\nhis marrying into such a family as the Dallases, if he had not already\nwormed his way into certain houses, as people like Mrs. Lemuel\nStruthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake?  If society chose to\nopen its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great, though the gain\nwas doubtful; but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure\norigin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegration--and at no\ndistant date.\n\n\"If things go on at this pace,\" Lefferts thundered, looking like a\nyoung prophet dressed by Poole, and who had not yet been stoned, \"we\nshall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers' houses,\nand marrying Beaufort's bastards.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say--draw it mild!\" Reggie Chivers and young Newland protested,\nwhile Mr. Selfridge Merry looked genuinely alarmed, and an expression\nof pain and disgust settled on Mr. van der Luyden's sensitive face.\n\n\"Has he got any?\" cried Mr. Sillerton Jackson, pricking up his ears;\nand while Lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh, the old\ngentleman twittered into Archer's ear:  \"Queer, those fellows who are\nalways wanting to set things right.  The people who have the worst\ncooks are always telling you they're poisoned when they dine out.  But\nI hear there are pressing reasons for our friend Lawrence's\ndiatribe:--typewriter this time, I understand....\"\n\nThe talk swept past Archer like some senseless river running and\nrunning because it did not know enough to stop.  He saw, on the faces\nabout him, expressions of interest, amusement and even mirth.  He\nlistened to the younger men's laughter, and to the praise of the Archer\nMadeira, which Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Merry were thoughtfully\ncelebrating.  Through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude\nof friendliness toward himself, as if the guard of the prisoner he felt\nhimself to be were trying to soften his captivity; and the perception\nincreased his passionate determination to be free.\n\nIn the drawing-room, where they presently joined the ladies, he met\nMay's triumphant eyes, and read in them the conviction that everything\nhad \"gone off\" beautifully.  She rose from Madame Olenska's side, and\nimmediately Mrs. van der Luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the\ngilt sofa where she throned.  Mrs. Selfridge Merry bore across the room\nto join them, and it became clear to Archer that here also a conspiracy\nof rehabilitation and obliteration was going on.  The silent\norganisation which held his little world together was determined to put\nitself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety\nof Madame Olenska's conduct, or the completeness of Archer's domestic\nfelicity.  All these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely\nengaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of,\nsuspected, or even conceived possible, the least hint to the contrary;\nand from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation Archer once more\ndisengaged the fact that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska's\nlover.  He caught the glitter of victory in his wife's eyes, and for\nthe first time understood that she shared the belief.  The discovery\nroused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his\nefforts to discuss the Martha Washington ball with Mrs. Reggie Chivers\nand little Mrs. Newland; and so the evening swept on, running and\nrunning like a senseless river that did not know how to stop.\n\nAt length he saw that Madame Olenska had risen and was saying good-bye.\nHe understood that in a moment she would be gone, and tried to remember\nwhat he had said to her at dinner; but he could not recall a single\nword they had exchanged.\n\nShe went up to May, the rest of the company making a circle about her\nas she advanced.  The two young women clasped hands; then May bent\nforward and kissed her cousin.\n\n\"Certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two,\" Archer heard\nReggie Chivers say in an undertone to young Mrs. Newland; and he\nremembered Beaufort's coarse sneer at May's ineffectual beauty.\n\nA moment later he was in the hall, putting Madame Olenska's cloak about\nher shoulders.\n\nThrough all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to\nsay nothing that might startle or disturb her.  Convinced that no power\ncould now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events\nshape themselves as they would.  But as he followed Madame Olenska into\nthe hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone\nwith her at the door of her carriage.\n\n\"Is your carriage here?\" he asked; and at that moment Mrs. van der\nLuyden, who was being majestically inserted into her sables, said\ngently:  \"We are driving dear Ellen home.\"\n\nArcher's heart gave a jerk, and Madame Olenska, clasping her cloak and\nfan with one hand, held out the other to him.  \"Good-bye,\" she said.\n\n\"Good-bye--but I shall see you soon in Paris,\" he answered aloud--it\nseemed to him that he had shouted it.\n\n\"Oh,\" she murmured, \"if you and May could come--!\"\n\nMr. van der Luyden advanced to give her his arm, and Archer turned to\nMrs. van der Luyden.  For a moment, in the billowy darkness inside the\nbig landau, he caught the dim oval of a face, eyes shining\nsteadily--and she was gone.\n\nAs he went up the steps he crossed Lawrence Lefferts coming down with\nhis wife.  Lefferts caught his host by the sleeve, drawing back to let\nGertrude pass.\n\n\"I say, old chap: do you mind just letting it be understood that I'm\ndining with you at the club tomorrow night?  Thanks so much, you old\nbrick!  Good-night.\"\n\n\"It DID go off beautifully, didn't it?\" May questioned from the\nthreshold of the library.\n\nArcher roused himself with a start.  As soon as the last carriage had\ndriven away, he had come up to the library and shut himself in, with\nthe hope that his wife, who still lingered below, would go straight to\nher room.  But there she stood, pale and drawn, yet radiating the\nfactitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue.\n\n\"May I come and talk it over?\" she asked.\n\n\"Of course, if you like.  But you must be awfully sleepy--\"\n\n\"No, I'm not sleepy.  I should like to sit with you a little.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, pushing her chair near the fire.\n\nShe sat down and he resumed his seat; but neither spoke for a long\ntime.  At length Archer began abruptly: \"Since you're not tired, and\nwant to talk, there's something I must tell you.  I tried to the other\nnight--.\"\n\nShe looked at him quickly.  \"Yes, dear.  Something about yourself?\"\n\n\"About myself.  You say you're not tired: well, I am.  Horribly tired\n...\"\n\nIn an instant she was all tender anxiety.  \"Oh, I've seen it coming on,\nNewland!  You've been so wickedly overworked--\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's that.  Anyhow, I want to make a break--\"\n\n\"A break?  To give up the law?\"\n\n\"To go away, at any rate--at once.  On a long trip, ever so far\noff--away from everything--\"\n\nHe paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with\nthe indifference of a man who longs for a change, and is yet too weary\nto welcome it.  Do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated.\n\"Away from everything--\" he repeated.\n\n\"Ever so far?  Where, for instance?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.  India--or Japan.\"\n\nShe stood up, and as he sat with bent head, his chin propped on his\nhands, he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him.\n\n\"As far as that?  But I'm afraid you can't, dear ...\" she said in an\nunsteady voice.  \"Not unless you'll take me with you.\"  And then, as he\nwas silent, she went on, in tones so clear and evenly-pitched that each\nseparate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain:  \"That is,\nif the doctors will let me go ... but I'm afraid they won't.  For you\nsee, Newland, I've been sure since this morning of something I've been\nso longing and hoping for--\"\n\nHe looked up at her with a sick stare, and she sank down, all dew and\nroses, and hid her face against his knee.\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" he said, holding her to him while his cold hand stroked\nher hair.\n\nThere was a long pause, which the inner devils filled with strident\nlaughter; then May freed herself from his arms and stood up.\n\n\"You didn't guess--?\"\n\n\"Yes--I; no.  That is, of course I hoped--\"\n\nThey looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent; then,\nturning his eyes from hers, he asked abruptly:  \"Have you told any one\nelse?\"\n\n\"Only Mamma and your mother.\"  She paused, and then added hurriedly,\nthe blood flushing up to her forehead:  \"That is--and Ellen.  You know\nI told you we'd had a long talk one afternoon--and how dear she was to\nme.\"\n\n\"Ah--\" said Archer, his heart stopping.\n\nHe felt that his wife was watching him intently.  \"Did you MIND my\ntelling her first, Newland?\"\n\n\"Mind?  Why should I?\"  He made a last effort to collect himself.  \"But\nthat was a fortnight ago, wasn't it?  I thought you said you weren't\nsure till today.\"\n\nHer colour burned deeper, but she held his gaze.  \"No; I wasn't sure\nthen--but I told her I was.  And you see I was right!\" she exclaimed,\nher blue eyes wet with victory.\n\n\n\nNewland Archer sat at the writing-table in his library in East\nThirty-ninth Street.\n\nHe had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration\nof the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, and the spectacle of\nthose great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages, where the\nthrong of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically\ncatalogued treasures, had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory.\n\n\"Why, this used to be one of the old Cesnola rooms,\" he heard some one\nsay; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting\nalone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight figure\nin a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely-fitted vista of\nthe old Museum.\n\nThe vision had roused a host of other associations, and he sat looking\nwith new eyes at the library which, for over thirty years, had been the\nscene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations.\n\nIt was the room in which most of the real things of his life had\nhappened.  There his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to\nhim, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young\nwomen of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a\nchild; and there their eldest boy, Dallas, too delicate to be taken to\nchurch in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the Bishop\nof New York, the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop, so long the\npride and ornament of his diocese.  There Dallas had first staggered\nacross the floor shouting \"Dad,\" while May and the nurse laughed behind\nthe door; there their second child, Mary (who was so like her mother),\nhad announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of Reggie\nChivers's many sons; and there Archer had kissed her through her\nwedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them\nto Grace Church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its\nfoundations the \"Grace Church wedding\" remained an unchanged\ninstitution.\n\nIt was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future\nof the children: the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill,\nMary's incurable indifference to \"accomplishments,\" and passion for\nsport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward \"art\" which had\nfinally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a\nrising New York architect.\n\nThe young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and\nbusiness and taking up all sorts of new things.  If they were not\nabsorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that\nthey were going in for Central American archaeology, for architecture\nor landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the\nprerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting\nGeorgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word\n\"Colonial.\"  Nobody nowadays had \"Colonial\" houses except the\nmillionaire grocers of the suburbs.\n\nBut above all--sometimes Archer put it above all--it was in that\nlibrary that the Governor of New York, coming down from Albany one\nevening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said,\nbanging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses:\n\"Hang the professional politician!  You're the kind of man the country\nwants, Archer.  If the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you\nhave got to lend a hand in the cleaning.\"\n\n\"Men like you--\" how Archer had glowed at the phrase!  How eagerly he\nhad risen up at the call!  It was an echo of Ned Winsett's old appeal\nto roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man\nwho set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was\nirresistible.\n\nArcher, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself WERE what\nhis country needed, at least in the active service to which Theodore\nRoosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not,\nfor after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re-elected, and\nhad dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and\nfrom that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the\nreforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its\napathy.  It was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered\nto what the young men of his generation and his set had looked\nforward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which\ntheir vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new\nstate of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built\nwall.  He had done little in public life; he would always be by nature\na contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to\ncontemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man's friendship\nto be his strength and pride.\n\nHe had been, in short, what people were beginning to call \"a good\ncitizen.\"  In New York, for many years past, every new movement,\nphilanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion\nand wanted his name.  People said:  \"Ask Archer\" when there was a\nquestion of starting the first school for crippled children,\nreorganising the Museum of Art, founding the Grolier Club, inaugurating\nthe new Library, or getting up a new society of chamber music.  His\ndays were full, and they were filled decently.  He supposed it was all\na man ought to ask.\n\nSomething he knew he had missed: the flower of life.  But he thought of\nit now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined\nwould have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first\nprize in a lottery.  There were a hundred million tickets in HIS\nlottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too\ndecidedly against him.  When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was\nabstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a\nbook or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he\nhad missed.  That vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him\nfrom thinking of other women.  He had been what was called a faithful\nhusband; and when May had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious\npneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had\nhonestly mourned her.  Their long years together had shown him that it\ndid not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept\nthe dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of\nugly appetites.  Looking about him, he honoured his own past, and\nmourned for it.  After all, there was good in the old ways.\n\nHis eyes, making the round of the room--done over by Dallas with\nEnglish mezzotints, Chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white\nand pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old Eastlake\nwriting-table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his\nfirst photograph of May, which still kept its place beside his inkstand.\n\nThere she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin\nand flapping Leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the\nMission garden.  And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;\nnever quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous,\nfaithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of\ngrowth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt\nitself without her ever being conscious of the change.  This hard\nbright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered.\nHer incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their\nviews from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first,\na joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in\nwhich father and children had unconsciously collaborated.  And she had\ndied thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious\nhouseholds like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was\nconvinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate\nin Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his\nparents' lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her)\nwould transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.  And of Mary she was\nsure as of her own self.  So, having snatched little Bill from the\ngrave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her\nplace in the Archer vault in St.  Mark's, where Mrs. Archer already lay\nsafe from the terrifying \"trend\" which her daughter-in-law had never\neven become aware of.\n\nOpposite May's portrait stood one of her daughter.  Mary Chivers was as\ntall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and\nslightly slouching, as the altered fashion required.  Mary Chivers's\nmighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the\ntwenty-inch waist that May Archer's azure sash so easily spanned.  And\nthe difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely\ngirt as her figure.  Mary, who was no less conventional, and no more\nintelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.  There\nwas good in the new order too.\n\nThe telephone clicked, and Archer, turning from the photographs,\nunhooked the transmitter at his elbow.  How far they were from the days\nwhen the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been New York's\nonly means of quick communication!\n\n\"Chicago wants you.\"\n\nAh--it must be a long-distance from Dallas, who had been sent to\nChicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the Lakeside palace they\nwere to build for a young millionaire with ideas.  The firm always sent\nDallas on such errands.\n\n\"Hallo, Dad--Yes: Dallas.  I say--how do you feel about sailing on\nWednesday?  Mauretania: Yes, next Wednesday as ever is.  Our client\nwants me to look at some Italian gardens before we settle anything, and\nhas asked me to nip over on the next boat.  I've got to be back on the\nfirst of June--\" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--\"so we\nmust look alive.  I say, Dad, I want your help: do come.\"\n\nDallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and\nnatural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the\nfire.  The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer, for\nlong-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as\nelectric lighting and five-day Atlantic voyages.  But the laugh did\nstartle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and\nmiles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and\nbusy indifferent millions--Dallas's laugh should be able to say: \"Of\ncourse, whatever happens, I must get back on the first, because Fanny\nBeaufort and I are to be married on the fifth.\"\n\nThe voice began again:  \"Think it over?  No, sir: not a minute.  You've\ngot to say yes now.  Why not, I'd like to know?  If you can allege a\nsingle reason--No; I knew it.  Then it's a go, eh?  Because I count on\nyou to ring up the Cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you'd better\nbook a return on a boat from Marseilles.  I say, Dad; it'll be our last\ntime together, in this kind of way--.  Oh, good!  I knew you would.\"\n\nChicago rang off, and Archer rose and began to pace up and down the\nroom.\n\nIt would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was\nright.  They would have lots of other \"times\" after Dallas's marriage,\nhis father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and Fanny\nBeaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to\ninterfere with their intimacy.  On the contrary, from what he had seen\nof her, he thought she would be naturally included in it.  Still,\nchange was change, and differences were differences, and much as he\nfelt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting\nto seize this last chance of being alone with his boy.\n\nThere was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one\nthat he had lost the habit of travel.  May had disliked to move except\nfor valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the\nmountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in\nThirty-ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands' in\nNewport.  After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty\nto travel for six months; and the whole family had made the\nold-fashioned tour through England, Switzerland and Italy.  Their time\nbeing limited (no one knew why) they had omitted France.  Archer\nremembered Dallas's wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc\ninstead of Rheims and Chartres.  But Mary and Bill wanted\nmountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in Dallas's wake\nthrough the English cathedrals; and May, always fair to her children,\nhad insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and\nartistic proclivities.  She had indeed proposed that her husband should\ngo to Paris for a fortnight, and join them on the Italian lakes after\nthey had \"done\" Switzerland; but Archer had declined.  \"We'll stick\ntogether,\" he said; and May's face had brightened at his setting such a\ngood example to Dallas.\n\nSince her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for\nhis continuing in the same routine.  His children had urged him to\ntravel: Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad\nand \"see the galleries.\"  The very mysteriousness of such a cure made\nher the more confident of its efficacy.  But Archer had found himself\nheld fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from\nnew things.\n\nNow, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk.\nThe worst of doing one's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for\ndoing anything else.  At least that was the view that the men of his\ngeneration had taken.  The trenchant divisions between right and wrong,\nhonest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little\nscope for the unforeseen.  There are moments when a man's imagination,\nso easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily\nlevel, and surveys the long windings of destiny.  Archer hung there and\nwondered....\n\nWhat was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose\nstandards had bent and bound him?  He remembered a sneering prophecy of\npoor Lawrence Lefferts's, uttered years ago in that very room:  \"If\nthings go on at this rate, our children will be marrying Beaufort's\nbastards.\"\n\nIt was just what Archer's eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing;\nand nobody wondered or reproved.  Even the boy's Aunt Janey, who still\nlooked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her\nmother's emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and\ncarried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and\nFanny Beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a\n\"set\" from a Paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned\nbeauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an\nIsabey miniature.\n\nFanny Beaufort, who had appeared in New York at eighteen, after the\ndeath of her parents, had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won\nit thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid\nof her, society took her joyfully for granted.  She was pretty, amusing\nand accomplished: what more did any one want?  Nobody was narrow-minded\nenough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father's\npast and her own origin.  Only the older people remembered so obscure\nan incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort's failure, or\nthe fact that after his wife's death he had been quietly married to the\nnotorious Fanny Ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a\nlittle girl who inherited her beauty.  He was subsequently heard of in\nConstantinople, then in Russia; and a dozen years later American\ntravellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres, where he\nrepresented a large insurance agency.  He and his wife died there in\nthe odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had\nappeared in New York in charge of May Archer's sister-in-law, Mrs. Jack\nWelland, whose husband had been appointed the girl's guardian.  The\nfact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer's\nchildren, and nobody was surprised when Dallas's engagement was\nannounced.\n\nNothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the\nworld had travelled.  People nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms\nand \"movements,\" with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much\nabout their neighbours.  And of what account was anybody's past, in the\nhuge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same\nplane?\n\nNewland Archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety\nof the Paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and\neagerness of youth.\n\nIt was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening\nwaistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot\ntemples.  He wondered if it was thus that his son's conducted itself in\nthe presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort--and decided that it was not.  \"It\nfunctions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different,\" he\nreflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had\nannounced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would\napprove.\n\n\"The difference is that these young people take it for granted that\nthey're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took\nit for granted that we shouldn't.  Only, I wonder--the thing one's so\ncertain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?\"\n\nIt was the day after their arrival in Paris, and the spring sunshine\nheld Archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the\nPlace Vendome.  One of the things he had stipulated--almost the only\none--when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas, was that, in Paris,\nhe shouldn't be made to go to one of the newfangled \"palaces.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right--of course,\" Dallas good-naturedly agreed.  \"I'll take\nyou to some jolly old-fashioned place--the Bristol say--\" leaving his\nfather speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and\nemperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for\nits quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour.\n\nArcher had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the\nscene of his return to Paris; then the personal vision had faded, and\nhe had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska's\nlife.  Sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had\ngone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the\navenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public\ngardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll\nof the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and\npleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting.  Now the spectacle\nwas before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy,\nold-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the\nruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being....\n\nDallas's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder.  \"Hullo, father: this\nis something like, isn't it?\"  They stood for a while looking out in\nsilence, and then the young man continued:  \"By the way, I've got a\nmessage for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half-past\nfive.\"\n\nHe said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual\nitem of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave\nfor Florence the next evening.  Archer looked at him, and thought he\nsaw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother Mingott's\nmalice.\n\n\"Oh, didn't I tell you?\" Dallas pursued.  \"Fanny made me swear to do\nthree things while I was in Paris: get her the score of the last\nDebussy songs, go to the Grand-Guignol and see Madame Olenska.  You\nknow she was awfully good to Fanny when Mr. Beaufort sent her over from\nBuenos Ayres to the Assomption.  Fanny hadn't any friends in Paris, and\nMadame Olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays.\nI believe she was a great friend of the first Mrs. Beaufort's.  And\nshe's our cousin, of course.  So I rang her up this morning, before I\nwent out, and told her you and I were here for two days and wanted to\nsee her.\"\n\nArcher continued to stare at him.  \"You told her I was here?\"\n\n\"Of course--why not?\"  Dallas's eye brows went up whimsically.  Then,\ngetting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father's with a\nconfidential pressure.\n\n\"I say, father: what was she like?\"\n\nArcher felt his colour rise under his son's unabashed gaze.  \"Come, own\nup: you and she were great pals, weren't you?  Wasn't she most awfully\nlovely?\"\n\n\"Lovely?  I don't know.  She was different.\"\n\n\"Ah--there you have it!  That's what it always comes to, doesn't it?\nWhen she comes, SHE'S DIFFERENT--and one doesn't know why.  It's\nexactly what I feel about Fanny.\"\n\nHis father drew back a step, releasing his arm.  \"About Fanny?  But, my\ndear fellow--I should hope so!  Only I don't see--\"\n\n\"Dash it, Dad, don't be prehistoric!  Wasn't she--once--your Fanny?\"\n\nDallas belonged body and soul to the new generation.  He was the\nfirst-born of Newland and May Archer, yet it had never been possible to\ninculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve.  \"What's the use of\nmaking mysteries?  It only makes people want to nose 'em out,\" he\nalways objected when enjoined to discretion.  But Archer, meeting his\neyes, saw the filial light under their banter.\n\n\"My Fanny?\"\n\n\"Well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't,\"\ncontinued his surprising son.\n\n\"I didn't,\" echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity.\n\n\"No: you date, you see, dear old boy.  But mother said--\"\n\n\"Your mother?\"\n\n\"Yes: the day before she died.  It was when she sent for me alone--you\nremember?  She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would\nbe, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you\nmost wanted.\"\n\nArcher received this strange communication in silence.  His eyes\nremained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the\nwindow.  At length he said in a low voice:  \"She never asked me.\"\n\n\"No.  I forgot.  You never did ask each other anything, did you?  And\nyou never told each other anything.  You just sat and watched each\nother, and guessed at what was going on underneath.  A deaf-and-dumb\nasylum, in fact!  Well, I back your generation for knowing more about\neach other's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about\nour own.--I say, Dad,\" Dallas broke off, \"you're not angry with me?  If\nyou are, let's make it up and go and lunch at Henri's.  I've got to\nrush out to Versailles afterward.\"\n\nArcher did not accompany his son to Versailles.  He preferred to spend\nthe afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris.  He had to deal all\nat once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate\nlifetime.\n\nAfter a little while he did not regret Dallas's indiscretion.  It\nseemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all,\nsome one had guessed and pitied....  And that it should have been his\nwife moved him indescribably.  Dallas, for all his affectionate\ninsight, would not have understood that.  To the boy, no doubt, the\nepisode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted\nforces.  But was it really no more?  For a long time Archer sat on a\nbench in the Champs Elysees and wondered, while the stream of life\nrolled by....\n\nA few streets away, a few hours away, Ellen Olenska waited.  She had\nnever gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years\nbefore, she had made no change in her way of living.  There was nothing\nnow to keep her and Archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her.\n\nHe got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries\ngardens to the Louvre.  She had once told him that she often went\nthere, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place\nwhere he could think of her as perhaps having lately been.  For an hour\nor more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of\nafternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their\nhalf-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of\nbeauty.  After all, his life had been too starved....\n\nSuddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying:  \"But\nI'm only fifty-seven--\" and then he turned away.  For such summer\ndreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of\nfriendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.\n\nHe went back to the hotel, where he and Dallas were to meet; and\ntogether they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the\nbridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nDallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father's mind, was\ntalking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles.  He had had but one\nprevious glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to\npack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with\nthe family to Switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure\ncriticism tripped each other up on his lips.\n\nAs Archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness\nincreased.  The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the\nfacility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a\nmaster but as an equal.  \"That's it: they feel equal to things--they\nknow their way about,\" he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman\nof the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and\nwith them the sign-posts and the danger-signal.\n\nSuddenly Dallas stopped short, grasping his father's arm.  \"Oh, by\nJove,\" he exclaimed.\n\nThey had come out into the great tree-planted space before the\nInvalides.  The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding\ntrees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself\nall the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol\nof the race's glory.\n\nArcher knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the\navenues radiating from the Invalides; and he had pictured the quarter\nas quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit\nit up.  Now, by some queer process of association, that golden light\nbecame for him the pervading illumination in which she lived.  For\nnearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely\nlittle--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to\nbe too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs.  He thought of the\ntheatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at,\nthe sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people\nshe must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities,\nimages and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a\nsetting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young\nFrenchman who had once said to him:  \"Ah, good conversation--there is\nnothing like it, is there?\"\n\nArcher had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty\nyears; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame\nOlenska's existence.  More than half a lifetime divided them, and she\nhad spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society\nhe but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly\nunderstand.  During that time he had been living with his youthful\nmemory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible\ncompanionship.  Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something\napart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim\nchapel, where there was not time to pray every day....\n\nThey had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of\nthe thoroughfares flanking the building.  It was a quiet quarter, after\nall, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one\nan idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this\nwere left to the few and the indifferent.\n\nThe day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by\na yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square\ninto which they had turned.  Dallas stopped again, and looked up.\n\n\"It must be here,\" he said, slipping his arm through his father's with\na movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood\ntogether looking up at the house.\n\nIt was a modern building, without distinctive character, but\nmany-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured\nfront.  On one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the\nrounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were\nstill lowered, as though the sun had just left it.\n\n\"I wonder which floor--?\" Dallas conjectured; and moving toward the\nporte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to\nsay:  \"The fifth.  It must be the one with the awnings.\"\n\nArcher remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end\nof their pilgrimage had been attained.\n\n\"I say, you know, it's nearly six,\" his son at length reminded him.\n\nThe father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees.\n\n\"I believe I'll sit there a moment,\" he said.\n\n\"Why--aren't you well?\" his son exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, perfectly.  But I should like you, please, to go up without me.\"\n\nDallas paused before him, visibly bewildered.  \"But, I say, Dad: do you\nmean you won't come up at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Archer slowly.\n\n\"If you don't she won't understand.\"\n\n\"Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you.\"\n\nDallas gave him a long look through the twilight.\n\n\"But what on earth shall I say?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?\" his father\nrejoined with a smile.\n\n\"Very well.  I shall say you're old-fashioned, and prefer walking up\nthe five flights because you don't like lifts.\"\n\nHis father smiled again.  \"Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough.\"\n\nDallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture,\npassed out of sight under the vaulted doorway.\n\nArcher sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged\nbalcony.  He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up\nin the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to\nthe hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.  He pictured Dallas\nentering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful\nsmile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy\n\"took after him.\"\n\nThen he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at\nthat sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark\nlady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out\na long thin hand with three rings on it....  He thought she would be\nsitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her\non a table.\n\n\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard\nhimself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose\nits edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each\nother.\n\nHe sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes\nnever turning from the balcony.  At length a light shone through the\nwindows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew\nup the awnings, and closed the shutters.\n\nAt that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got\nup slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.\n\n\n\n\nA Note on the Text\n\nThe Age of Innocence first appeared in four large installments in The\nPictorial Review, from July to October 1920.

At the dinner, Archer notices that the guests are remarkably kind to Ellen now that she is about to leave. With a start, he realizes that the entire clan assumes that he has been having an affair with Ellen for quite some time. Although the guests are too polite to even allude to the affair, their elaborately feigned innocence is, to Archer, the surest sign that they suspect an infidelity. Suddenly, the dinner seems to be the disguise for a celebratory send-off of a member of the clan who has violated their strict social code.

As Archer sits surrounded by his family and friends, it dawns on him as to why they are acting so cordially toward Ellen. She is leaving them permanently. Now that they are certain that she will no longer threaten their stable little society, they are willing to give her a celebratory send-off. Just as suddenly, Archer realizes why they are so eager for her to leave: they assume that he and Ellen have been having an affair for months. It is unbearably ironic to Archer that they are convinced that he has been enjoying an affair when in reality this is the very thing he has not been able to attain. His situation is contrasted by that of Larry Lefferts, who, as he leaves, asks Archer to cover for him so he can meet with his own mistress the next night. That Lefferts's real adulteries can remain hidden under a veneer of manners and pious exclamations while Archer's supposed affair leaves him vulnerable to judgment increases the scene's sense of irony. Between Chapter 33 and 34, there is an enormous chronological gap of about twenty-six years. By abruptly switching to the turn of the century without showing any development of plot or characters, Wharton indicates the discontinuity of the past with the present. By the time Archer reaches middle- age, the world around him has changed dramatically. His children have less leisure time but more freedom and more opportunities than he ever had. The world of his youth is now considered old-fashioned, even a little obsolete. This perhaps explains why Archer's life with May after the announcement of her pregnancy is told as if it were a history. Even though his life with her is important in explaining his current circumstances, May remains only as a memory of the irretrievable past. What about Ellen? Is she, too, relegated to the past, to remain a hazy image in Archer's memory? It has been many years since he last saw her at May's dinner party, and he cannot imagine how she must have changed from the young woman he remembers. He wonders, in turn, what Ellen remembers of him, whether or not he only remains in her memory \"like a relic in a small dim chapel.\" In Paris, Archer is faced with the rather bewildering prospect of seeing her once again. Standing on the street below her apartment, he sees how different her life must have become in the last twenty-six years. He wonders how the present reality and his own idealized memories of Ellen can possibly connect. In the end Archer chooses to be left with the memory of Ellen and not Ellen herself. Not seeing the real--and now significantly older--person allows him, in certain respects, to maintain her as a symbolic presence, an emblem of the wistfulness and regrets of his youth. This quiet wistful ending is not what the reader expects. It is neither tragic nor happy. Nor is it inevitable. There is now nothing stopping Archer from reuniting with Ellen; he is only in his fifties, he has been widowed, and he is living in a new and liberal age. If Wharton had chosen to have the two characters meet again, there could be two possible outcomes. Either they would passionately reunite, or they would realize that they had changed too much in their time apart. But Wharton does not allow us to see either possibility. By departing from a traditional happy or tragic ending, she frustrates her readers' expectations. As with Archer's and Ellen's unconsummated affair, Wharton leaves the plot incomplete rather than giving it a predictable ending.","summary_length":531.0,"analysis_length":618.0,"chap_int":34,"previous summary id":["chapter 33","chapter 33","chapters 31-33"],"previous chapter":["The Archers begin setting up for their first dinner party, \"a big event\" for a young couple. The party will be in honor of Ellen Olenska leaving New York and returning to Europe. Although Ellen had not spoken to Newland in ten days, he returned a key that he had given her earlier in a blank envelope. Newland is assigned the job of evaluating Ellen1s trust. All the while that he is taking care of her finances, he think that there will be an affair between the two in the future. His belief in the future keeps him from writing her. The night of the dinner party Ellen looks pale, \"lusterless and almost ugly. But still, Newland had never loved her face as much as he did at that moment. Newland notices that Ellen1s hand is ungloved. Newland thinks, \"If it were only to see her hand again I should have to follow her \" Normally only \"foreign visitors\" would be important enough to sit at the hosts left and take the place of Mrs. van der Luyden. But, they make an exception and let Ellen sit to the host1s left because, \"There were certain things that had to be done, and If done at all, done handsomely and thoroughly; and one of these in the old New York code, was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe. Newland realizes that everyone thinks that a true \"affair\" had been going on between Newland and Ellen; the celebration is really because the \"separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved. It was the New York way to take a life without any traces of blood. Everyone sits at the table discussing travel in a dispassionate way. Newland looks at Ellen; he imagines she is thinking, \"Let1s see it through,\" which means, let1s have our affair as planned. All the men retire to the library after dinner, and discuss how their society is changing. Larry Lefferts says, \"If things go on at this pace we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers1 houses and marrying Beaufort1s bastards. Later that evening, May asks if it is alright if they have a talk. Newland tries to tell her that he is tired of life and wants to go on a long trip; May says, that he can1t go because she found out today that she is pregnant. Newland has a \"sick stare\" and asks who she has told. She says that she1s told Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Welland and. Ellen. She had told Ellen about it two weeks ago. Newland asks her why she would tell Ellen about her pregnancy if she was not sure about it until today. She says, \"I wasn1t sure then, but I told her I was.","About ten days after Ellen's departure for Washington, DC, May decides to hold a farewell dinner for Ellen. A day after Ellen had departed, Mr. Letterblair had discussed with Archer some arrangements Mrs. Manson Mingott had made to set up a trust for Ellen with sufficient funds so that she could live independently in Paris. Ellen will live with Marchioness Manson. On the evening of the dinner party, everyone arrives, including the van der Luydens, the Lefferts, the Selfridge Merrys, etc. Finally, Madame Olenska arrives but she and Archer don't have much of a chance to talk alone. Archer has a few polite words with Madame Olenska at dinner, and then he asks Reggie Chivers very loudly whether Chivers would like to travel the world with him. Chivers isn't into the idea, but Mr. Selfridge Merry uses this comment as an opportunity to talk about his adventures traveling the world. Later, in the library, Lefferts goes on about how vulgar the Beauforts are. Then the gentlemen join the women in the drawing room, where Archer is struck by how impossible the women have made it for him to talk with Madame Olenska. As Madame Olenska exits, Archer helps her on with her cloak and thinks he might have a few words alone with her. But Mrs. van der Luyden swoops in and says that Madame Olenska is going home with them. As the guests leave, Lefferts asks Archer to cover for him the next time, presumably so that Lefferts can have an affair with a typist. Later, Archer sits alone in the library when May comes in, wanting to talk about how wonderful the dinner party was. Archer tells May that he would like to travel, preferably someplace distant such as India or Japan. May says that would be quite impossible since she is pregnant. She doesn't say so explicitly, but it is understood between them. Archer is unpleasantly surprised. May says she knew she was pregnant since that morning, when she had told both her mother and his. She also tells Archer that she told Ellen when they had their conversation a couple weeks ago. Archer asks her how she could have, if she had only been certain of her pregnancy that morning. May admits that she wasn't sure, but she told Ellen anyway. It turns out she was right.","Newland's plan is to speak to Ellen, find out what train she will take to Washington, join her, and run away with her to Japan. He will leave a note for May. However, he drops this plan with relief when he learns from Mrs. Mingott that Ellen will be staying with her. On his walk home, he sees Ellen leaving the Beaufort house and stops to speak with her. Unfortunately, Lawrence Lefferts and young Chivers are passing and see them. Newland winces at their discovery and wonders how he and Ellen can live such a covert existence. He pleads with Ellen to meet him alone at the Metropolitan Museum the next day, but she appears to dislike this idea. Despite his earlier theoretical championship of Ellen's freedom as a single woman, his next words indicate his real feelings because after she leaves he says, almost contemptuously, \"she'll come!\" The following day, they meet at the museum amidst the wreckage of earlier civilizations. Discussing their future, she explains that her stay with her grandmother is to keep them from \"doing irreparable harm\" to those who love them. However, she reluctantly gives in to Newland's pressure; she agrees to a future brief sexual encounter, after which she is determined go back to Europe. He feels this intimacy will give him the power to pressure her into staying. Then Newland goes home to May who greets him with the news that she saw Ellen at Mrs. Mingott's and they had \"a really good talk.\" She feels she has misjudged Ellen. The following evening, the van der Luydens attend a small dinner at Mrs. Archer's home before going to the opera. Sillerton Jackson, Newland, and May are also there. They discuss Ellen at some length and disapprove of her taking Mrs. Mingott's carriage to the Beaufort's house. After dinner they attend the opera and Newland recalls that it was the same opera they saw the night he met Ellen. May is wearing her made-over wedding dress and she looks the same after two years except for her paleness. He remembers her saying that she could not have her happiness made out of a wrong to someone else. Deciding to confess all and ask for his freedom, Newland pleads a headache and they go home. At home they settle into the library, but before he can confess, May reveals that Mrs. Manson Mingott has given Ellen an allowance and she is going back to Europe. May had received a letter from Ellen that very afternoon saying that it would be useless for her friends to urge her to change her mind. Cryptically, May adds, \"I think she understands everything,\" and goes to bed. Newland is dumbfounded. Newland later meets with Mrs. Mingott and when he returns home that evening, May announces a going-away dinner for Ellen. She is very assertive when Newland questions her reasons, and she explains that her mother agrees it is the thing to do. The farewell dinner will be their first big dinner since their marriage. It has been 10 days since Newland saw Ellen and he muses that she will return to Europe and he will follow. The night of the dinner arrives and when all are assembled Ellen appears, pale and \"lusterless.\" Every glance at her reminds Newland of memories of his love. Now that Ellen is leaving, the Mingotts and Wellands express their affection for her; it is obvious to Newland that this is \"a tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe.\" Suddenly, Newland realizes that the entire family believes he and Ellen are lovers and they are separating them in the most civilized manner possible. Throughout the evening, Newland and Ellen exchange pleasantries, aware that all eyes are on them. The gentlemen retire to their cigars. Lefferts expounds on the decline of values in New York society, and eventually the men return to the drawing room and \"May's triumphant eyes.\" Newland realizes she shares the belief that he and Ellen are lovers. May kisses Ellen's cheek, vanquishing the foe, and Newland accompanies Ellen to the hall, putting her cloak on her shoulders. When he thinks they might be alone for a moment, the van der Luydens appear and announce they are driving Ellen. He tells her that he will see her soon in Paris, and she correctly says it would be nice if he and May could come. Then she is gone. The dinner is over and Newland and May are in the library. Newland starts to confess once again, but says instead that he needs to go on a long trip because he is very tired. May explains that the doctor might not let her go along, and she reveals that she has already told both her mother and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. It dawns on Newland that the conversation she had with Ellen two weeks earlier was about her pregnancy. She watches Newland intently as she asks if he minds. In questioning her, he finds that she told Ellen this news long before she was sure."],"next summary id":"chapters 33-34","next chapter":"More than a week passes, and Archer has still not heard from Ellen since their meeting in the Museum.

It is late morning and the Reverend Samuel Gardner comes outside to find Frank reading the newspaper. The Reverend has a hangover, having stayed up late drinking with his two guests. Frank tells him that Mrs. Gardner and Bessie, one of Frank's sisters, have gone into town in order to avoid meeting Mrs. Warren, who will be arriving at the house shortly. As Reverend Samuel Gardner excuses himself, Praed enters and scolds Frank for treating his father with disrespect all the time. Mrs. Warren and Vivie arrive, and the Reverend Samuel Gardner goes to meet them nervously. He leads Mrs. Warren and Crofts on a tour of the church and rectory grounds, leaving Frank and Vivie alone together. Vivie and Frank discuss Mrs. Warren. Frank makes fun of her, calling her \\\"an old wretch\\\" and scolding Vivie for pretending to get along with her. Vivie, however, insists that he show her mother more respect. Frank and Vivie's ensuing conversation is flirtatious in a specific way: they play at being children with each other. Vivie wonders if their game is strange, but they decide it's not since neither of them played house in this way as children. Crofts returns to the scene, interrupting their flirtation. He asks Frank to leave. Crofts proposes marriage to Vivie, using the same commercial justification he used with her mother the night before. Whereas Mrs. Warren reacted negatively to this approach, Vivie assures Crofts that she understands and appreciates it. However, she still rejects him, since she does not wish to marry anyone. Crofts does not take her \\\"no\\\" easily, and continues to try to convince her to say yes. In trying to convince her to marry him, Crofts inadvertently reveals to Vivie that her mother is his business partner. Upon learning that Mrs. Warren continues to operate brothels, Vivie becomes sickened. Crofts doesn't understand her reaction, and continues to discuss his and her mother's business as if it were a reason for her to marry him, rather than a reason for her to separate herself from both of them. Vivie tells Crofts that she knew about her mother's profession already, accusing him of wanting to withhold it from her until they were married as a way to break her spirit and manipulate her. She tells him she is disgusted with his work, since unlike her mother, he chose it for the profits. Crofts laughs at her for being naive about where money comes from in the world; in fact, the money that supports her own lifestyle comes from his and her mother's work. She tries to leave and he stops her, so she rings the bell on the gate. Frank appears immediately, having been listening the whole time. He carries a rifle and points it at Crofts, but Vivie tells him to put it away. Before exiting through the gate, Crofts tells Vivie and Frank that they are half-siblings. Frank is still pointing the gun after Crofts, and Vivie puts it to her own chest, telling him to fire. Frank drops the gun and tries to continue their flirtation, but Vivie is disgusted now and leaves to return to the city. Frank runs after her.\", \"analysis\": \"The relationship between mother and daughter has changed in Act III, with the former disrespect Vivie showed her mother now reflected in Frank's attitude toward his father. Frank comes off as resentful and childish in both cases. Praed scolds him for making fun of the Reverend Samuel Gardner, on whom he is financially dependent, and Vivie demands he show more respect to Mrs. Warren. Her attitude toward her mother has changed because, the night before, Mrs. Warren revealed her sympathetic history to her daughter. Vivie and Frank's friendship is revealed as close and flirtatious, if a bit strange. The way they flirt with each other is to pretend to be children, as if they are playing house. They admit that neither of them played this way when they actually were children, suggesting that this kind of interaction is a coping mechanism for something that was absent in their childhoods. Whereas Vivie had shut down Frank's advances the night before, now that she has reconciled with her mother, she is more open to flirting back. However, after Crofts suggests that they are half-siblings, Vivie's interest in this particular flirtation turns cold. She tells Frank, \\\"You make all my flesh creep\\\"  before leaving. Croft's marriage proposal serves to highlight the difference between Vivie's approach to marriage and that of her mother. Whereas both women reject the idea that Crofts should marry Vivie, Mrs. Warren's rejection is based in repulsion at such a commercial approach to marriage. Vivie, on the other hand, tells Crofts that she appreciates how \\\"business-like\\\"  he is about the offer. However, she rejects him based on personal preference. In this act, Crofts reveals to Vivie the rest of Mrs. Warren's secret regarding her profession: she continues to run brothels. Upon learning this new information, Vivie no longer understands her mother's point of view and judges both Mrs. Warren and Crofts harshly. In asking her to keep the secret from others, Crofts invokes convention and the judgment of others: \\\"Since it's been a secret so long, it had better remain so\\\" . The dramatic irony at play here is that Crofts does not know the damage he has just done to the relationship between Vivie and her mother by revealing the rest of this secret. The idea of morality comes into question on a large scale during Crofts argument with Vivie in this act. She accuses him of being immoral for operating brothels purely for the sake of profit. In response, he chastises her for assuming that there is any honest way to make money. He insists that everyone \\\"in decent society\\\"  operates immorally in order to maintain status. The irony of this statement is not lost on Vivie: if everyone in the upper echelons of society is immoral, how can they see themselves as above those people who, like Mrs. Warren, turn to prostitution or other \\\"immoral\\\" work to survive?\"}","chapter":"ACT III\n\n\n[In the Rectory garden next morning, with the sun shining from a\ncloudless sky.

A little path leads through the box hedge,\nbehind the sundial.]\n\n[Frank, seated on the chair near the sundial, on which he has placed the\nmorning paper, is reading The Standard. His father comes from the house,\nred-eyed and shivery, and meets Frank's eye with misgiving.]\n\nFRANK [looking at his watch] Half-past eleven. Nice hour for a rector to\ncome down to breakfast!\n\nREV. S. Don't mock, Frank: don't mock. I am a little--er--[Shivering]--\n\nFRANK. Off color?\n\nREV. S. [repudiating the expression] No, sir: _unwell_ this morning.\nWhere's your mother?\n\nFRANK. Don't be alarmed: she's not here. Gone to town by the 11.13\nwith Bessie. She left several messages for you. Do you feel equal to\nreceiving them now, or shall I wait til you've breakfasted?\n\nREV. S. I h a v e breakfasted, sir. I am surprised at your mother\ngoing to town when we have people staying with us. They'll think it very\nstrange.\n\nFRANK. Possibly she has considered that. At all events, if Crofts is\ngoing to stay here, and you are going to sit up every night with him\nuntil four, recalling the incidents of your fiery youth, it is clearly\nmy mother's duty, as a prudent housekeeper, to go up to the stores and\norder a barrel of whisky and a few hundred siphons.\n\nREV. S. I did not observe that Sir George drank excessively.\n\nFRANK. You were not in a condition to, gov'nor.\n\nREV. S. Do you mean to say that _I_--?\n\nFRANK [calmly] I never saw a beneficed clergyman less sober. The\nanecdotes you told about your past career were so awful that I really\ndon't think Praed would have passed the night under your roof if it hadnt\nbeen for the way my mother and he took to one another.\n\nREV. S. Nonsense, sir. I am Sir George Crofts' host. I must talk to him\nabout something; and he has only one subject. Where is Mr Praed now?\n\nFRANK. He is driving my mother and Bessie to the station.\n\nREV. S. Is Crofts up yet?\n\nFRANK. Oh, long ago. He hasn't turned a hair: he's in much better\npractice than you. Has kept it up ever since, probably. He's taken\nhimself off somewhere to smoke.\n\n[Frank resumes his paper. The parson turns disconsolately towards the\ngate; then comes back irresolutely.]\n\nREV. S. Er--Frank.\n\nFRANK. Yes.\n\nREV. S. Do you think the Warrens will expect to be asked here after\nyesterday afternoon?\n\nFRANK. Theyve been asked already.\n\nREV. S. [appalled] What!!!\n\nFRANK. Crofts informed us at breakfast that you told him to bring Mrs\nWarren and Vivie over here to-day, and to invite them to make this house\ntheir home. My mother then found she must go to town by the 11.13 train.\n\nREV. S. [with despairing vehemence] I never gave any such invitation. I\nnever thought of such a thing.\n\nFRANK [compassionately] How do you know, gov'nor, what you said and\nthought last night?\n\nPRAED [coming in through the hedge] Good morning.\n\nREV. S. Good morning. I must apologize for not having met you at\nbreakfast. I have a touch of--of--\n\nFRANK. Clergyman's sore throat, Praed. Fortunately not chronic.\n\nPRAED [changing the subject] Well I must say your house is in a charming\nspot here. Really most charming.\n\nREV. S. Yes: it is indeed. Frank will take you for a walk, Mr Praed,\nif you like. I'll ask you to excuse me: I must take the opportunity\nto write my sermon while Mrs Gardner is away and you are all amusing\nyourselves. You won't mind, will you?\n\nPRAED. Certainly not. Don't stand on the slightest ceremony with me.\n\nREV. S. Thank you. I'll--er--er--[He stammers his way to the porch and\nvanishes into the house].\n\nPRAED. Curious thing it must be writing a sermon every week.\n\nFRANK. Ever so curious, if he did it. He buys em. He's gone for some\nsoda water.\n\nPRAED. My dear boy: I wish you would be more respectful to your father.\nYou know you can be so nice when you like.\n\nFRANK. My dear Praddy: you forget that I have to live with the governor.\nWhen two people live together--it don't matter whether theyre father and\nson or husband and wife or brother and sister--they can't keep up the\npolite humbug thats so easy for ten minutes on an afternoon call.\nNow the governor, who unites to many admirable domestic qualities the\nirresoluteness of a sheep and the pompousness and aggressiveness of a\njackass--\n\nPRAED. No, pray, pray, my dear Frank, remember! He is your father.\n\nFRANK. I give him due credit for that. [Rising and flinging down his\npaper] But just imagine his telling Crofts to bring the Warrens over\nhere! He must have been ever so drunk. You know, my dear Praddy, my\nmother wouldn't stand Mrs Warren for a moment. Vivie mustn't come here\nuntil she's gone back to town.\n\nPRAED. But your mother doesn't know anything about Mrs Warren, does she?\n[He picks up the paper and sits down to read it].\n\nFRANK. I don't know. Her journey to town looks as if she did. Not that\nmy mother would mind in the ordinary way: she has stuck like a brick to\nlots of women who had got into trouble. But they were all nice women.\nThats what makes the real difference. Mrs Warren, no doubt, has her\nmerits; but she's ever so rowdy; and my mother simply wouldn't put up\nwith her. So--hallo! [This exclamation is provoked by the reappearance\nof the clergyman, who comes out of the house in haste and dismay].\n\nREV. S. Frank: Mrs Warren and her daughter are coming across the heath\nwith Crofts: I saw them from the study windows. What _am_ I to say about\nyour mother?\n\nFRANK. Stick on your hat and go out and say how delighted you are to see\nthem; and that Frank's in the garden; and that mother and Bessie have\nbeen called to the bedside of a sick relative, and were ever so\nsorry they couldn't stop; and that you hope Mrs Warren slept well;\nand--and--say any blessed thing except the truth, and leave the rest to\nProvidence.\n\nREV. S. But how are we to get rid of them afterwards?\n\nFRANK. Theres no time to think of that now. Here! [He bounds into the\nhouse].\n\nREV. S. He's so impetuous. I don't know what to do with him, Mr Praed.\n\nFRANK [returning with a clerical felt hat, which he claps on his\nfather's head]. Now: off with you. [Rushing him through the gate].\nPraed and I'll wait here, to give the thing an unpremeditated air. [The\nclergyman, dazed but obedient, hurries off].\n\nFRANK. We must get the old girl back to town somehow, Praed. Come!\nHonestly, dear Praddy, do you like seeing them together?\n\nPRAED. Oh, why not?\n\nFRANK [his teeth on edge] Don't it make your flesh creep ever so little?\nthat wicked old devil, up to every villainy under the sun, I'll swear,\nand Vivie--ugh!\n\nPRAED. Hush, pray. Theyre coming.\n\n[The clergyman and Crofts are seen coming along the road, followed by\nMrs Warren and Vivie walking affectionately together.]\n\nFRANK. Look: she actually has her arm round the old woman's waist. It's\nher right arm: she began it. She's gone sentimental, by God! Ugh! ugh!\nNow do you feel the creeps? [The clergyman opens the gate: and Mrs\nWarren and Vivie pass him and stand in the middle of the garden looking\nat the house. Frank, in an ecstasy of dissimulation, turns gaily to Mrs\nWarren, exclaiming] Ever so delighted to see you, Mrs Warren. This quiet\nold rectory garden becomes you perfectly.\n\nMRS WARREN. Well, I never! Did you hear that, George? He says I look\nwell in a quiet old rectory garden.\n\nREV. S. [still holding the gate for Crofts, who loafs through it,\nheavily bored] You look well everywhere, Mrs Warren.\n\nFRANK. Bravo, gov'nor! Now look here: lets have a treat before lunch.\nFirst lets see the church. Everyone has to do that. It's a regular old\nthirteenth century church, you know: the gov'nor's ever so fond of it,\nbecause he got up a restoration fund and had it completely rebuilt six\nyears ago. Praed will be able to shew its points.\n\nPRAED [rising] Certainly, if the restoration has left any to shew.\n\nREV. S. [mooning hospitably at them] I shall be pleased, I'm sure, if\nSir George and Mrs Warren really care about it.\n\nMRS WARREN. Oh, come along and get it over.\n\nCROFTS [turning back toward the gate] I've no objection.\n\nREV. S. Not that way. We go through the fields, if you don't mind. Round\nhere. [He leads the way by the little path through the box hedge].\n\nCROFTS. Oh, all right. [He goes with the parson].\n\n[Praed follows with Mrs Warren. Vivie does not stir: she watches them\nuntil they have gone, with all the lines of purpose in her face marking\nit strongly.]\n\nFRANK. Ain't you coming?\n\nVIVIE. No. I want to give you a warning, Frank. You were making fun of\nmy mother just now when you said that about the rectory garden. That is\nbarred in the future. Please treat my mother with as much respect as you\ntreat your own.\n\nFRANK. My dear Viv: she wouldn't appreciate it: the two cases require\ndifferent treatment. But what on earth has happened to you? Last night\nwe were perfectly agreed as to your mother and her set. This morning I\nfind you attitudinizing sentimentally with your arm around your parent's\nwaist.\n\nVIVIE [flushing] Attitudinizing!\n\nFRANK. That was how it struck me. First time I ever saw you do a\nsecond-rate thing.\n\nVIVIE [controlling herself] Yes, Frank: there has been a change: but I\ndon't think it a change for the worse. Yesterday I was a little prig.\n\nFRANK. And today?\n\nVIVIE [wincing; then looking at him steadily] Today I know my mother\nbetter than you do.\n\nFRANK. Heaven forbid!\n\nVIVIE. What do you mean?\n\nFRANK. Viv: theres a freemasonry among thoroughly immoral people that\nyou know nothing of. You've too much character. _That's_ the bond\nbetween your mother and me: that's why I know her better than youll ever\nknow her.\n\nVIVIE. You are wrong: you know nothing about her. If you knew the\ncircumstances against which my mother had to struggle--\n\nFRANK [adroitly finishing the sentence for her] I should know why she is\nwhat she is, shouldn't I? What difference would that make?\n\nCircumstances or no circumstances, Viv, you won't be able to stand your\nmother.\n\nVIVIE [very angry] Why not?\n\nFRANK. Because she's an old wretch, Viv. If you ever put your arm around\nher waist in my presence again, I'll shoot myself there and then as a\nprotest against an exhibition which revolts me.\n\nVIVIE. Must I choose between dropping your acquaintance and dropping my\nmother's?\n\nFRANK [gracefully] That would put the old lady at ever such a\ndisadvantage. No, Viv: your infatuated little boy will have to stick to\nyou in any case. But he's all the more anxious that you shouldn't make\nmistakes. It's no use, Viv: your mother's impossible. She may be a good\nsort; but she's a bad lot, a very bad lot.\n\nVIVIE [hotly] Frank--! [He stands his ground. She turns away and\nsits down on the bench under the yew tree, struggling to recover her\nself-command. Then she says] Is she to be deserted by the world because\nshe's what you call a bad lot? Has she no right to live?\n\nFRANK. No fear of that, Viv: _she_ won't ever be deserted. [He sits on\nthe bench beside her].\n\nVIVIE. But I am to desert her, I suppose.\n\nFRANK [babyishly, lulling her and making love to her with his voice]\nMustn't go live with her. Little family group of mother and daughter\nwouldn't be a success. Spoil o u r little group.\n\nVIVIE [falling under the spell] What little group?\n\nFRANK. The babes in the wood: Vivie and little Frank. [He nestles\nagainst her like a weary child]. Lets go and get covered up with leaves.\n\nVIVIE [rhythmically, rocking him like a nurse] Fast asleep, hand in\nhand, under the trees.\n\nFRANK. The wise little girl with her silly little boy.\n\nVIVIE. The dear little boy with his dowdy little girl.\n\nFRANK. Ever so peaceful, and relieved from the imbecility of the little\nboy's father and the questionableness of the little girl's--\n\nVIVIE [smothering the word against her breast] Sh-sh-sh-sh! little girl\nwants to forget all about her mother. [They are silent for some moments,\nrocking one another. Then Vivie wakes up with a shock, exclaiming] What\na pair of fools we are! Come: sit up. Gracious! your hair. [She smooths\nit]. I wonder do all grown up people play in that childish way when\nnobody is looking.\n\nI never did it when I was a child.\n\nFRANK. Neither did I. You are my first playmate. [He catches her hand to\nkiss it, but checks himself to look around first. Very unexpectedly, he\nsees Crofts emerging from the box hedge]. Oh damn!\n\nVIVIE. Why damn, dear?\n\nFRANK [whispering] Sh! Here's this brute Crofts. [He sits farther away\nfrom her with an unconcerned air].\n\nCROFTS. Could I have a few words with you, Miss Vivie?\n\nVIVIE. Certainly.\n\nCROFTS [to Frank] Youll excuse me, Gardner. Theyre waiting for you in\nthe church, if you don't mind.\n\nFRANK [rising] Anything to oblige you, Crofts--except church. If you\nshould happen to want me, Vivvums, ring the gate bell. [He goes into the\nhouse with unruffled suavity].\n\nCROFTS [watching him with a crafty air as he disappears, and speaking to\nVivie with an assumption of being on privileged terms with her] Pleasant\nyoung fellow that, Miss Vivie. Pity he has no money, isn't it?\n\nVIVIE. Do you think so?\n\nCROFTS. Well, whats he to do? No profession. No property. Whats he good\nfor?\n\nVIVIE. I realize his disadvantages, Sir George.\n\nCROFTS [a little taken aback at being so precisely interpreted] Oh, it's\nnot that. But while we're in this world we're in it; and money's money.\n[Vivie does not answer]. Nice day, isn't it?\n\nVIVIE [with scarcely veiled contempt for this effort at conversation]\nVery.\n\nCROFTS [with brutal good humor, as if he liked her pluck] Well thats not\nwhat I came to say. [Sitting down beside her] Now listen, Miss Vivie.\nI'm quite aware that I'm not a young lady's man.\n\nVIVIE. Indeed, Sir George?\n\nCROFTS. No; and to tell you the honest truth I don't want to be either.\nBut when I say a thing I mean it; and when I feel a sentiment I feel it\nin earnest; and what I value I pay hard money for. Thats the sort of man\nI am.\n\nVIVIE. It does you great credit, I'm sure.\n\nCROFTS. Oh, I don't mean to praise myself. I have my faults, Heaven\nknows: no man is more sensible of that than I am. I know I'm not\nperfect: thats one of the advantages of being a middle-aged man; for\nI'm not a young man, and I know it. But my code is a simple one, and, I\nthink, a good one. Honor between man and man; fidelity between man and\nwoman; and no can't about this religion or that religion, but an honest\nbelief that things are making for good on the whole.\n\nVIVIE [with biting irony] \"A power, not ourselves, that makes for\nrighteousness,\" eh?\n\nCROFTS [taking her seriously] Oh certainly. Not ourselves, of course. Y\no u understand what I mean. Well, now as to practical matters. You may\nhave an idea that I've flung my money about; but I havn't: I'm richer\ntoday than when I first came into the property. I've used my knowledge of\nthe world to invest my money in ways that other men have overlooked; and\nwhatever else I may be, I'm a safe man from the money point of view.\n\nVIVIE. It's very kind of you to tell me all this.\n\nCROFTS. Oh well, come, Miss Vivie: you needn't pretend you don't see what\nI'm driving at. I want to settle down with a Lady Crofts. I suppose you\nthink me very blunt, eh?\n\nVIVIE. Not at all: I am very much obliged to you for being so definite\nand business-like. I quite appreciate the offer: the money, the\nposition, _Lady Crofts_, and so on. But I think I will say no, if you\ndon't mind, I'd rather not. [She rises, and strolls across to the\nsundial to get out of his immediate neighborhood].\n\nCROFTS [not at all discouraged, and taking advantage of the additional\nroom left him on the seat to spread himself comfortably, as if a few\npreliminary refusals were part of the inevitable routine of courtship]\nI'm in no hurry. It was only just to let you know in case young Gardner\nshould try to trap you. Leave the question open.\n\nVIVIE [sharply] My no is final. I won't go back from it.\n\n[Crofts is not impressed. He grins; leans forward with his elbows on his\nknees to prod with his stick at some unfortunate insect in the grass;\nand looks cunningly at her. She turns away impatiently.]\n\nCROFTS. I'm a good deal older than you. Twenty-five years: quarter of\na century. I shan't live for ever; and I'll take care that you shall be\nwell off when I'm gone.\n\nVIVIE. I am proof against even that inducement, Sir George. Don't you\nthink youd better take your answer? There is not the slightest chance of\nmy altering it.\n\nCROFTS [rising, after a final slash at a daisy, and coming nearer to\nher] Well, no matter. I could tell you some things that would change\nyour mind fast enough; but I wont, because I'd rather win you by honest\naffection. I was a good friend to your mother: ask her whether I wasn't.\nShe'd never have make the money that paid for your education if it hadnt\nbeen for my advice and help, not to mention the money I advanced her.\nThere are not many men who would have stood by her as I have. I put not\nless than forty thousand pounds into it, from first to last.\n\nVIVIE [staring at him] Do you mean to say that you were my mother's\nbusiness partner?\n\nCROFTS. Yes. Now just think of all the trouble and the explanations\nit would save if we were to keep the whole thing in the family, so to\nspeak. Ask your mother whether she'd like to have to explain all her\naffairs to a perfect stranger.\n\nVIVIE. I see no difficulty, since I understand that the business is\nwound up, and the money invested.\n\nCROFTS [stopping short, amazed] Wound up! Wind up a business thats\npaying 35 per cent in the worst years! Not likely. Who told you that?\n\nVIVIE [her color quite gone] Do you mean that it is still--? [She stops\nabruptly, and puts her hand on the sundial to support herself. Then she\ngets quickly to the iron chair and sits down].\n\nWhat business are you talking about?\n\nCROFTS. Well, the fact is it's not what would considered exactly a\nhigh-class business in my set--the country set, you know--o u r set it\nwill be if you think better of my offer. Not that theres any mystery\nabout it: don't think that. Of course you know by your mother's being\nin it that it's perfectly straight and honest. I've known her for many\nyears; and I can say of her that she'd cut off her hands sooner than\ntouch anything that was not what it ought to be. I'll tell you all about\nit if you like. I don't know whether you've found in travelling how hard\nit is to find a really comfortable private hotel.\n\nVIVIE [sickened, averting her face] Yes: go on.\n\nCROFTS. Well, thats all it is. Your mother has got a genius for managing\nsuch things. We've got two in Brussels, one in Ostend, one in Vienna,\nand two in Budapest. Of course there are others besides ourselves in\nit; but we hold most of the capital; and your mother's indispensable\nas managing director. You've noticed, I daresay, that she travels a good\ndeal. But you see you can't mention such things in society. Once let out\nthe word hotel and everybody thinks you keep a public-house. You wouldn't\nlike people to say that of your mother, would you? Thats why we're so\nreserved about it. By the way, youll keep it to yourself, won't you?\nSince it's been a secret so long, it had better remain so.\n\nVIVIE. And this is the business you invite me to join you in?\n\nCROFTS. Oh no. My wife shan't be troubled with business. Youll not be in\nit more than you've always been.\n\nVIVIE. _I_ always been! What do you mean?\n\nCROFTS. Only that you've always lived on it. It paid for your education\nand the dress you have on your back. Don't turn up your nose at business,\nMiss Vivie: where would your Newnhams and Girtons be without it?\n\nVIVIE [rising, almost beside herself] Take care. I know what this\nbusiness is.\n\nCROFTS [starting, with a suppressed oath] Who told you?\n\nVIVIE. Your partner. My mother.\n\nCROFTS [black with rage] The old--\n\nVIVIE. Just so.\n\n[He swallows the epithet and stands for a moment swearing and raging\nfoully to himself. But he knows that his cue is to be sympathetic. He\ntakes refuge in generous indignation.]\n\nCROFTS. She ought to have had more consideration for you. _I'd_ never\nhave told you.\n\nVIVIE. I think you would probably have told me when we were married: it\nwould have been a convenient weapon to break me in with.\n\nCROFTS [quite sincerely] I never intended that. On my word as a\ngentleman I didn't.\n\n[Vivie wonders at him. Her sense of the irony of his protest cools and\nbraces her. She replies with contemptuous self-possession.]\n\nVIVIE. It does not matter. I suppose you understand that when we leave\nhere today our acquaintance ceases.\n\nCROFTS. Why? Is it for helping your mother?\n\nVIVIE. My mother was a very poor woman who had no reasonable choice but\nto do as she did. You were a rich gentleman; and you did the same for\nthe sake of 35 per cent. You are a pretty common sort of scoundrel, I\nthink. That is my opinion of you.\n\nCROFTS [after a stare: not at all displeased, and much more at his ease\non these frank terms than on their former ceremonious ones] Ha! ha! ha!\nha! Go it, little missie, go it: it doesn't hurt me and it amuses you.\nWhy the devil shouldn't I invest my money that way? I take the interest\non my capital like other people: I hope you don't think I dirty my own\nhands with the work.\n\nCome! you wouldn't refuse the acquaintance of my mother's cousin the Duke\nof Belgravia because some of the rents he gets are earned in queer ways.\nYou wouldn't cut the Archbishop of Canterbury, I suppose, because the\nEcclesiastical Commissioners have a few publicans and sinners among\ntheir tenants. Do you remember your Crofts scholarship at Newnham? Well,\nthat was founded by my brother the M.P. He gets his 22 per cent out of\na factory with 600 girls in it, and not one of them getting wages enough\nto live on. How d'ye suppose they manage when they have no family to\nfall back on? Ask your mother. And do you expect me to turn my back on\n35 per cent when all the rest are pocketing what they can, like sensible\nmen? No such fool! If youre going to pick and choose your acquaintances\non moral principles, youd better clear out of this country, unless you\nwant to cut yourself out of all decent society.\n\nVIVIE [conscience stricken] You might go on to point out that I myself\nnever asked where the money I spent came from. I believe I am just as\nbad as you.\n\nCROFTS [greatly reassured] Of course you are; and a very good thing too!\nWhat harm does it do after all? [Rallying her jocularly] So you don't\nthink me such a scoundrel now you come to think it over. Eh?\n\nVIVIE. I have shared profits with you: and I admitted you just now to\nthe familiarity of knowing what I think of you.\n\nCROFTS [with serious friendliness] To be sure you did. You won't find\nme a bad sort: I don't go in for being superfine intellectually; but Ive\nplenty of honest human feeling; and the old Crofts breed comes out in\na sort of instinctive hatred of anything low, in which I'm sure youll\nsympathize with me. Believe me, Miss Vivie, the world isn't such a bad\nplace as the croakers make out. As long as you don't fly openly in the\nface of society, society doesn't ask any inconvenient questions; and\nit makes precious short work of the cads who do. There are no secrets\nbetter kept than the secrets everybody guesses. In the class of people\nI can introduce you to, no lady or gentleman would so far forget\nthemselves as to discuss my business affairs or your mothers. No man can\noffer you a safer position.\n\nVIVIE [studying him curiously] I suppose you really think youre getting\non famously with me.\n\nCROFTS. Well, I hope I may flatter myself that you think better of me\nthan you did at first.\n\nVIVIE [quietly] I hardly find you worth thinking about at all now. When\nI think of the society that tolerates you, and the laws that protect\nyou! when I think of how helpless nine out of ten young girls would\nbe in the hands of you and my mother! the unmentionable woman and her\ncapitalist bully--\n\nCROFTS [livid] Damn you!\n\nVIVIE. You need not. I feel among the damned already.\n\n[She raises the latch of the gate to open it and go out. He follows her\nand puts his hand heavily on the top bar to prevent its opening.]\n\nCROFTS [panting with fury] Do you think I'll put up with this from you,\nyou young devil?\n\nVIVIE [unmoved] Be quiet. Some one will answer the bell. [Without\nflinching a step she strikes the bell with the back of her hand. It\nclangs harshly; and he starts back involuntarily. Almost immediately\nFrank appears at the porch with his rifle].\n\nFRANK [with cheerful politeness] Will you have the rifle, Viv; or shall\nI operate?\n\nVIVIE. Frank: have you been listening?\n\nFRANK [coming down into the garden] Only for the bell, I assure you; so\nthat you shouldn't have to wait. I think I shewed great insight into your\ncharacter, Crofts.\n\nCROFTS. For two pins I'd take that gun from you and break it across your\nhead.\n\nFRANK [stalking him cautiously] Pray don't. I'm ever so careless in\nhandling firearms. Sure to be a fatal accident, with a reprimand from\nthe coroner's jury for my negligence.\n\nVIVIE. Put the rifle away, Frank: it's quite unnecessary.\n\nFRANK. Quite right, Viv. Much more sportsmanlike to catch him in a\ntrap. [Crofts, understanding the insult, makes a threatening movement].\nCrofts: there are fifteen cartridges in the magazine here; and I am a\ndead shot at the present distance and at an object of your size.\n\nCROFTS. Oh, you needn't be afraid. I'm not going to touch you.\n\nFRANK. Ever so magnanimous of you under the circumstances! Thank you.\n\nCROFTS. I'll just tell you this before I go. It may interest you, since\nyoure so fond of one another. Allow me, Mister Frank, to introduce you\nto your half-sister, the eldest daughter of the Reverend Samuel Gardner.\nMiss Vivie: you half-brother. Good morning! [He goes out through the\ngate and along the road].\n\nFRANK [after a pause of stupefaction, raising the rifle] Youll testify\nbefore the coroner that it's an accident, Viv. [He takes aim at the\nretreating figure of Crofts. Vivie seizes the muzzle and pulls it round\nagainst her breast].\n\nVIVIE. Fire now. You may.\n\nFRANK [dropping his end of the rifle hastily] Stop! take care. [She lets\nit go. It falls on the turf]. Oh, you've given your little boy such\na turn. Suppose it had gone off! ugh! [He sinks on the garden seat,\novercome].\n\nVIVIE. Suppose it had: do you think it would not have been a relief to\nhave some sharp physical pain tearing through me?\n\nFRANK [coaxingly] Take it ever so easy, dear Viv. Remember: even if the\nrifle scared that fellow into telling the truth for the first time in\nhis life, that only makes us the babes in the woods in earnest. [He\nholds out his arms to her]. Come and be covered up with leaves again.\n\nVIVIE [with a cry of disgust] Ah, not that, not that. You make all my\nflesh creep.\n\nFRANK. Why, whats the matter?\n\nVIVIE. Goodbye.

Frank comes off as resentful and childish in both cases. Praed scolds him for making fun of the Reverend Samuel Gardner, on whom he is financially dependent, and Vivie demands he show more respect to Mrs. Warren. Her attitude toward her mother has changed because, the night before, Mrs. Warren revealed her sympathetic history to her daughter. Vivie and Frank's friendship is revealed as close and flirtatious, if a bit strange. The way they flirt with each other is to pretend to be children, as if they are playing house. They admit that neither of them played this way when they actually were children, suggesting that this kind of interaction is a coping mechanism for something that was absent in their childhoods. Whereas Vivie had shut down Frank's advances the night before, now that she has reconciled with her mother, she is more open to flirting back. However, after Crofts suggests that they are half-siblings, Vivie's interest in this particular flirtation turns cold. She tells Frank, \"You make all my flesh creep\"  before leaving. Croft's marriage proposal serves to highlight the difference between Vivie's approach to marriage and that of her mother. Whereas both women reject the idea that Crofts should marry Vivie, Mrs. Warren's rejection is based in repulsion at such a commercial approach to marriage. Vivie, on the other hand, tells Crofts that she appreciates how \"business-like\"  he is about the offer. However, she rejects him based on personal preference. In this act, Crofts reveals to Vivie the rest of Mrs. Warren's secret regarding her profession: she continues to run brothels. Upon learning this new information, Vivie no longer understands her mother's point of view and judges both Mrs. Warren and Crofts harshly. In asking her to keep the secret from others, Crofts invokes convention and the judgment of others: \"Since it's been a secret so long, it had better remain so\" . The dramatic irony at play here is that Crofts does not know the damage he has just done to the relationship between Vivie and her mother by revealing the rest of this secret. The idea of morality comes into question on a large scale during Crofts argument with Vivie in this act. She accuses him of being immoral for operating brothels purely for the sake of profit. In response, he chastises her for assuming that there is any honest way to make money. He insists that everyone \"in decent society\"  operates immorally in order to maintain status. The irony of this statement is not lost on Vivie: if everyone in the upper echelons of society is immoral, how can they see themselves as above those people who, like Mrs. Warren, turn to prostitution or other \"immoral\" work to survive?","summary_length":547.0,"analysis_length":484.0,"chap_int":3,"previous summary id":[],"previous chapter":[],"next summary id":"act iii","next chapter":"The setting of Act III is the Gardner home, where Praed and Crofts have spent the night.

Mr. Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to\nbelieve \"in all this nonsense\" about an Invisible Man. His wife,\nhowever, as he was subsequently to be reminded, did. He insisted\nupon walking about his garden just as if nothing was the matter,\nand he went to sleep in the afternoon in accordance with the custom\nof years. He slept through the smashing of the windows, and then\nwoke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something wrong. He\nlooked across at Kemp's house, rubbed his eyes and looked again.\nThen he put his feet to the ground, and sat listening. He said he\nwas damned, but still the strange thing was visible. The house\nlooked as though it had been deserted for weeks--after a violent\nriot. Every window was broken, and every window, save those of the\nbelvedere study, was blinded by the internal shutters.\n\n\"I could have sworn it was all right\"--he looked at his watch--\"twenty\nminutes ago.\"\n\nHe became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass,\nfar away in the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a\nstill more wonderful thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window\nwere flung open violently, and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and\ngarments, appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the\nsash. Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping her--Dr. Kemp!\nIn another moment the window was open, and the housemaid was\nstruggling out; she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs.\nMr. Heelas stood up, exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these\nwonderful things. He saw Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the\nwindow, and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in\nthe shrubbery and stooping as he ran, like a man who evades\nobservation. He vanished behind a laburnum, and appeared again\nclambering over a fence that abutted on the open down. In a second\nhe had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the\nslope towards Mr. Heelas.\n\n\"Lord!\" cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; \"it's that Invisible\nMan brute! It's right, after all!\"\n\nWith Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook\nwatching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting\ntowards the house at a good nine miles an hour. There was a\nslamming of doors, a ringing of bells, and the voice of Mr. Heelas\nbellowing like a bull. \"Shut the doors, shut the windows, shut\neverything!--the Invisible Man is coming!\" Instantly the house was\nfull of screams and directions, and scurrying feet. He ran himself\nto shut the French windows that opened on the veranda; as he did so\nKemp's head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the\ngarden fence. In another moment Kemp had ploughed through the\nasparagus, and was running across the tennis lawn to the house.\n\n\"You can't come in,\" said Mr. Heelas, shutting the bolts. \"I'm very\nsorry if he's after you, but you can't come in!\"\n\nKemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and\nthen shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his\nefforts were useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end,\nand went to hammer at the side door. Then he ran round by the side\ngate to the front of the house, and so into the hill-road. And Mr.\nHeelas staring from his window--a face of horror--had scarcely\nwitnessed Kemp vanish, ere the asparagus was being trampled this\nway and that by feet unseen. At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately\nupstairs, and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview. But as\nhe passed the staircase window, he heard the side gate slam.\n\nEmerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward\ndirection, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very\nrace he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere\nstudy only four days ago. He ran it well, for a man out of\ntraining, and though his face was white and wet, his wits were cool\nto the last. He ran with wide strides, and wherever a patch of\nrough ground intervened, wherever there came a patch of raw flints,\nor a bit of broken glass shone dazzling, he crossed it and left the\nbare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would.\n\nFor the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road\nwas indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the\ntown far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had\nthere been a slower or more painful method of progression than\nrunning. All the gaunt villas, sleeping in the afternoon sun,\nlooked locked and barred; no doubt they were locked and barred--by\nhis own orders. But at any rate they might have kept a lookout\nfor an eventuality like this! The town was rising up now, the sea\nhad dropped out of sight behind it, and people down below were\nstirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill foot. Beyond that\nwas the police station. Was that footsteps he heard behind him?\nSpurt.\n\nThe people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and\nhis breath was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite\nnear now, and the \"Jolly Cricketers\" was noisily barring its doors.\nBeyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravel--the drainage\nworks. He had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and\nslamming the doors, and then he resolved to go for the police\nstation. In another moment he had passed the door of the \"Jolly\nCricketers,\" and was in the blistering fag end of the street, with\nhuman beings about him. The tram driver and his helper--arrested\nby the sight of his furious haste--stood staring with the tram\nhorses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of navvies\nappeared above the mounds of gravel.\n\nHis pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his\npursuer, and leapt forward again. \"The Invisible Man!\" he cried to\nthe navvies, with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration\nleapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the\nchase. Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned\ninto a little side street, rushed by a greengrocer's cart,\nhesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff\nshop, and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into\nthe main Hill Street again. Two or three little children were\nplaying here, and shrieked and scattered at his apparition, and\nforthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed\ntheir hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street again, three hundred\nyards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became aware of a\ntumultuous vociferation and running people.\n\nHe glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off\nran a huge navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with\na spade, and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists\nclenched. Up the street others followed these two, striking and\nshouting. Down towards the town, men and women were running, and he\nnoticed clearly one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in\nhis hand. \"Spread out! Spread out!\" cried some one. Kemp suddenly\ngrasped the altered condition of the chase. He stopped, and looked\nround, panting. \"He's close here!\" he cried. \"Form a line across--\"\n\nHe was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face\nround towards his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his\nfeet, and he struck a vain counter in the air. Then he was hit\nagain under the jaw, and sprawled headlong on the ground. In\nanother moment a knee compressed his diaphragm, and a couple of\neager hands gripped his throat, but the grip of one was weaker than\nthe other; he grasped the wrists, heard a cry of pain from his\nassailant, and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through\nthe air above him, and struck something with a dull thud. He felt\na drop of moisture on his face. The grip at his throat suddenly\nrelaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed himself, grasped\na limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the unseen elbows\nnear the ground. \"I've got him!\" screamed Kemp. \"Help! Help--hold!\nHe's down! Hold his feet!\"\n\nIn another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle,\nand a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an\nexceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And\nthere was no shouting after Kemp's cry--only a sound of blows\nand feet and heavy breathing.\n\nThen came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple\nof his antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in\nfront like a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched,\nand tore at the Unseen. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck\nand shoulders and lugged him back.\n\nDown went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There\nwas, I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream\nof \"Mercy! Mercy!\" that died down swiftly to a sound like choking.\n\n\"Get back, you fools!\" cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there\nwas a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. \"He's hurt, I tell\nyou. Stand back!\"\n\nThere was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of\neager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches\nin the air, and holding invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a\nconstable gripped invisible ankles.\n\n\"Don't you leave go of en,\" cried the big navvy, holding a\nblood-stained spade; \"he's shamming.\"\n\n\"He's not shamming,\" said the doctor, cautiously raising his knee;\n\"and I'll hold him.\" His face was bruised and already going red; he\nspoke thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and\nseemed to be feeling at the face. \"The mouth's all wet,\" he said.\nAnd then, \"Good God!\"\n\nHe stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side\nof the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of\nheavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of\nthe crowd. People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of\nthe \"Jolly Cricketers\" stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said.\n\nKemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. \"He's\nnot breathing,\" he said, and then, \"I can't feel his heart. His\nside--ugh!\"\n\nSuddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy,\nscreamed sharply. \"Looky there!\" she said, and thrust out a\nwrinkled finger.\n\nAnd looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent\nas though it was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and\nbones and nerves could be distinguished, the outline of a hand, a\nhand limp and prone. It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared.\n\n\"Hullo!\" cried the constable. \"Here's his feet a-showing!\"\n\nAnd so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along\nhis limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change\ncontinued. It was like the slow spreading of a poison. First came\nthe little white nerves, a hazy grey sketch of a limb, then the\nglassy bones and intricate arteries, then the flesh and skin, first\na faint fogginess, and then growing rapidly dense and opaque.\nPresently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders, and\nthe dim outline of his drawn and battered features.\n\nWhen at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay,\nnaked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a\nyoung man about thirty. His hair and brow were white--not grey\nwith age, but white with the whiteness of albinism--and his eyes\nwere like garnets. His hands were clenched, his eyes wide open, and\nhis expression was one of anger and dismay.\n\n\"Cover his face!\" said a man. \"For Gawd's sake, cover that face!\"\nand three little children, pushing forward through the crowd, were\nsuddenly twisted round and sent packing off again.\n\nSomeone brought a sheet from the \"Jolly Cricketers,\" and having\ncovered him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on\na shabby bed in a tawdry, ill-lighted bedroom, surrounded by a crowd\nof ignorant and excited people, broken and wounded, betrayed and\nunpitied, that Griffin, the first of all men to make himself\ninvisible, Griffin, the most gifted physicist the world has ever\nseen, ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible career.\n\n\n\nTHE EPILOGUE\n\n\nSo ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the\nInvisible Man. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a\nlittle inn near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord. The sign of\nthe inn is an empty board save for a hat and boots, and the name is\nthe title of this story. The landlord is a short and corpulent\nlittle man with a nose of cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a\nsporadic rosiness of visage. Drink generously, and he will tell you\ngenerously of all the things that happened to him after that time,\nand of how the lawyers tried to do him out of the treasure found\nupon him.\n\n\"When they found they couldn't prove whose money was which, I'm\nblessed,\" he says, \"if they didn't try to make me out a blooming\ntreasure trove! Do I _look_ like a Treasure Trove? And then a\ngentleman gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the Empire\nMusic 'All--just to tell 'em in my own words--barring one.\"\n\nAnd if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly,\nyou can always do so by asking if there weren't three manuscript\nbooks in the story. He admits there were and proceeds to explain,\nwith asseverations that everybody thinks _he_ has 'em! But bless you!\nhe hasn't. \"The Invisible Man it was took 'em off to hide 'em when\nI cut and ran for Port Stowe. It's that Mr. Kemp put people on with\nthe idea of _my_ having 'em.\"\n\nAnd then he subsides into a pensive state, watches you furtively,\nbustles nervously with glasses, and presently leaves the bar.\n\nHe is a bachelor man--his tastes were ever bachelor, and there\nare no women folk in the house. Outwardly he buttons--it is\nexpected of him--but in his more vital privacies, in the matter\nof braces for example, he still turns to string. He conducts his\nhouse without enterprise, but with eminent decorum. His movements\nare slow, and he is a great thinker. But he has a reputation for\nwisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village, and his\nknowledge of the roads of the South of England would beat Cobbett.\n\nAnd on Sunday mornings, every Sunday morning, all the year round,\nwhile he is closed to the outer world, and every night after ten,\nhe goes into his bar parlour, bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged\nwith water, and having placed this down, he locks the door and\nexamines the blinds, and even looks under the table. And then,\nbeing satisfied of his solitude, he unlocks the cupboard and a box\nin the cupboard and a drawer in that box, and produces three\nvolumes bound in brown leather, and places them solemnly in the\nmiddle of the table. The covers are weather-worn and tinged with an\nalgal green--for once they sojourned in a ditch and some of the\npages have been washed blank by dirty water. The landlord sits down\nin an armchair, fills a long clay pipe slowly--gloating over the\nbooks the while. Then he pulls one towards him and opens it, and\nbegins to study it--turning over the leaves backwards and forwards.\n\nHis brows are knit and his lips move painfully. \"Hex, little two up\nin the air, cross and a fiddle-de-dee. Lord! what a one he was for\nintellect!\"\n\nPresently he relaxes and leans back, and blinks through his smoke\nacross the room at things invisible to other eyes. \"Full of\nsecrets,\" he says. \"Wonderful secrets!\"\n\n\"Once I get the haul of them--_Lord_!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do what _he_ did; I'd just--well!\" He pulls at his\npipe.\n\nSo he lapses into a dream, the undying wonderful dream of his life.\nAnd though Kemp has fished unceasingly, no human being save the\nlandlord knows those books are there, with the subtle secret of\ninvisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein.\nAnd none other will know of them until he dies.\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2564.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 28","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210126034801\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/invisible-man-wells\/summary\/chapter-28","summary_text":"Before now, Kemp's neighbor, Heelas, didn't believe in the Invisible Man.

This is day one of year one of the new epoch--the Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am Invisible Man the First\" . The letter also says that Griffin will kill Kemp that day. No big deal. What's even better is that Griffin sent that letter without a stamp, so Kemp had to pay for it upon delivery. As we said, worst letter ever. Kemp has his housekeeper lock up all the windows and gets his revolver ready. He writes a note for Adye, saying that Kemp will act as bait to catch Griffin. Adye shows up later, saying that Griffin grabbed the note from Kemp's servant. So now Griffin knows that Kemp wants to set a trap. Bummer. Then Griffin does what he does best: he breaks some windows. But there's no way for him to get into Kemp's house because they've anticipated his arrival. This is the siege of Kemp's house. Adye borrows Kemp's gun and tries to go for help, but Griffin trips him up and grabs the gun. At first, Adye refuses to help Griffin, but he changes his mind when he realizes \"that life was very sweet\" . The narrator switches point-of-view here, and goes from Adye to Kemp, who is watching all this from an upstairs window. Suddenly, he sees Adye attack Griffin and get shot. It sure looks like Adye is dead, but we're not sure. Kemp's housemaid is coming up the hill with two policemen. At the same time, Griffin has found an axe and is using it to break through the shutters over a window. This is what we call suspense. Luckily for Kemp, the police get there in time, and he gives them some fireplace pokers to use as clubs. So it's pokers vs. axe-and-revolver, though Griffin isn't a great shot. Griffin knocks out one of the cops, but the other cop hurts Griffin . There's a snapping sound, so maybe his arm gets broken. Griffin drops his weapons and runs away. But when the cops look around, they find that Kemp and his housemaid have also run away. That probably doesn't make them feel too great about the guy they just saved."],"next summary id":"chapter 28","next chapter":"Before now, Kemp's neighbor, Heelas, didn't believe in the Invisible Man. But when he wakes up from a nap and sees Kemp's house broken into and Kemp running toward him, Heelas does the only sensible thing: he locks himself inside his house and refuses to help his neighbor. From Heelas's point-of-view, we see Kemp run through the garden followed closely by the Invisible Man. Kemp continues running towards Burdock . It sounds something like a nightmare: the road is long and empty, and no one in the nearby houses will help him. Still, when Kemp arrives in Burdock, he finds a couple of workmen on the road. When he yells about the Invisible Man, everyone nearby tries to find and hit the IM - shovels and all. When the Invisible Man grabs Kemp, the navvies knock the Invisible Man down. So maybe these guys are the real heroes of the book? The narrator notes that the next scene might have looked like a game of rugby, but it was actually a big fight between the crowd and the Invisible Man. Spoiler alert: the Invisible Man loses. \"There was, I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of 'Mercy! Mercy!' that died down swiftly to a sound like choking\" . Kemp tries to get people off of Griffin, but the IM is already not breathing and possibly dead. Everyone crowds around to see what happened, and slowly, the Invisible Man starts to become visible : Cool. And horrible. That's how Griffin's experiment in invisibility ends, with people covering up his \"naked and pitiful\" body ."}

They greet each other, and note that it's strange that one of the servants has been sent to collect money from Timon, while his master wears enormous jewels recently given him by Timon. The servants find it odd that Timon's friends should demand their loans paid back when they still enjoy Timon's gifts. The servants know their lords have sucked up Timon's bounty and now, even worse, have no gratitude for the generosity he showed them in days past. Flaminius and Flavius enter, and the servants demand to know the whereabouts of Timon. Flavius asks them why they didn't bring out their bills of debt due when their lords were enjoying the bounty of Timon's table, instead of presenting them when Timon's luck has turned. Flavius angrily departs. Servilius enters, and the servants assault him with questions, but he explains that Timon has been taken ill. Yet Timon bursts from the house in a rage. He shouts angrily that he has always been free, why should he now be constrained within his house, why now is mankind so cruel to him? Each of the creditor's servants then present their bills, swarming around him. Timon is horrified, and rushes back inside the house, while the servants wonder if their masters may be better off giving up on collecting their money. Inside the house, Timon speaks to Flavius, and suddenly thinks of a plan. He orders Flavius to organize another feast. Flavius says no money remains for a feast, but Timon tells him not to worry. He sends Flavius to invite everyone. Meanwhile in the Senate House, several senators discuss the fate of a man. Alcibiades enters and pleads for his friend. His friend, he says, is an honorable man who acted foolishly out of passion, and asks that he be freed. One senator replies that Alcibiades speaks as if he's trying to make manslaughter legal. Revenge is not a valorous action; rather, learning to bear slights and suffering is preferable, says the senator. Alcibiades then speaks as a soldier, to whom slights mean action. If bearing suffering is valorous, does that mean prisoners are wiser than those who judge them? Alcibiades begs that they consider his friend acted rashly, but doesn't everyone sometimes do the same? The senators say Alcibiades's efforts are in vain. Alcibiades insists that his friend's actions for Athens on the battlefield should be sufficient payment for his freedom. The senators condemn Alcibiades's friend to death, but Alcibiades offers his own achievements as further barter for his friend. The law, he declares, is just as strict as war, and they both have succeeded at war. Alcibiades begs them to reconsider his requests. But the senators are now provoked, and they banish Alcibiades. Alcibiades, alone, is enraged. He has fought hard for Athens, only to be banished. He says he's nearly glad to leave Athens, for now he can gather his troops and strike at Athens. Soldiers should not endure such wrongs, he declares.\", \"analysis\": \"Commentary The servants outside Timon's door all appear to have more capacity for pity than any of their masters, for they all remark on the injustice of their masters calling Timon's bills due, when the loans originated to pay for gifts for their masters. Yet Timon's former friends ignore Timon's kind intentions, they forget his gifts, and turn on him. Yet even though the servants seem to understand the injustice of Timon's position, they still swamp him with their bills and drive him into his house! Timon plans to confront his former friends by throwing another feast, a feast that will be memorably different from the bounty and generosity that marked his prior festivities. Timon had at first believed his friends would help him through rough times, but when they refused, his rage was provoked. Learning swiftly from his mistakes, he becomes a wholly different man. The secondary plot of Alcibiades's banishment is not well developed; apparently a friend of his has killed someone in what appears to have been a momentary rage, and has been sentenced to death. But while arguing for his release, Alcibiades annoys the senators to the point of banishing him. Alcibiades declares that he will raise an army to take Athens, which will prove helpful to Timon's cause later in the play. Alcibiades too has been one of Timon's friends, but apparently his involvement in this trial hinders any aid he might have offered to Timon, until later.\"}","chapter":"SCENE IV.\nA hall in TIMON'S house\n\nEnter two Of VARRO'S MEN, meeting LUCIUS' SERVANT, and others,\nall being servants of TIMON's creditors, to wait for his coming\nout.\nThen enter TITUS and HORTENSIUS\n\n  FIRST VARRO'S SERVANT.

Exeunt\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\nThe Senate House\n\nEnter three SENATORS at one door, ALCIBIADES meeting them, with\nattendants\n\n  FIRST SENATOR. My lord, you have my voice to't: the fault's\nbloody.\n    'Tis necessary he should die:\n    Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.\n  SECOND SENATOR. Most true; the law shall bruise him.\n  ALCIBIADES. Honour, health, and compassion, to the Senate!\n  FIRST SENATOR. Now, Captain?\n  ALCIBIADES. I am an humble suitor to your virtues;\n    For pity is the virtue of the law,\n    And none but tyrants use it cruelly.\n    It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy\n    Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood\n    Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth\n    To those that without heed do plunge into't.\n    He is a man, setting his fate aside,\n    Of comely virtues;\n    Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice-\n    An honour in him which buys out his fault-\n    But with a noble fury and fair spirit,\n    Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,\n    He did oppose his foe;\n    And with such sober and unnoted passion\n    He did behove his anger ere 'twas spent,\n    As if he had but prov'd an argument.\n  FIRST SENATOR. You undergo too strict a paradox,\n    Striving to make an ugly deed look fair;\n    Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd\n    To bring manslaughter into form and set\n    Quarrelling upon the head of valour; which, indeed,\n    Is valour misbegot, and came into the world\n    When sects and factions were newly born.\n    He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer\n    The worst that man can breathe,\n    And make his wrongs his outsides,\n    To wear them like his raiment, carelessly,\n    And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,\n    To bring it into danger.\n    If wrongs be evils, and enforce us kill,\n    What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!\n  ALCIBIADES. My lord-\n  FIRST SENATOR. You cannot make gross sins look clear:\n    To revenge is no valour, but to bear.\n  ALCIBIADES. My lords, then, under favour, pardon me\n    If I speak like a captain:\n    Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,\n    And not endure all threats? Sleep upon't,\n    And let the foes quietly cut their throats,\n    Without repugnancy? If there be\n    Such valour in the bearing, what make we\n    Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant,\n    That stay at home, if bearing carry it;\n    And the ass more captain than the lion; the fellow\n    Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,\n    If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,\n    As you are great, be pitifully good.\n    Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?\n    To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;\n    But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.\n    To be in anger is impiety;\n    But who is man that is not angry?\n    Weigh but the crime with this.\n  SECOND SENATOR. You breathe in vain.\n  ALCIBIADES. In vain! His service done\n    At Lacedaemon and Byzantium\n    Were a sufficient briber for his life.\n  FIRST SENATOR. What's that?\n  ALCIBIADES. Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service,\n    And slain in fight many of your enemies;\n    How full of valour did he bear himself\n    In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!\n  SECOND SENATOR. He has made too much plenty with 'em.\n    He's a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often\n    Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner.\n    If there were no foes, that were enough\n    To overcome him. In that beastly fury\n    He has been known to commit outrages\n    And cherish factions. 'Tis inferr'd to us\n    His days are foul and his drink dangerous.\n  FIRST SENATOR. He dies.\n  ALCIBIADES. Hard fate! He might have died in war.\n    My lords, if not for any parts in him-\n    Though his right arm might purchase his own time,\n    And be in debt to none- yet, more to move you,\n    Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both;\n    And, for I know your reverend ages love\n    Security, I'll pawn my victories, all\n    My honours to you, upon his good returns.\n    If by this crime he owes the law his life,\n    Why, let the war receive't in valiant gore;\n    For law is strict, and war is nothing more.\n  FIRST SENATOR. We are for law: he dies. Urge it no more\n    On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother,\n    He forfeits his own blood that spills another.\n  ALCIBIADES. Must it be so? It must not be. My lords,\n    I do beseech you, know me.\n  SECOND SENATOR. How!\n  ALCIBIADES. Call me to your remembrances.\n  THIRD SENATOR. What!\n  ALCIBIADES. I cannot think but your age has forgot me;\n    It could not else be I should prove so base\n    To sue, and be denied such common grace.\n    My wounds ache at you.\n  FIRST SENATOR. Do you dare our anger?\n    'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:\n    We banish thee for ever.\n  ALCIBIADES. Banish me!\n    Banish your dotage! Banish usury\n    That makes the Senate ugly.\n  FIRST SENATOR. If after two days' shine Athens contain thee,\n    Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell our spirit,\n    He shall be executed presently.              Exeunt SENATORS\n  ALCIBIADES. Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live\n    Only in bone, that none may look on you!\n    I'm worse than mad; I have kept back their foes,\n    While they have told their money and let out\n    Their coin upon large interest, I myself\n    Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?\n    Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate\n    Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!\n    It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;\n    It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,\n    That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up\n    My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.\n    'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;\n    Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.         Exit\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\nA banqueting hall in TIMON'S house\n\nMusic. Tables set out; servants attending. Enter divers LORDS,\nfriends of TIMON, at several doors\n\n  FIRST LORD. The good time of day to you, sir.\n  SECOND LORD. I also wish it to you. I think this honourable\nlord\n    did but try us this other day.\n  FIRST LORD. Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we\nencount'red.\n    I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the\ntrial\n    of his several friends.\n  SECOND LORD. It should not be, by the persuasion of his new\n    feasting.\n  FIRST LORD. I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest\ninviting,\n    which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he\nhath\n    conjur'd me beyond them, and I must needs appear.\n  SECOND LORD. In like manner was I in debt to my importunate\n    business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when\nhe\n    sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.\n  FIRST LORD. I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how\nall\n    things go.\n  SECOND LORD. Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed\nof\n    you?\n  FIRST LORD. A thousand pieces.\n  SECOND LORD. A thousand pieces!\n  FIRST LORD. What of you?\n  SECOND LORD. He sent to me, sir- here he comes.\n\n                   Enter TIMON and attendants\n\n  TIMON. With all my heart, gentlemen both! And how fare you?\n  FIRST LORD. Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.\n  SECOND LORD. The swallow follows not summer more willing than\nwe\n    your lordship.\n  TIMON. [Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such\nsummer-birds\n    are men- Gentlemen, our dinner will not recompense this long\n    stay; feast your ears with the music awhile, if they will\nfare so\n    harshly o' th' trumpet's sound; we shall to't presently.\n  FIRST LORD. I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship\nthat\n    I return'd you an empty messenger.\n  TIMON. O sir, let it not trouble you.\n  SECOND LORD. My noble lord-\n  TIMON. Ah, my good friend, what cheer?\n  SECOND LORD. My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame\nthat,\n    when your lordship this other day sent to me, I was so\n    unfortunate a beggar.\n  TIMON. Think not on't, sir.\n  SECOND LORD. If you had sent but two hours before-\n  TIMON. Let it not cumber your better remembrance. [The banquet\n    brought in] Come, bring in all together.\n  SECOND LORD. All cover'd dishes!\n  FIRST LORD. Royal cheer, I warrant you.\n  THIRD LORD. Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield\nit.\n  FIRST LORD. How do you? What's the news?\n  THIRD LORD. Alcibiades is banish'd. Hear you of it?\n  FIRST AND SECOND LORDS. Alcibiades banish'd!\n  THIRD LORD. 'Tis so, be sure of it.\n  FIRST LORD. How? how?\n  SECOND LORD. I pray you, upon what?\n  TIMON. My worthy friends, will you draw near?\n  THIRD LORD. I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast\ntoward.\n  SECOND LORD. This is the old man still.\n  THIRD LORD. Will't hold? Will't hold?\n  SECOND LORD. It does; but time will- and so-\n  THIRD LORD. I do conceive.\n  TIMON. Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the\nlip\n    of his mistress; your diet shall be in all places alike. Make\nnot\n    a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree\nupon\n    the first place. Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks:\n\n    You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with\nthankfulness.\n    For your own gifts make yourselves prais'd; but reserve still\nto\n    give, lest your deities be despised. Lend to each man enough,\n    that one need not lend to another; for were your god-heads to\n    borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be\n    beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of\n    twenty be without a score of villains. If there sit twelve\nwomen\n    at the table, let a dozen of them be- as they are. The rest\nof\n    your foes, O gods, the senators of Athens, together with the\n    common lag of people, what is amiss in them, you gods, make\n    suitable for destruction.

Flaminius and Flavius enter, and the servants demand to know the whereabouts of Timon. Flavius asks them why they didn't bring out their bills of debt due when their lords were enjoying the bounty of Timon's table, instead of presenting them when Timon's luck has turned. Flavius angrily departs. Servilius enters, and the servants assault him with questions, but he explains that Timon has been taken ill. Yet Timon bursts from the house in a rage. He shouts angrily that he has always been free, why should he now be constrained within his house, why now is mankind so cruel to him? Each of the creditor's servants then present their bills, swarming around him. Timon is horrified, and rushes back inside the house, while the servants wonder if their masters may be better off giving up on collecting their money. Inside the house, Timon speaks to Flavius, and suddenly thinks of a plan. He orders Flavius to organize another feast. Flavius says no money remains for a feast, but Timon tells him not to worry. He sends Flavius to invite everyone. Meanwhile in the Senate House, several senators discuss the fate of a man. Alcibiades enters and pleads for his friend. His friend, he says, is an honorable man who acted foolishly out of passion, and asks that he be freed. One senator replies that Alcibiades speaks as if he's trying to make manslaughter legal. Revenge is not a valorous action; rather, learning to bear slights and suffering is preferable, says the senator. Alcibiades then speaks as a soldier, to whom slights mean action. If bearing suffering is valorous, does that mean prisoners are wiser than those who judge them? Alcibiades begs that they consider his friend acted rashly, but doesn't everyone sometimes do the same? The senators say Alcibiades's efforts are in vain. Alcibiades insists that his friend's actions for Athens on the battlefield should be sufficient payment for his freedom. The senators condemn Alcibiades's friend to death, but Alcibiades offers his own achievements as further barter for his friend. The law, he declares, is just as strict as war, and they both have succeeded at war. Alcibiades begs them to reconsider his requests. But the senators are now provoked, and they banish Alcibiades. Alcibiades, alone, is enraged. He has fought hard for Athens, only to be banished. He says he's nearly glad to leave Athens, for now he can gather his troops and strike at Athens. Soldiers should not endure such wrongs, he declares.","summary_analysis":"Commentary The servants outside Timon's door all appear to have more capacity for pity than any of their masters, for they all remark on the injustice of their masters calling Timon's bills due, when the loans originated to pay for gifts for their masters. Yet Timon's former friends ignore Timon's kind intentions, they forget his gifts, and turn on him. Yet even though the servants seem to understand the injustice of Timon's position, they still swamp him with their bills and drive him into his house! Timon plans to confront his former friends by throwing another feast, a feast that will be memorably different from the bounty and generosity that marked his prior festivities. Timon had at first believed his friends would help him through rough times, but when they refused, his rage was provoked. Learning swiftly from his mistakes, he becomes a wholly different man. The secondary plot of Alcibiades's banishment is not well developed; apparently a friend of his has killed someone in what appears to have been a momentary rage, and has been sentenced to death. But while arguing for his release, Alcibiades annoys the senators to the point of banishing him. Alcibiades declares that he will raise an army to take Athens, which will prove helpful to Timon's cause later in the play. Alcibiades too has been one of Timon's friends, but apparently his involvement in this trial hinders any aid he might have offered to Timon, until later.","summary_length":512.0,"analysis_length":243.0,"chap_int":6,"previous summary id":["scene 5"],"previous chapter":["The scene opens with the conversation between the Senator and Alcibiades.

Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we\nencount'red.\n    I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the\ntrial\n    of his several friends.\n  SECOND LORD. It should not be, by the persuasion of his new\n    feasting.\n  FIRST LORD. I should think so.

In like manner was I in debt to my importunate\n    business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when\nhe\n    sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.\n  FIRST LORD. I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how\nall\n    things go.\n  SECOND LORD. Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed\nof\n    you?\n  FIRST LORD. A thousand pieces.\n  SECOND LORD.

They peer out the window in curiosity at the two men. The girls notice that the men haven't followed them into the house and are eating muffins. They're worried that the guys don't seem to be noticing them at all. A moment later, when the two guys start walking toward the house, the women are affronted and agree to give them the silent treatment. But that soon falls apart. Cecily breaks her silence to ask Algernon why he pretended to be Jack's brother. He answers candidly--to \\\"have an opportunity of meeting you\\\" . Cecily melts. Then it's Gwendolen's turn. She asks Jack why he pretended to have a brother. Before he can answer, she suggests that it was possibly so that he could have an excuse to come up to town to see her as often as possible. He confirms it. Satisfied, the girls forgive the men. But there's a still a problem. The girls confront the guys in loud unison: \\\"Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all!\\\" . In other words, the girls can't possibly marry them if their names aren't Ernest. In response, the men answer in unison: \\\"Our Christian names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon\\\" . Seeing that their beloveds are brave enough to endure such a harrowing ordeal as a christening for their sake, the women rush into their lovers' arms. Merriman enters, sees all the hugging going on, and coughs loudly. He announces the arrival of Lady Bracknell. The startled couples separate. Lady Bracknell loses no time in asking Gwendolen just what she's doing. At the news that she's engaged to Jack, Lady Bracknell turns her wrath on him. She orders that all communication between them must stop immediately and ignores his protests. Then she turns to Algernon and asks if this is where Bunbury resides. Caught by surprise, Algernon answers no, then stutters that Bunbury is actually dead. He died by exploding. Lady Bracknell is appalled by his method of death, considering it a \\\"revolutionary outrage\\\" , but is glad that the matter is settled. Onto business. Lady Bracknell asks Jack who is that young person holding Algernon's hand so inappropriately. When she learns Algernon is engaged to Cecily, she comments that there must be something in the air here that is particularly exciting. Because the number of engagements here \\\"seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance\\\" . Slyly, she asks if Miss Cardew has any relations to the railway stations in London. Jack is fuming, but coldly answers no and recites Cecily's proper parents, plus their address. He assures her that she can find the same information in the Court Guides. And he lists off all the documentation he has of Cecily--including birth certificates, baptism records, incidents of illness, and vaccinations. Lady Bracknell brushes him off, telling Gwendolen it's time to leave. As they exit, she asks offhand if Miss Cardew has any amount of fortune. Oh, Jack answers, just a hundred and thirty thousand pounds. Lady Bracknell freezes. Suddenly, Cecily looks much more attractive to her. With Cecily's eager cooperation, Lady Bracknell inspects her profile and declares she has \\\"distinct social possibilities\\\" . Finally, she gives her consent. She even allows Cecily to call her Aunt Augusta. But Jack has other ideas. As Cecily's legal guardian, he refuses to give consent for her to marry Algernon. When Lady Bracknell, insulted, asks what could possibly be wrong with Algernon, Jack reveals that Algernon has lied--deceiving his whole family into thinking he was the nonexistent younger brother, Ernest. On top of that, Jack continues, he not only drank an entire bottle of his best wine, but also ate every single muffin at tea. Jack stands by his verdict; he won't give Algernon consent to marry Cecily. Lady Bracknell, however, has hope. After learning Cecily is eighteen, Lady Bracknell says it won't be long before she comes of age and she can make her own decisions. But Jack interrupts, saying her grandfather's will dictates she won't come of age until she's thirty-five. Although Lady Bracknell doesn't think the wait is that bad, Cecily is impatient and declares she can't wait that long. Finally, Jack deigns to negotiate: if Lady Bracknell will give consent for him to marry Gwendolen, he'll consent to let Algernon marry Cecily. Lady Bracknell flatly refuses and tells Gwendolen to get ready to go. They've already missed five trains back to town. Dr. Chasuble enters at this crucial moment to announce that everything is ready for the christenings. Lady Bracknell will not hear of such nonsense. Jack sadly agrees to call off the christenings, because there's no point now. Nobody is getting married. This news saddens Dr. Chasuble, but he's glad to have some free time this evening. He's heard that Miss Prism has been waiting for him in the vestry. Lady Bracknell starts at the name. Apparently they have a history. Jack tries to explain that Miss Prism is Cecily's esteemed governess. But this has no impact on Lady Bracknell. She orders Chasuble to send for Miss Prism at once. At the sight of the stern Lady Bracknell, Miss Prism stops dead in her tracks, and turns around with the intention of running away. Prism! Lady Bracknell spits. Miss Prism approaches humbly. Lady Bracknell recites Prism's crime: twenty-eight years ago, Miss Prism left Lord Bracknell's house with a perambulator containing a male child. Both of them disappeared without a trace. Weeks later, the police found the perambulator in Bayswater with an especially sappy three-volume novel inside. But the baby was gone. Prism, Lady Bracknell screeches, where is that baby? Shamed, Miss Prism confesses. She doesn't know where the child is, but she tells what happened the best she can. On that fateful day, she not only had the baby in the perambulator with her, but the prized three-volume novel she had written, contained in an old hangbag. Later that day, she got confused and accidentally put the book into the perambulator and the baby into the handbag. Jack, who's been listening intently, asks where she sent the handbag. Miss Prism confesses she deposited it at a cloakroom in Victoria Station , the Brighton line. At this news, Jack runs up to his room, leaving the others baffled. It sounds like things are being frantically thrown around. After some time, Jack returns with a black leather handbag. He asks Miss Prism to inspect it and decide whether or not it's the one she owned. After a few moments, Miss Prism declares that it is indeed hers. She points to the lock, which is engraved with her initials, as proof. Jack smiles and reveals that he was the baby inside the handbag. Then he impulsively hugs Miss Prism, screaming in joy, \\\"Mother!\\\" . But Miss Prism recoils, saying that she is not married. How could he dare insinuate such a thing? But Jack is in a generous mood and forgives her, only to hug her again. Stunned, Miss Prism detaches herself and points to Lady Bracknell. That woman, she says, can tell you who you really are. Lady Bracknell delivers the stunning news. \\\"You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother\\\" . Jack is beside himself with joy, glad because this means that he had been telling the truth all these years; he does indeed have a younger brother. He grabs Algy and goes around the room, introducing each and every person to his \\\"unfortunate brother,\\\" Algernon. Gwendolen finally asks the question that's been on our minds. What is Jack's real name? He must remember that his marriage depends on it. Jack turns to Lady Bracknell for the answer. She answers that he was indeed christened, and--as befits the eldest son--was named after his father. But, unfortunately, she cannot remember the General's name. Neither can Algy, because their father died when he was a baby. But Jack has an idea. His father's name would appear in the Army Lists, wouldn't it? Jack turns to the bookcase and tears out volumes until he finds the Army List he wants. He flips through the M's until he finds the Moncrieff entry. He reads out the Christian name: Ernest John. He shuts the book and turns to Gwendolen with the suspenseful news that his name really is Ernest. He hasn't been lying after all. Lady Bracknell now remembers that the General's name was Ernest. She knew she had a reason for disliking that name. This clears the way for a love-fest. Gwendolen rushes into Jack's arms. Dr. Chasuble embraces Miss Prism . Algernon sweeps Cecily off her feet. There's general chaotic joy. When Lady Bracknell tries to put a damper on things by saying Jack is \\\"displaying signs of triviality\\\" , Jack replies suavely that, on the contrary, \\\"I've now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"THIRD ACT\n\n\nSCENE\n\n\nMorning-room at the Manor House.\n\n[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]\n\nGwendolen.  The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house,\nas any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some\nsense of shame left.\n\nCecily.  They have been eating muffins.  That looks like repentance.\n\nGwendolen.  [After a pause.]  They don't seem to notice us at all.\nCouldn't you cough?\n\nCecily.  But I haven't got a cough.\n\nGwendolen.  They're looking at us.  What effrontery!\n\nCecily.  They're approaching.  That's very forward of them.\n\nGwendolen.  Let us preserve a dignified silence.\n\nCecily.  Certainly.  It's the only thing to do now.  [Enter Jack followed\nby Algernon.  They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British\nOpera.]\n\nGwendolen.  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\n\nCecily.  A most distasteful one.\n\nGwendolen.  But we will not be the first to speak.\n\nCecily.  Certainly not.\n\nGwendolen.  Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.\nMuch depends on your reply.\n\nCecily.  Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.  Mr. Moncrieff,\nkindly answer me the following question.  Why did you pretend to be my\nguardian's brother?\n\nAlgernon.  In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\n\nCecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  That certainly seems a satisfactory\nexplanation, does it not?\n\nGwendolen.  Yes, dear, if you can believe him.\n\nCecily.  I don't.  But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his\nanswer.\n\nGwendolen.  True.  In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity\nis the vital thing.  Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me\nfor pretending to have a brother?  Was it in order that you might have an\nopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\n\nJack.  Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGwendolen.  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.  But I intend to\ncrush them.  This is not the moment for German scepticism.  [Moving to\nCecily.]  Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially\nMr. Worthing's.  That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\n\nCecily.  I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.  His voice\nalone inspires one with absolute credulity.\n\nGwendolen.  Then you think we should forgive them?\n\nCecily.  Yes.  I mean no.\n\nGwendolen.  True!  I had forgotten.  There are principles at stake that\none cannot surrender.  Which of us should tell them?  The task is not a\npleasant one.\n\nCecily.  Could we not both speak at the same time?\n\nGwendolen.  An excellent idea!  I nearly always speak at the same time as\nother people.  Will you take the time from me?\n\nCecily.  Certainly.  [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\n\nGwendolen and Cecily [Speaking together.]  Your Christian names are still\nan insuperable barrier.  That is all!\n\nJack and Algernon [Speaking together.]  Our Christian names!  Is that\nall?  But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\n\nGwendolen.  [To Jack.]  For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible\nthing?\n\nJack.  I am.\n\nCecily.  [To Algernon.]  To please me you are ready to face this fearful\nordeal?\n\nAlgernon.  I am!\n\nGwendolen.  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  Where\nquestions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\n\nJack.  We are.  [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\n\nCecily.  They have moments of physical courage of which we women know\nabsolutely nothing.\n\nGwendolen.  [To Jack.]  Darling!\n\nAlgernon.  [To Cecily.]  Darling!  [They fall into each other's arms.]\n\n[Enter Merriman.  When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the situation.]\n\nMerriman.  Ahem!  Ahem!  Lady Bracknell!\n\nJack.  Good heavens!\n\n[Enter Lady Bracknell.  The couples separate in alarm.  Exit Merriman.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Gwendolen!  What does this mean?\n\nGwendolen.  Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing,\nmamma.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Come here.  Sit down.  Sit down immediately.  Hesitation\nof any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness\nin the old.  [Turns to Jack.]  Apprised, sir, of my daughter's sudden\nflight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a\nsmall coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train.  Her unhappy\nfather is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending a\nmore than usually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on\nthe Influence of a permanent income on Thought.  I do not propose to\nundeceive him.  Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.  I\nwould consider it wrong.  But of course, you will clearly understand that\nall communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately\nfrom this moment.  On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.\n\nJack.  I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!\n\nLady Bracknell.  You are nothing of the kind, sir.  And now, as regards\nAlgernon! . . . Algernon!\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid\nfriend Mr. Bunbury resides?\n\nAlgernon.  [Stammering.]  Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunbury\nis somewhere else at present.  In fact, Bunbury is dead.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Dead!  When did Mr. Bunbury die?  His death must have\nbeen extremely sudden.\n\nAlgernon.  [Airily.]  Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poor\nBunbury died this afternoon.\n\nLady Bracknell.  What did he die of?\n\nAlgernon.  Bunbury?  Oh, he was quite exploded.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Exploded!  Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?\nI was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.  If\nso, he is well punished for his morbidity.\n\nAlgernon.  My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!  The doctors\nfound out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean--so Bunbury\ndied.\n\nLady Bracknell.  He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of\nhis physicians.  I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last\nto some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.\nAnd now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.\nWorthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now\nholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\n\nJack.  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.  [Lady Bracknell bows\ncoldly to Cecily.]\n\nAlgernon.  I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  I beg your pardon?\n\nCecily.  Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.]\nI do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of\nthis particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that\ngo on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics\nhave laid down for our guidance.  I think some preliminary inquiry on my\npart would not be out of place.  Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all\nconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London?  I merely\ndesire information.  Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any\nfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus.  [Jack looks perfectly\nfurious, but restrains himself.]\n\nJack.  [In a clear, cold voice.]  Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of\nthe late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park,\nDorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That sounds not unsatisfactory.  Three addresses always\ninspire confidence, even in tradesmen.  But what proof have I of their\nauthenticity?\n\nJack.  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.  They\nare open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Grimly.]  I have known strange errors in that\npublication.\n\nJack.  Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and\nMarkby.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Markby, Markby, and Markby?  A firm of the very highest\nposition in their profession.  Indeed I am told that one of the Mr.\nMarkby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.  So far I am\nsatisfied.\n\nJack.  [Very irritably.]  How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!  I\nhave also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of\nMiss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination,\nconfirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps\nsomewhat too exciting for a young girl.  I am not myself in favour of\npremature experiences.  [Rises, looks at her watch.]  Gwendolen! the time\napproaches for our departure.  We have not a moment to lose.  As a matter\nof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little\nfortune?\n\nJack.  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.  That\nis all.  Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.  So pleased to have seen you.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A\nhundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems\nto me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.  Few girls of\nthe present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities\nthat last, and improve with time.  We live, I regret to say, in an age of\nsurfaces.  [To Cecily.]  Come over here, dear.  [Cecily goes across.]\nPretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as\nNature might have left it.  But we can soon alter all that.  A thoroughly\nexperienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very\nbrief space of time.  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,\nand after three months her own husband did not know her.\n\nJack.  And after six months nobody knew her.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Glares at Jack for a few moments.  Then bends, with a\npractised smile, to Cecily.]  Kindly turn round, sweet child.  [Cecily\nturns completely round.]  No, the side view is what I want.  [Cecily\npresents her profile.]  Yes, quite as I expected.  There are distinct\nsocial possibilities in your profile.  The two weak points in our age are\nits want of principle and its want of profile.  The chin a little higher,\ndear.  Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.  They are worn\nvery high, just at present.  Algernon!\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta!\n\nLady Bracknell.  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's\nprofile.\n\nAlgernon.  Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole\nworld.  And I don't care twopence about social possibilities.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only\npeople who can't get into it do that.  [To Cecily.]  Dear child, of\ncourse you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.\nBut I do not approve of mercenary marriages.  When I married Lord\nBracknell I had no fortune of any kind.  But I never dreamed for a moment\nof allowing that to stand in my way.  Well, I suppose I must give my\nconsent.\n\nAlgernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Cecily, you may kiss me!\n\nCecily.  [Kisses her.]  Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\n\nCecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\n\nAlgernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nCecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long\nengagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each\nother's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\nJack.  I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this\nengagement is quite out of the question.  I am Miss Cardew's guardian,\nand she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.  That\nconsent I absolutely decline to give.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Upon what grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely,\nI may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.  He has nothing,\nbut he looks everything.  What more can one desire?\n\nJack.  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady\nBracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at\nall of his moral character.  I suspect him of being untruthful.  [Algernon\nand Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Untruthful!  My nephew Algernon?  Impossible!  He is an\nOxonian.\n\nJack.  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This\nafternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question\nof romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false\npretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I've just\nbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,\nBrut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing his\ndisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in\nalienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to\ntea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct all\nthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first\nthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don't\nintend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so\nmyself yesterday afternoon.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have\ndecided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.\n\nJack.  That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.  My own decision,\nhowever, is unalterable.  I decline to give my consent.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [To Cecily.]  Come here, sweet child.  [Cecily goes\nover.]  How old are you, dear?\n\nCecily.  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty\nwhen I go to evening parties.\n\nLady Bracknell.  You are perfectly right in making some slight\nalteration.  Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her\nage.  It looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.]  Eighteen,\nbut admitting to twenty at evening parties.  Well, it will not be very\nlong before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  So\nI don't think your guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of any\nimportance.\n\nJack.  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it\nis only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather's\nwill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty-\nfive is a very attractive age.  London society is full of women of the\nvery highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-\nfive for years.  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.  To my own\nknowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of\nforty, which was many years ago now.  I see no reason why our dear Cecily\nshould not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she\nis at present.  There will be a large accumulation of property.\n\nCecily.  Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\n\nAlgernon.  Of course I could, Cecily.  You know I could.\n\nCecily.  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.\nI hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rather\ncross.  I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in\nothers, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\n\nAlgernon.  Then what is to be done, Cecily?\n\nCecily.  I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.\n\nLady Bracknell.  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively\nthat she cannot wait till she is thirty-five--a remark which I am bound\nto say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature--I would beg of\nyou to reconsider your decision.\n\nJack.  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own\nhands.  The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most\ngladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Rising and drawing herself up.]  You must be quite\naware that what you propose is out of the question.\n\nJack.  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward\nto.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.\nAlgernon, of course, can choose for himself.  [Pulls out her watch.]\nCome, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six,\ntrains.  To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.\n\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nChasuble.  Everything is quite ready for the christenings.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?\n\nChasuble.  [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.]\nBoth these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\n\nLady Bracknell.  At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!\nAlgernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses.\nLord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the\nway in which you wasted your time and money.\n\nChasuble.  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings\nat all this afternoon?\n\nJack.  I don't think that, as things are now, it would be of much\npractical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\n\nChasuble.  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.\nThey savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have\ncompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.  However, as your\npresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the\nchurch at once.  Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that\nfor the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the\nvestry.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Starting.]  Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss\nPrism?\n\nChasuble.  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I am on my way to join her.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  This matter\nmay prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.  Is\nthis Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with\neducation?\n\nChasuble.  [Somewhat indignantly.]  She is the most cultivated of ladies,\nand the very picture of respectability.\n\nLady Bracknell.  It is obviously the same person.  May I ask what\nposition she holds in your household?\n\nChasuble.  [Severely.]  I am a celibate, madam.\n\nJack.  [Interposing.]  Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last\nthree years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.\n\nLady Bracknell.  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.\nLet her be sent for.\n\nChasuble.  [Looking off.]  She approaches; she is nigh.\n\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\n\nMiss Prism.  I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.  I\nhave been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.  [Catches\nsight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.  Miss\nPrism grows pale and quails.  She looks anxiously round as if desirous to\nescape.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  [In a severe, judicial voice.]  Prism!  [Miss Prism bows\nher head in shame.]  Come here, Prism!  [Miss Prism approaches in a\nhumble manner.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [General consternation.  The\nCanon starts back in horror.  Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to\nshield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public\nscandal.]  Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's\nhouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator\nthat contained a baby of the male sex.  You never returned.  A few weeks\nlater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,\nthe perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a\nremote corner of Bayswater.  It contained the manuscript of a\nthree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.  [Miss\nPrism starts in involuntary indignation.]  But the baby was not there!\n[Every one looks at Miss Prism.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [A pause.]\n\nMiss Prism.  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.  I\nonly wish I did.  The plain facts of the case are these.  On the morning\nof the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I\nprepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  I had also\nwith me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to\nplace the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my\nfew unoccupied hours.  In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I\nnever can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette,\nand placed the baby in the hand-bag.\n\nJack.  [Who has been listening attentively.]  But where did you deposit\nthe hand-bag?\n\nMiss Prism.  Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\n\nJack.  Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.  I\ninsist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that\ninfant.\n\nMiss Prism.  I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway\nstations in London.\n\nJack.  What railway station?\n\nMiss Prism.  [Quite crushed.]  Victoria.  The Brighton line.  [Sinks into\na chair.]\n\nJack.  I must retire to my room for a moment.  Gwendolen, wait here for\nme.\n\nGwendolen.  If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my\nlife.  [Exit Jack in great excitement.]\n\nChasuble.  What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\n\nLady Bracknell.  I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble.  I need hardly\ntell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not\nsupposed to occur.  They are hardly considered the thing.\n\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.  Every\none looks up.]\n\nCecily.  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\n\nChasuble.  Your guardian has a very emotional nature.\n\nLady Bracknell.  This noise is extremely unpleasant.  It sounds as if he\nwas having an argument.  I dislike arguments of any kind.  They are\nalways vulgar, and often convincing.\n\nChasuble.  [Looking up.]  It has stopped now.  [The noise is redoubled.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\n\nGwendolen.  This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.  [Enter Jack\nwith a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\n\nJack.  [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]  Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?\nExamine it carefully before you speak.  The happiness of more than one\nlife depends on your answer.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Calmly.]  It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it\nreceived through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and\nhappier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of\na temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  And\nhere, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in an\nextravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedly\nmine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has\nbeen a great inconvenience being without it all these years.\n\nJack.  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism, more is restored to you than\nthis hand-bag.  I was the baby you placed in it.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Amazed.]  You?\n\nJack.  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother!\n\nMiss Prism.  [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I am\nunmarried!\n\nJack.  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.  But after all,\nwho has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?  Cannot\nrepentance wipe out an act of folly?  Why should there be one law for\nmen, and another for women?  Mother, I forgive you.  [Tries to embrace\nher again.]\n\nMiss Prism.  [Still more indignant.]  Mr. Worthing, there is some error.\n[Pointing to Lady Bracknell.]  There is the lady who can tell you who you\nreally are.\n\nJack.  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but\nwould you kindly inform me who I am?\n\nLady Bracknell.  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not\naltogether please you.  You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs.\nMoncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother.\n\nJack.  Algy's elder brother!  Then I have a brother after all.  I knew I\nhad a brother!  I always said I had a brother!  Cecily,--how could you\nhave ever doubted that I had a brother?  [Seizes hold of Algernon.]  Dr.\nChasuble, my unfortunate brother.  Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.\nGwendolen, my unfortunate brother.  Algy, you young scoundrel, you will\nhave to treat me with more respect in the future.  You have never behaved\nto me like a brother in all your life.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.  I did my best,\nhowever, though I was out of practice.\n\n[Shakes hands.]\n\nGwendolen.  [To Jack.]  My own!  But what own are you?  What is your\nChristian name, now that you have become some one else?\n\nJack.  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point.  Your\ndecision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\n\nGwendolen.  I never change, except in my affections.\n\nCecily.  What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\n\nJack.  Then the question had better be cleared up at once.  Aunt Augusta,\na moment.  At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I\nbeen christened already?\n\nLady Bracknell.  Every luxury that money could buy, including\nchristening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\n\nJack.  Then I was christened!  That is settled.  Now, what name was I\ngiven?  Let me know the worst.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after\nyour father.\n\nJack.  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at the present moment recall\nwhat the General's Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one.\nHe was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was the\nresult of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other\nthings of that kind.\n\nJack.  Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?\n\nAlgernon.  My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  He died\nbefore I was a year old.\n\nJack.  His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose,\nAunt Augusta?\n\nLady Bracknell.  The General was essentially a man of peace, except in\nhis domestic life.  But I have no doubt his name would appear in any\nmilitary directory.\n\nJack.

They peer out the window in curiosity at the two men. The girls notice that the men haven't followed them into the house and are eating muffins. They're worried that the guys don't seem to be noticing them at all. A moment later, when the two guys start walking toward the house, the women are affronted and agree to give them the silent treatment. But that soon falls apart. Cecily breaks her silence to ask Algernon why he pretended to be Jack's brother. He answers candidly--to \"have an opportunity of meeting you\" . Cecily melts. Then it's Gwendolen's turn. She asks Jack why he pretended to have a brother. Before he can answer, she suggests that it was possibly so that he could have an excuse to come up to town to see her as often as possible. He confirms it. Satisfied, the girls forgive the men. But there's a still a problem. The girls confront the guys in loud unison: \"Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all!\" . In other words, the girls can't possibly marry them if their names aren't Ernest. In response, the men answer in unison: \"Our Christian names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon\" . Seeing that their beloveds are brave enough to endure such a harrowing ordeal as a christening for their sake, the women rush into their lovers' arms. Merriman enters, sees all the hugging going on, and coughs loudly. He announces the arrival of Lady Bracknell. The startled couples separate. Lady Bracknell loses no time in asking Gwendolen just what she's doing. At the news that she's engaged to Jack, Lady Bracknell turns her wrath on him. She orders that all communication between them must stop immediately and ignores his protests. Then she turns to Algernon and asks if this is where Bunbury resides. Caught by surprise, Algernon answers no, then stutters that Bunbury is actually dead. He died by exploding. Lady Bracknell is appalled by his method of death, considering it a \"revolutionary outrage\" , but is glad that the matter is settled. Onto business. Lady Bracknell asks Jack who is that young person holding Algernon's hand so inappropriately. When she learns Algernon is engaged to Cecily, she comments that there must be something in the air here that is particularly exciting. Because the number of engagements here \"seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance\" . Slyly, she asks if Miss Cardew has any relations to the railway stations in London. Jack is fuming, but coldly answers no and recites Cecily's proper parents, plus their address. He assures her that she can find the same information in the Court Guides. And he lists off all the documentation he has of Cecily--including birth certificates, baptism records, incidents of illness, and vaccinations. Lady Bracknell brushes him off, telling Gwendolen it's time to leave. As they exit, she asks offhand if Miss Cardew has any amount of fortune. Oh, Jack answers, just a hundred and thirty thousand pounds. Lady Bracknell freezes. Suddenly, Cecily looks much more attractive to her. With Cecily's eager cooperation, Lady Bracknell inspects her profile and declares she has \"distinct social possibilities\" . Finally, she gives her consent. She even allows Cecily to call her Aunt Augusta. But Jack has other ideas. As Cecily's legal guardian, he refuses to give consent for her to marry Algernon. When Lady Bracknell, insulted, asks what could possibly be wrong with Algernon, Jack reveals that Algernon has lied--deceiving his whole family into thinking he was the nonexistent younger brother, Ernest. On top of that, Jack continues, he not only drank an entire bottle of his best wine, but also ate every single muffin at tea. Jack stands by his verdict; he won't give Algernon consent to marry Cecily. Lady Bracknell, however, has hope. After learning Cecily is eighteen, Lady Bracknell says it won't be long before she comes of age and she can make her own decisions. But Jack interrupts, saying her grandfather's will dictates she won't come of age until she's thirty-five. Although Lady Bracknell doesn't think the wait is that bad, Cecily is impatient and declares she can't wait that long. Finally, Jack deigns to negotiate: if Lady Bracknell will give consent for him to marry Gwendolen, he'll consent to let Algernon marry Cecily. Lady Bracknell flatly refuses and tells Gwendolen to get ready to go. They've already missed five trains back to town. Dr. Chasuble enters at this crucial moment to announce that everything is ready for the christenings. Lady Bracknell will not hear of such nonsense. Jack sadly agrees to call off the christenings, because there's no point now. Nobody is getting married. This news saddens Dr. Chasuble, but he's glad to have some free time this evening. He's heard that Miss Prism has been waiting for him in the vestry. Lady Bracknell starts at the name. Apparently they have a history. Jack tries to explain that Miss Prism is Cecily's esteemed governess. But this has no impact on Lady Bracknell. She orders Chasuble to send for Miss Prism at once. At the sight of the stern Lady Bracknell, Miss Prism stops dead in her tracks, and turns around with the intention of running away. Prism! Lady Bracknell spits. Miss Prism approaches humbly. Lady Bracknell recites Prism's crime: twenty-eight years ago, Miss Prism left Lord Bracknell's house with a perambulator containing a male child. Both of them disappeared without a trace. Weeks later, the police found the perambulator in Bayswater with an especially sappy three-volume novel inside. But the baby was gone. Prism, Lady Bracknell screeches, where is that baby? Shamed, Miss Prism confesses. She doesn't know where the child is, but she tells what happened the best she can. On that fateful day, she not only had the baby in the perambulator with her, but the prized three-volume novel she had written, contained in an old hangbag. Later that day, she got confused and accidentally put the book into the perambulator and the baby into the handbag. Jack, who's been listening intently, asks where she sent the handbag. Miss Prism confesses she deposited it at a cloakroom in Victoria Station , the Brighton line. At this news, Jack runs up to his room, leaving the others baffled. It sounds like things are being frantically thrown around. After some time, Jack returns with a black leather handbag. He asks Miss Prism to inspect it and decide whether or not it's the one she owned. After a few moments, Miss Prism declares that it is indeed hers. She points to the lock, which is engraved with her initials, as proof. Jack smiles and reveals that he was the baby inside the handbag. Then he impulsively hugs Miss Prism, screaming in joy, \"Mother!\" . But Miss Prism recoils, saying that she is not married. How could he dare insinuate such a thing? But Jack is in a generous mood and forgives her, only to hug her again. Stunned, Miss Prism detaches herself and points to Lady Bracknell. That woman, she says, can tell you who you really are. Lady Bracknell delivers the stunning news. \"You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother\" . Jack is beside himself with joy, glad because this means that he had been telling the truth all these years; he does indeed have a younger brother. He grabs Algy and goes around the room, introducing each and every person to his \"unfortunate brother,\" Algernon. Gwendolen finally asks the question that's been on our minds. What is Jack's real name? He must remember that his marriage depends on it. Jack turns to Lady Bracknell for the answer. She answers that he was indeed christened, and--as befits the eldest son--was named after his father. But, unfortunately, she cannot remember the General's name. Neither can Algy, because their father died when he was a baby. But Jack has an idea. His father's name would appear in the Army Lists, wouldn't it? Jack turns to the bookcase and tears out volumes until he finds the Army List he wants. He flips through the M's until he finds the Moncrieff entry. He reads out the Christian name: Ernest John. He shuts the book and turns to Gwendolen with the suspenseful news that his name really is Ernest. He hasn't been lying after all. Lady Bracknell now remembers that the General's name was Ernest. She knew she had a reason for disliking that name. This clears the way for a love-fest. Gwendolen rushes into Jack's arms. Dr. Chasuble embraces Miss Prism . Algernon sweeps Cecily off her feet. There's general chaotic joy. When Lady Bracknell tries to put a damper on things by saying Jack is \"displaying signs of triviality\" , Jack replies suavely that, on the contrary, \"I've now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\"","summary_analysis":null,"summary_length":1509.0,"analysis_length":1.0,"chap_int":3,"previous summary id":["act ii"],"previous chapter":["The setting is the garden in the Manor House--Jack's country estate. It's July. A table full of books is set up beneath a yew tree in the rose garden. Miss Prism is sitting at the table while Cecily is in the back, watering the flowers. Miss Prism calls to Cecily to stop doing such a mundane task as watering the flowers because she needs to do her German grammar lesson. Cecily argues that she doesn't want to because she knows she looks plain after her German lesson. Miss Prism retorts that Uncle Jack is only looking out for Cecily's education. Cecily complains that Uncle Jack is so serious. Miss Prism defends him as the pinnacle of \"duty and responsibility\" . She adds that he's even helping out that unfortunately troublesome younger brother of his. This piques Cecily's interest and she wishes aloud that Uncle Jack would bring Ernest by sometime so that Miss Prism could reform him. She begins writing in her diary, where she keeps all the \"wonderful secrets of life\" . At this, Miss Prism comments that she was once a writer herself. She wrote a three-volume novel back in the day. Miss Prism tells Cecily to work on her lesson. But the perfect excuse to ignore the lesson is just arriving--Dr. Chasuble. At the sight of him, Miss Prism blushes and stands. They're so obviously crushing on each other that Cecily finds it easy to persuade them to take a walk together. While they're out, Merriman the butler tells Cecily that a Mr. Ernest Worthing has just arrived. Cecily is overjoyed to finally be able to meet the infamous Ernest, but she's scared at the same time. Algernon enters, disguised as Ernest. He greets his \"cousin,\" Cici. They talk about how \"wicked\" he is, with Cecily making comments about how he should reform himself. Charmingly, Algernon\/Ernest asks Cecily to try to reform him that very afternoon. As they're flirting and Ernest is finding every way possible to compliment Cecily, like asking for a pink rose for his button-hole \"because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily\" . Algernon learns that Jack plans to send Ernest to Australia. As Cecily's putting a flower into his buttonhole, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return, discussing the moral advantages and disadvantages of marriage. They're so wrapped up in each other that they don't realize that Cecily is not where they left her. Before they can send out a search party, Jack arrives home, dressed in a black suit of mourning. When they ask him about it, Jack announces that he's returned early because his brother Ernest is dead. He died last night in Paris of a \"severe chill.\" When Dr. Chasuble offers to perform a funeral ceremony for Ernest, Jack suddenly remembers something. He asks Dr. Chasuble if he can be christened. After some questions, Dr. Chasuble relents and they arrange for Jack to come by at half-past five that evening. Cecily comes from the house to meet her Uncle Jack with the happy news that his brother Ernest arrived just recently and is now in the dining-room. Jack is completely confused. Dr. Chasuble--trying to smooth over the awkward situation--says that these are good tidings indeed . The mystery is solved when Jack sees Algernon sitting at the table. Jack refuses to shake hands with Algernon. We learn from Cecily that Ernest has been telling her about his poor friend, Mr. Bunbury. Finally, Cecily declares she will never speak to Uncle Jack again if he doesn't shake hands with Ernest. Jack gives in reluctantly and Miss Prism praises Cecily for her wonderful act of kindness today. They leave Jack and Ernest together. Furiously, Jack tells Algy to leave at once. But he's interrupted when Merriman comes in to reveal that Mr. Ernest's luggage has been put in the bedroom next to Jack's. Jack tells Merriman that unfortunately Ernest's dog-cart has arrived to take him away; he's been called back to town. While Jack rants at Algernon, Algernon talks about how pretty Cecily is. Jack declares the dog-cart is here and leaves, just in time to miss Algy's comment that he has fallen in love with Cecily. Cecily appears with a watering can in her hand. She and Ernest\/Algernon exchange glances. She pleads with Merriman to let Ernest stay for another five minutes. Algernon informs her that Jack is sending him away and compliments her beauty. Flattered, Cecily begins copying his words down in her diary, but refuses to let him look at it. When the dog-cart comes again, Ernest tells it to come again next week. Without ceremony, he asks Cecily to marry him. She responds amusedly that they've been engaged for months. She confides her past fantasies to him, as they're written in her diary. Apparently, Ernest proposed on Valentine's day but they'd broken it off a month later. Now they're back together, which she can prove with the many love letters from him that she has saved . Ernest kisses her for being so forgiving. Then she confides that it's always been a \"girlish dream of mine to love someone whose name was Ernest\" . Distraught, he asks her if she could love him under any other name... say... Algernon, for instance. Cecily finds it a rather aristocratic name, but no, she wouldn't be able to love him then. At that declaration, Ernest\/Algernon promptly begins asking her about the rector and whether or not he performs christenings. Algernon leaves to find Dr. Chasuble about a very important matter. As he leaves, Cecily comments that she likes his hair so much. Soon, Merriman enters to tell Cecily that a Miss Fairfax has arrived to see Mr. Worthing. Cecily invites Miss Fairfax to sit with her until Uncle Jack comes out. They're both such charming girls that when they meet, they declare they'll be best friends and call each other immediately by their first names. They talk for a little while before Gwendolen works up the balls to ask Cecily if she can inspect her. Gwendolen, peering through her glasses, finds Cecily rather too attractive and loudly wishes that she were a bit older and more decidedly more dowdy. She asks about Cici's relations and finds out that Mr. Worthing is Cecily's guardian. Now that's problematic, Gwendolen says, since Ernest never mentioned it to her. When Cecily hears the name Ernest, she quickly explains the situation. It's not Ernest Worthing who is my guardian, she says sweetly, but his older brother, Jack. That's a relief to Gwendolen, who suddenly becomes polite again. Cecily proudly declares that she's going to be Ernest Worthing's wife. Gwendolen rises to her feet. Excuse me? You're mistaken. Ernest proposed to me yesterday. Cecily retorts that he must've changed his mind because he just proposed to her ten minutes ago. The two women eye each other coldly before Gwendolen announces--alluding to Cecily's rude manners--that they obviously move in different social circles. Right before they can start clawing at each other, Merriman comes by to arrange their tea things. The girls bite back their acidic words in his presence. As Merriman serves them, they glare at each other but chitchat in cordial tones. However, their small talk bristles with little insults, mostly about the superiority of urban life vs. the superiority of country life . When Cecily serves Gwendolen tea, she serves it in the opposite manner that Gwendolen requests--giving her lots of sugar in her tea and cake instead of bread and butter. Thank goodness, Jack arrives just in time to break up their fight. When Gwendolen jumps on him and asks if he's to be married to Cecily, Jack laughs it off and kisses Gwendolen. The truth comes out. Cecily replies that he's not Ernest Worthing; that's Uncle Jack. At the unglamorous name, Gwendolen recoils in disgust. Right on cue, Algernon enters and Cecily goes through the same routine with him. When he confirms he's not to be married to Gwendolen, she allows him to kiss her. This time it's Gwendolen's turn to clear up the confusion. She reveals that he's not Ernest Worthing; it's Algernon Moncrieff, her cousin. Cecily backs away when she hears \"Algernon.\" The two women embrace each other in distress, while the men hang their heads in shame. They finally ask Jack who Ernest is and he is forced to admit that Ernest doesn't exist. When both girls realize with horror that neither of them are engaged to Ernest, they agree to go into the house where the men won't dare to follow them. With scornful looks, they leave. Infuriated and frustrated, the two men turn on each other for the horrible results of their Bunburying. Both blame each other for deceiving the girls. They argue for a while and Algernon sits down agitatedly and begins to eat the muffins left by the ladies. Jack comments that it's heartless for him to eat so calmly when they're in such a state and begins fighting with him over the muffins. In the midst of their squabbling, each discovers that the other has a christening to attend that evening to be named Ernest. Their christenings are scheduled only fifteen minutes apart! Both try to dissuade each other from doing so, without success. The act ends with both guys still munching muffins and bickering with each other."],"next summary id":"act iii","next chapter":"Gwendolen and Cecily are seeking sanctuary in the morning room at the Manor House.

If they do, the ladies intend to be cold and heartless. The men do come in and start explaining why they lied about their names. The women accept their explanations but still have a problem with them lacking the name Ernest. Both men proclaim that they plan to be rechristened, and Gwendolen and Cecily forgive them, and both couples embrace. Merriman discretely coughs to signal the entrance of Lady Bracknell. She desires an explanation for these hugs, and Gwendolen tells her that she is engaged to Jack. Lady Bracknell says that they are not engaged and insists that they cease all communication. She inquires about Algernon's invalid friend, Bunbury, and Algernon explains that he killed him that afternoon; Bunbury exploded. He also adds that he and Cecily are engaged. Immediately, Lady Bracknell interrogates Jack about Cecily's expectations. However, because she has a fortune of 130,000 pounds, Lady Bracknell believes her to have \\\"distinct social possibilities.\\\" Lady Bracknell gives her consent to Algernon's engagement, but Jack immediately objects as Cecily's guardian. He says that Algernon is a liar and lists all the lies he has told. Also, Cecily does not come into her fortune and lose Jack as a guardian until she is 35 years old. Algernon says he can wait, but Cecily says she cannot. So Jack, in a moment of brilliance, declares that he will agree to the marriage if Lady Bracknell will consent to his engagement to Gwendolen. That is out of the question, and Lady Bracknell prepares to leave with Gwendolen. Dr. Chasuble arrives and announces that he is ready for the christenings. Jack replies that they are useless now, and Chasuble decides to head back to the church where Miss Prism is waiting. The name Prism shocks Lady Bracknell, and she demands to see the governess. When Miss Prism arrives, she sees Lady Bracknell and turns pale. In a moment of great coincidence, Lady Bracknell reveals that Miss Prism left Lord Bracknell's house 28 years ago. On a normal walk with the baby carriage, she disappeared, along with the baby. She demands to know where the baby is. Prism explains that in a moment of great distraction, she placed the baby in her handbag and her three-volume, manuscript in the baby carriage. The baby and handbag were accidentally left in the train station. When she discovered her error, she abandoned the baby carriage and disappeared. Jack excitedly asks her which station it was, and when she reveals that it was Victoria Station, the Brighton Line, he runs from the room and returns with a black leather bag. When Prism identifies it, he embraces her, believing her to be his mother. She protests that she is not married and says that he will have to ask Lady Bracknell for the identity of his mother. Jack discovers that he is actually the son of Lady Bracknell's sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and that Algy is his older brother. Jack is overcome to know that he really does have an unfortunate scoundrel for a brother. He asks what his christened name was, and Lady Bracknell explains that it is Ernest John. So, Jack asserts that he had been speaking the truth all along: His name is Ernest, and he does have a brother. Both couples embrace, as do Chasuble and Miss Prism, and Jack declares that he finally realizes the importance of being earnest.\", \"analysis\": \"Act III offers happy resolution to the problems of identity and marriage that drive much of the humor in the previous acts. Wilde continues to mock the social customs and attitudes of the aristocratic class. He relentlessly attacks their values, views on marriage and respectability, sexual attitudes, and concern for stability in the social structure. Wilde attacks social behavior with the continuation of speeches by his characters that are the opposite of their actions. While Cecily and Gwendolen agree to keep a dignified silence, Gwendolen actually states that they will not be the first ones to speak to the men. In the very next line she says, \\\"Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.\\\" Wilde seems to be saying that people speak as if they have strong opinions, but their actions do not support their words. If actions truly do speak louder than words, Wilde has made his point: Society, literally, speaks volumes, but the words are meaningless. Wilde continues his criticism of society's valuing style over substance when Gwendolen says, \\\"In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.\\\" Lady Bracknell discusses Algernon's marriage assets in the same light. She says, \\\"Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?\\\" Indeed, in a society where looks are everything and substance is discounted, Algernon is the perfect husband. What else do aristocrats value? They seem to esteem the appearance of respectability. Respectability means children are born within the context of marriage. Wilde once again mocks the hypocrisy of the aristocrats who appear to value monogamy but pretend not to notice affairs. Jack's speech to Miss Prism, whom he believes to be his mother, is humorous in both its indignant defense of marriage and also its mocking of the loudly touted religious reformer's virtues of repentance and forgiveness. He says to Miss Prism, \\\"Unmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow.... Mother, I forgive you.\\\" His words are all the more humorous when Miss Prism indignantly denies being his mother. It was not at all unusual for aristocrats to have children born out of wedlock, but society turned its head, pretended not to know about those children, and did not condemn their fathers. The gulf between the upper class and its servants is explored in the scenes with Merriman and Prism. When Lady Bracknell unexpectedly shows up at Jack's, Merriman coughs discretely to warn the couples of her arrival. One can only imagine his humorous thoughts as he watches the wealthy tiptoe around each other and argue about what should be important. When Lady Bracknell hears the description of Prism and recognizes her as their former nanny, she calls for Miss Prism by shouting \\\"Prism!\\\" without using a title in front of her name. Imperiously, Lady Bracknell divides the servant from the lady of the manor. Wilde's audience would recognize this behavior on the part of the servants and the upper class. The stuffy class distinctions defined the society in which they lived. In an age of social registers, Lady Bracknell laments that even the Court Guides have errors. In the next breath, she discusses bribing Gwendolen's maid to find out what is happening in her daughter's life. In Act III she also reveals that her aristocratic brother's family entrusted their most precious possession -- Jack -- to a woman who is more interested in her handbag and manuscript than in what happens to the baby in her charge. Wilde seems to be questioning the values of a society that believes in social registers, hires other people to neglectfully watch its children, and uses bribery to keep track of the children who are not missing. The death of Bunbury gives Wilde the opportunity to speak of aristocratic fears and have some continued fun with the upper class's lack of compassion about death. The 1885 Trafalgar Square riots brought on ruling-class fears of insurrection, anarchism and socialism. Wilde humorously touches on these fears when he allows Algernon to explain the explosion of Bunbury. Lady Bracknell, fearing the worst, exclaims, \\\"Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is well punished for his morbidity.\\\" Evidently, to Lady Bracknell's acquaintances, laws that protect the welfare of those less fortunate are strictly morbid subjects. In fact, this attitude seems to contradict the upper-class concern for reform. However, in reality, Wilde is confirming the upper-class definition of social reform: conforming to the status quo. In Act III Wilde makes a comment on the value of being homosexual with a veiled reference to Lady Lancing. When Lady Bracknell asserts that Cecily needs to have a more sophisticated hairstyle, she recommends \\\"a thoroughly experienced French maid\\\" who can make a great deal of change in a very short time. She explains that such a change happened to an acquaintance of hers, Lady Lancing, and that after three months \\\"her own husband did not know her.\\\" Jack uses the opportunity to make a pun on the word know, using it in an aside -- a comment only the audience can hear. Jack interprets know to mean they no longer had sex, insinuating Lady Lancing's preference for the French maid. He says, \\\"And after six months nobody knew her,\\\" indicating that the homosexual experience made a new woman of her. Although homosexuality would have been seen as immoral to Wilde's audience, Jack indicates that being homosexual might be a good thing -- almost as a social commentary -- directly to the audience. It seems a double life is necessary after one is married, whether it be bunburying or the homosexual life Wilde was experiencing in an increasingly public way. Wilde continues his assault on family life in Act III by mentioning its strange qualities in several conversations. It appears rather strange, for example, that Lady Bracknell cannot even recall the Christian name of her brother-in-law, Algy's father. Algernon's father died before Algernon was one, so stranger yet is Algernon's comment, \\\"We were never even on speaking terms.\\\" He gives that as the reason he cannot remember his father's name. Further assaulting family life, Wilde has Lady Bracknell describe Lord Moncrieff as \\\"eccentric\\\" but excuses his behavior because it \\\"was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestions, and other things of that kind.\\\" Marriage is lumped together with things such as indigestion. In explaining Lord Moncrieff's marriage, Lady Bracknell says that he was \\\"essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.\\\" Her description invites suspicion that the local constabulary might have visited because of domestic disturbances. Family life and domestic bliss do not get high marks in Wilde's estimation. When Miss Prism humorously resolves the problem of Jack's lineage, Wilde takes his hero of unknown origins and paints him as the aristocrat who will now be assimilated into his rightful place in the social structure. Through the sad melodrama of Jack's handbag parentage, Wilde exaggerates the Victorian cliche of the poor foundling who makes good. As soon as Jack is known to be a member of the established aristocracy, a Moncrieff in fact, he is seen as an appropriate person for Gwendolen to marry. They will, according to Wilde, live happily ever after in wedded bliss and continue the aristocratic blindness to anything that truly matters. The tag line of the play, spoken by Jack, is a familiar convention in Victorian farces. In discovering that he has been telling the truth all along -- his name is Ernest, and he has a brother -- Jack makes fun of the Victorian virtues of sincerity and honesty and asks Gwendolen to forgive him for \\\"speaking nothing but the truth.\\\" He now realizes the importance of being the person he is supposed to be. Wilde is saying perhaps that a new kind of earnestness exists, one that is different from the virtues extolled by the Victorians. Maybe it is possible to be honest and understand what should be taken seriously in life rather than being deceptive, hypocritical, and superficial. Some readers believe, however, that the ending shows Jack mockingly redefining Victorian earnestness as just the opposite: a life of lies, pleasure and beauty. Critics debate the interpretation of the last line. A curious stage direction occurs in Act III, revealing the concern Wilde had for the staging of his play to compliment his ideas. As his couples come together and move apart, he emphasizes the choreography of the pairs. He has them speak in unison, both the women together and the men together. It matters not who they are; they are interchangeable. Marriage is simply an institution that is a gesture, like a christening. The unison speaking is very stylistic, not meant to be realistic at all. It reveals Wilde's attitude that what is important in Victorian marriage -- names -- really should not be as important as other considerations. In the end, Wilde leaves his audience thinking about the trivial social conventions they deem important. Their Victorian virtues perhaps need redefining. Institutions such as marriage, religion, family values and money should perhaps have new interpretations. The character of people, rather than their names and family fortunes, should weigh most heavily when considering their worth. Wilde was able to use humor to skewer these attitudes and convince his audience about the importance of being earnest. Glossary effrontery unashamed boldness.

The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house,\nas any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some\nsense of shame left.\n\nCecily.  They have been eating muffins.  That looks like repentance.\n\nGwendolen.  [After a pause.]  They don't seem to notice us at all.\nCouldn't you cough?\n\nCecily.  But I haven't got a cough.\n\nGwendolen.  They're looking at us.  What effrontery!\n\nCecily.  They're approaching.  That's very forward of them.\n\nGwendolen.  Let us preserve a dignified silence.\n\nCecily.  Certainly.  It's the only thing to do now.  [Enter Jack followed\nby Algernon.  They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British\nOpera.]\n\nGwendolen.  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.\n\nCecily.  A most distasteful one.\n\nGwendolen.  But we will not be the first to speak.\n\nCecily.  Certainly not.\n\nGwendolen.  Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.\nMuch depends on your reply.\n\nCecily.  Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.  Mr. Moncrieff,\nkindly answer me the following question.  Why did you pretend to be my\nguardian's brother?\n\nAlgernon.  In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.\n\nCecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  That certainly seems a satisfactory\nexplanation, does it not?\n\nGwendolen.  Yes, dear, if you can believe him.\n\nCecily.  I don't.  But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his\nanswer.\n\nGwendolen.  True.  In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity\nis the vital thing.  Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me\nfor pretending to have a brother?  Was it in order that you might have an\nopportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?\n\nJack.  Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?\n\nGwendolen.  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.  But I intend to\ncrush them.  This is not the moment for German scepticism.  [Moving to\nCecily.]  Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially\nMr. Worthing's.  That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.\n\nCecily.  I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.  His voice\nalone inspires one with absolute credulity.\n\nGwendolen.  Then you think we should forgive them?\n\nCecily.  Yes.  I mean no.\n\nGwendolen.  True!  I had forgotten.  There are principles at stake that\none cannot surrender.  Which of us should tell them?  The task is not a\npleasant one.\n\nCecily.  Could we not both speak at the same time?\n\nGwendolen.  An excellent idea!  I nearly always speak at the same time as\nother people.  Will you take the time from me?\n\nCecily.  Certainly.  [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]\n\nGwendolen and Cecily [Speaking together.]  Your Christian names are still\nan insuperable barrier.  That is all!\n\nJack and Algernon [Speaking together.]  Our Christian names!  Is that\nall?  But we are going to be christened this afternoon.\n\nGwendolen.  [To Jack.]  For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible\nthing?\n\nJack.  I am.\n\nCecily.  [To Algernon.]  To please me you are ready to face this fearful\nordeal?\n\nAlgernon.  I am!\n\nGwendolen.  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  Where\nquestions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.\n\nJack.  We are.  [Clasps hands with Algernon.]\n\nCecily.  They have moments of physical courage of which we women know\nabsolutely nothing.\n\nGwendolen.  [To Jack.]  Darling!\n\nAlgernon.  [To Cecily.]  Darling!  [They fall into each other's arms.]\n\n[Enter Merriman.  When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the situation.]\n\nMerriman.  Ahem!  Ahem!  Lady Bracknell!\n\nJack.  Good heavens!\n\n[Enter Lady Bracknell.  The couples separate in alarm.  Exit Merriman.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Gwendolen!  What does this mean?\n\nGwendolen.  Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing,\nmamma.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Come here.  Sit down.  Sit down immediately.  Hesitation\nof any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness\nin the old.  [Turns to Jack.]  Apprised, sir, of my daughter's sudden\nflight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a\nsmall coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train.  Her unhappy\nfather is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending a\nmore than usually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on\nthe Influence of a permanent income on Thought.  I do not propose to\nundeceive him.  Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.  I\nwould consider it wrong.  But of course, you will clearly understand that\nall communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately\nfrom this moment.  On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.\n\nJack.  I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!\n\nLady Bracknell.  You are nothing of the kind, sir.  And now, as regards\nAlgernon! . . . Algernon!\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid\nfriend Mr. Bunbury resides?\n\nAlgernon.  [Stammering.]  Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunbury\nis somewhere else at present.  In fact, Bunbury is dead.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Dead!  When did Mr. Bunbury die?  His death must have\nbeen extremely sudden.\n\nAlgernon.  [Airily.]  Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poor\nBunbury died this afternoon.\n\nLady Bracknell.  What did he die of?\n\nAlgernon.  Bunbury?  Oh, he was quite exploded.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Exploded!  Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?\nI was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.  If\nso, he is well punished for his morbidity.\n\nAlgernon.  My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!  The doctors\nfound out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean--so Bunbury\ndied.\n\nLady Bracknell.  He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of\nhis physicians.  I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last\nto some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.\nAnd now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.\nWorthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now\nholding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?\n\nJack.  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.  [Lady Bracknell bows\ncoldly to Cecily.]\n\nAlgernon.  I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  I beg your pardon?\n\nCecily.  Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.]\nI do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of\nthis particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that\ngo on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics\nhave laid down for our guidance.  I think some preliminary inquiry on my\npart would not be out of place.  Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all\nconnected with any of the larger railway stations in London?  I merely\ndesire information.  Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any\nfamilies or persons whose origin was a Terminus.  [Jack looks perfectly\nfurious, but restrains himself.]\n\nJack.  [In a clear, cold voice.]  Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of\nthe late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park,\nDorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That sounds not unsatisfactory.  Three addresses always\ninspire confidence, even in tradesmen.  But what proof have I of their\nauthenticity?\n\nJack.  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.  They\nare open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Grimly.]  I have known strange errors in that\npublication.\n\nJack.  Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and\nMarkby.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Markby, Markby, and Markby?  A firm of the very highest\nposition in their profession.  Indeed I am told that one of the Mr.\nMarkby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.  So far I am\nsatisfied.\n\nJack.  [Very irritably.]  How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!  I\nhave also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of\nMiss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination,\nconfirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps\nsomewhat too exciting for a young girl.  I am not myself in favour of\npremature experiences.  [Rises, looks at her watch.]  Gwendolen! the time\napproaches for our departure.  We have not a moment to lose.  As a matter\nof form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little\nfortune?\n\nJack.  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.  That\nis all.  Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.  So pleased to have seen you.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A\nhundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems\nto me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.  Few girls of\nthe present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities\nthat last, and improve with time.  We live, I regret to say, in an age of\nsurfaces.  [To Cecily.]  Come over here, dear.  [Cecily goes across.]\nPretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as\nNature might have left it.  But we can soon alter all that.  A thoroughly\nexperienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very\nbrief space of time.  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,\nand after three months her own husband did not know her.\n\nJack.  And after six months nobody knew her.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Glares at Jack for a few moments.  Then bends, with a\npractised smile, to Cecily.]  Kindly turn round, sweet child.  [Cecily\nturns completely round.]  No, the side view is what I want.  [Cecily\npresents her profile.]  Yes, quite as I expected.  There are distinct\nsocial possibilities in your profile.  The two weak points in our age are\nits want of principle and its want of profile.  The chin a little higher,\ndear.  Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.  They are worn\nvery high, just at present.  Algernon!\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta!\n\nLady Bracknell.  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's\nprofile.\n\nAlgernon.  Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole\nworld.  And I don't care twopence about social possibilities.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only\npeople who can't get into it do that.  [To Cecily.]  Dear child, of\ncourse you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.\nBut I do not approve of mercenary marriages.  When I married Lord\nBracknell I had no fortune of any kind.  But I never dreamed for a moment\nof allowing that to stand in my way.  Well, I suppose I must give my\nconsent.\n\nAlgernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Cecily, you may kiss me!\n\nCecily.  [Kisses her.]  Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\n\nCecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\n\nAlgernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nCecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long\nengagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each\nother's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\nJack.  I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this\nengagement is quite out of the question.  I am Miss Cardew's guardian,\nand she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.  That\nconsent I absolutely decline to give.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Upon what grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely,\nI may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.  He has nothing,\nbut he looks everything.  What more can one desire?\n\nJack.  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady\nBracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at\nall of his moral character.  I suspect him of being untruthful.  [Algernon\nand Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Untruthful!  My nephew Algernon?  Impossible!  He is an\nOxonian.\n\nJack.  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This\nafternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question\nof romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false\npretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I've just\nbeen informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,\nBrut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing his\ndisgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in\nalienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to\ntea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct all\nthe more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first\nthat I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don't\nintend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so\nmyself yesterday afternoon.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have\ndecided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.\n\nJack.  That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.  My own decision,\nhowever, is unalterable.  I decline to give my consent.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [To Cecily.]  Come here, sweet child.  [Cecily goes\nover.]  How old are you, dear?\n\nCecily.  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty\nwhen I go to evening parties.\n\nLady Bracknell.  You are perfectly right in making some slight\nalteration.  Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her\nage.  It looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.]  Eighteen,\nbut admitting to twenty at evening parties.  Well, it will not be very\nlong before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  So\nI don't think your guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of any\nimportance.\n\nJack.  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it\nis only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather's\nwill Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty-\nfive is a very attractive age.  London society is full of women of the\nvery highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-\nfive for years.  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.  To my own\nknowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of\nforty, which was many years ago now.  I see no reason why our dear Cecily\nshould not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she\nis at present.  There will be a large accumulation of property.\n\nCecily.  Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\n\nAlgernon.  Of course I could, Cecily.  You know I could.\n\nCecily.  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.\nI hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rather\ncross.  I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in\nothers, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\n\nAlgernon.  Then what is to be done, Cecily?\n\nCecily.  I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.\n\nLady Bracknell.  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively\nthat she cannot wait till she is thirty-five--a remark which I am bound\nto say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature--I would beg of\nyou to reconsider your decision.\n\nJack.  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own\nhands.  The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most\ngladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Rising and drawing herself up.]  You must be quite\naware that what you propose is out of the question.\n\nJack.  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward\nto.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.\nAlgernon, of course, can choose for himself.  [Pulls out her watch.]\nCome, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six,\ntrains.  To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.\n\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nChasuble.  Everything is quite ready for the christenings.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?\n\nChasuble.  [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.]\nBoth these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\n\nLady Bracknell.  At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!\nAlgernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses.\nLord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the\nway in which you wasted your time and money.\n\nChasuble.  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings\nat all this afternoon?\n\nJack.  I don't think that, as things are now, it would be of much\npractical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\n\nChasuble.  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.\nThey savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have\ncompletely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.  However, as your\npresent mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the\nchurch at once.  Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that\nfor the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the\nvestry.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Starting.]  Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss\nPrism?\n\nChasuble.  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I am on my way to join her.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  This matter\nmay prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.  Is\nthis Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with\neducation?\n\nChasuble.  [Somewhat indignantly.]  She is the most cultivated of ladies,\nand the very picture of respectability.\n\nLady Bracknell.  It is obviously the same person.  May I ask what\nposition she holds in your household?\n\nChasuble.  [Severely.]  I am a celibate, madam.\n\nJack.  [Interposing.]  Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last\nthree years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.\n\nLady Bracknell.  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.\nLet her be sent for.\n\nChasuble.  [Looking off.]  She approaches; she is nigh.\n\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\n\nMiss Prism.  I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.  I\nhave been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.  [Catches\nsight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.  Miss\nPrism grows pale and quails.  She looks anxiously round as if desirous to\nescape.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  [In a severe, judicial voice.]  Prism!  [Miss Prism bows\nher head in shame.]  Come here, Prism!  [Miss Prism approaches in a\nhumble manner.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [General consternation.  The\nCanon starts back in horror.  Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to\nshield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public\nscandal.]  Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's\nhouse, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator\nthat contained a baby of the male sex.  You never returned.  A few weeks\nlater, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,\nthe perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a\nremote corner of Bayswater.  It contained the manuscript of a\nthree-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.  [Miss\nPrism starts in involuntary indignation.]  But the baby was not there!\n[Every one looks at Miss Prism.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [A pause.]\n\nMiss Prism.  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.  I\nonly wish I did.  The plain facts of the case are these.  On the morning\nof the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I\nprepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  I had also\nwith me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to\nplace the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my\nfew unoccupied hours.  In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I\nnever can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette,\nand placed the baby in the hand-bag.\n\nJack.  [Who has been listening attentively.]  But where did you deposit\nthe hand-bag?\n\nMiss Prism.  Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\n\nJack.  Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.  I\ninsist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that\ninfant.\n\nMiss Prism.  I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway\nstations in London.\n\nJack.  What railway station?\n\nMiss Prism.  [Quite crushed.]  Victoria.  The Brighton line.  [Sinks into\na chair.]\n\nJack.  I must retire to my room for a moment.  Gwendolen, wait here for\nme.\n\nGwendolen.  If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my\nlife.  [Exit Jack in great excitement.]\n\nChasuble.  What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\n\nLady Bracknell.  I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble.  I need hardly\ntell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not\nsupposed to occur.  They are hardly considered the thing.\n\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.  Every\none looks up.]\n\nCecily.  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\n\nChasuble.  Your guardian has a very emotional nature.\n\nLady Bracknell.  This noise is extremely unpleasant.  It sounds as if he\nwas having an argument.  I dislike arguments of any kind.  They are\nalways vulgar, and often convincing.\n\nChasuble.  [Looking up.]  It has stopped now.  [The noise is redoubled.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\n\nGwendolen.  This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.  [Enter Jack\nwith a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\n\nJack.  [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]  Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?\nExamine it carefully before you speak.  The happiness of more than one\nlife depends on your answer.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Calmly.]  It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it\nreceived through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and\nhappier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of\na temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  And\nhere, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in an\nextravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedly\nmine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has\nbeen a great inconvenience being without it all these years.\n\nJack.  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism, more is restored to you than\nthis hand-bag.  I was the baby you placed in it.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Amazed.]  You?\n\nJack.  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother!\n\nMiss Prism.  [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I am\nunmarried!\n\nJack.  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.  But after all,\nwho has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?  Cannot\nrepentance wipe out an act of folly?  Why should there be one law for\nmen, and another for women?  Mother, I forgive you.  [Tries to embrace\nher again.]\n\nMiss Prism.  [Still more indignant.]  Mr. Worthing, there is some error.\n[Pointing to Lady Bracknell.]  There is the lady who can tell you who you\nreally are.\n\nJack.  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but\nwould you kindly inform me who I am?\n\nLady Bracknell.  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not\naltogether please you.  You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs.\nMoncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother.\n\nJack.  Algy's elder brother!  Then I have a brother after all.  I knew I\nhad a brother!  I always said I had a brother!  Cecily,--how could you\nhave ever doubted that I had a brother?  [Seizes hold of Algernon.]  Dr.\nChasuble, my unfortunate brother.  Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.\nGwendolen, my unfortunate brother.  Algy, you young scoundrel, you will\nhave to treat me with more respect in the future.  You have never behaved\nto me like a brother in all your life.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.  I did my best,\nhowever, though I was out of practice.\n\n[Shakes hands.]\n\nGwendolen.  [To Jack.]  My own!  But what own are you?  What is your\nChristian name, now that you have become some one else?\n\nJack.  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point.  Your\ndecision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\n\nGwendolen.  I never change, except in my affections.\n\nCecily.  What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\n\nJack.  Then the question had better be cleared up at once.  Aunt Augusta,\na moment.  At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I\nbeen christened already?\n\nLady Bracknell.  Every luxury that money could buy, including\nchristening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\n\nJack.  Then I was christened!  That is settled.  Now, what name was I\ngiven?  Let me know the worst.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after\nyour father.\n\nJack.  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at the present moment recall\nwhat the General's Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one.\nHe was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was the\nresult of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other\nthings of that kind.\n\nJack.  Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?\n\nAlgernon.  My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  He died\nbefore I was a year old.\n\nJack.  His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose,\nAunt Augusta?\n\nLady Bracknell.  The General was essentially a man of peace, except in\nhis domestic life.  But I have no doubt his name would appear in any\nmilitary directory.\n\nJack.  The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.  These delightful\nrecords should have been my constant study.  [Rushes to bookcase and\ntears the books out.]  M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what\nghastly names they have--Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!  Lieutenant\n1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian\nnames, Ernest John.  [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite\ncalmly.]  I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I?\nWell, it is Ernest after all.  I mean it naturally is Ernest.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Yes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest,\nI knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.\n\nGwendolen.  Ernest!  My own Ernest!  I felt from the first that you could\nhave no other name!\n\nJack.  Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly\nthat all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  Can you\nforgive me?\n\nGwendolen.  I can.  For I feel that you are sure to change.\n\nJack.  My own one!\n\nChasuble.  [To Miss Prism.]  Laetitia!  [Embraces her]\n\nMiss Prism.  [Enthusiastically.]  Frederick!  At last!\n\nAlgernon.  Cecily!  [Embraces her.]  At last!\n\nJack.  Gwendolen!  [Embraces her.]  At last!\n\nLady Bracknell.

If they do, the ladies intend to be cold and heartless. The men do come in and start explaining why they lied about their names. The women accept their explanations but still have a problem with them lacking the name Ernest. Both men proclaim that they plan to be rechristened, and Gwendolen and Cecily forgive them, and both couples embrace. Merriman discretely coughs to signal the entrance of Lady Bracknell. She desires an explanation for these hugs, and Gwendolen tells her that she is engaged to Jack. Lady Bracknell says that they are not engaged and insists that they cease all communication. She inquires about Algernon's invalid friend, Bunbury, and Algernon explains that he killed him that afternoon; Bunbury exploded. He also adds that he and Cecily are engaged. Immediately, Lady Bracknell interrogates Jack about Cecily's expectations. However, because she has a fortune of 130,000 pounds, Lady Bracknell believes her to have \"distinct social possibilities.\" Lady Bracknell gives her consent to Algernon's engagement, but Jack immediately objects as Cecily's guardian. He says that Algernon is a liar and lists all the lies he has told. Also, Cecily does not come into her fortune and lose Jack as a guardian until she is 35 years old. Algernon says he can wait, but Cecily says she cannot. So Jack, in a moment of brilliance, declares that he will agree to the marriage if Lady Bracknell will consent to his engagement to Gwendolen. That is out of the question, and Lady Bracknell prepares to leave with Gwendolen. Dr. Chasuble arrives and announces that he is ready for the christenings. Jack replies that they are useless now, and Chasuble decides to head back to the church where Miss Prism is waiting. The name Prism shocks Lady Bracknell, and she demands to see the governess. When Miss Prism arrives, she sees Lady Bracknell and turns pale. In a moment of great coincidence, Lady Bracknell reveals that Miss Prism left Lord Bracknell's house 28 years ago. On a normal walk with the baby carriage, she disappeared, along with the baby. She demands to know where the baby is. Prism explains that in a moment of great distraction, she placed the baby in her handbag and her three-volume, manuscript in the baby carriage. The baby and handbag were accidentally left in the train station. When she discovered her error, she abandoned the baby carriage and disappeared. Jack excitedly asks her which station it was, and when she reveals that it was Victoria Station, the Brighton Line, he runs from the room and returns with a black leather bag. When Prism identifies it, he embraces her, believing her to be his mother. She protests that she is not married and says that he will have to ask Lady Bracknell for the identity of his mother. Jack discovers that he is actually the son of Lady Bracknell's sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and that Algy is his older brother. Jack is overcome to know that he really does have an unfortunate scoundrel for a brother. He asks what his christened name was, and Lady Bracknell explains that it is Ernest John. So, Jack asserts that he had been speaking the truth all along: His name is Ernest, and he does have a brother. Both couples embrace, as do Chasuble and Miss Prism, and Jack declares that he finally realizes the importance of being earnest.","summary_analysis":"Act III offers happy resolution to the problems of identity and marriage that drive much of the humor in the previous acts. Wilde continues to mock the social customs and attitudes of the aristocratic class. He relentlessly attacks their values, views on marriage and respectability, sexual attitudes, and concern for stability in the social structure. Wilde attacks social behavior with the continuation of speeches by his characters that are the opposite of their actions. While Cecily and Gwendolen agree to keep a dignified silence, Gwendolen actually states that they will not be the first ones to speak to the men. In the very next line she says, \"Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.\" Wilde seems to be saying that people speak as if they have strong opinions, but their actions do not support their words. If actions truly do speak louder than words, Wilde has made his point: Society, literally, speaks volumes, but the words are meaningless. Wilde continues his criticism of society's valuing style over substance when Gwendolen says, \"In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.\" Lady Bracknell discusses Algernon's marriage assets in the same light. She says, \"Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man. He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?\" Indeed, in a society where looks are everything and substance is discounted, Algernon is the perfect husband. What else do aristocrats value? They seem to esteem the appearance of respectability. Respectability means children are born within the context of marriage. Wilde once again mocks the hypocrisy of the aristocrats who appear to value monogamy but pretend not to notice affairs. Jack's speech to Miss Prism, whom he believes to be his mother, is humorous in both its indignant defense of marriage and also its mocking of the loudly touted religious reformer's virtues of repentance and forgiveness. He says to Miss Prism, \"Unmarried! I do not deny that is a serious blow.... Mother, I forgive you.\" His words are all the more humorous when Miss Prism indignantly denies being his mother. It was not at all unusual for aristocrats to have children born out of wedlock, but society turned its head, pretended not to know about those children, and did not condemn their fathers. The gulf between the upper class and its servants is explored in the scenes with Merriman and Prism. When Lady Bracknell unexpectedly shows up at Jack's, Merriman coughs discretely to warn the couples of her arrival. One can only imagine his humorous thoughts as he watches the wealthy tiptoe around each other and argue about what should be important. When Lady Bracknell hears the description of Prism and recognizes her as their former nanny, she calls for Miss Prism by shouting \"Prism!\" without using a title in front of her name. Imperiously, Lady Bracknell divides the servant from the lady of the manor. Wilde's audience would recognize this behavior on the part of the servants and the upper class. The stuffy class distinctions defined the society in which they lived. In an age of social registers, Lady Bracknell laments that even the Court Guides have errors. In the next breath, she discusses bribing Gwendolen's maid to find out what is happening in her daughter's life. In Act III she also reveals that her aristocratic brother's family entrusted their most precious possession -- Jack -- to a woman who is more interested in her handbag and manuscript than in what happens to the baby in her charge. Wilde seems to be questioning the values of a society that believes in social registers, hires other people to neglectfully watch its children, and uses bribery to keep track of the children who are not missing. The death of Bunbury gives Wilde the opportunity to speak of aristocratic fears and have some continued fun with the upper class's lack of compassion about death. The 1885 Trafalgar Square riots brought on ruling-class fears of insurrection, anarchism and socialism. Wilde humorously touches on these fears when he allows Algernon to explain the explosion of Bunbury. Lady Bracknell, fearing the worst, exclaims, \"Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation. If so, he is well punished for his morbidity.\" Evidently, to Lady Bracknell's acquaintances, laws that protect the welfare of those less fortunate are strictly morbid subjects. In fact, this attitude seems to contradict the upper-class concern for reform. However, in reality, Wilde is confirming the upper-class definition of social reform: conforming to the status quo. In Act III Wilde makes a comment on the value of being homosexual with a veiled reference to Lady Lancing. When Lady Bracknell asserts that Cecily needs to have a more sophisticated hairstyle, she recommends \"a thoroughly experienced French maid\" who can make a great deal of change in a very short time. She explains that such a change happened to an acquaintance of hers, Lady Lancing, and that after three months \"her own husband did not know her.\" Jack uses the opportunity to make a pun on the word know, using it in an aside -- a comment only the audience can hear. Jack interprets know to mean they no longer had sex, insinuating Lady Lancing's preference for the French maid. He says, \"And after six months nobody knew her,\" indicating that the homosexual experience made a new woman of her. Although homosexuality would have been seen as immoral to Wilde's audience, Jack indicates that being homosexual might be a good thing -- almost as a social commentary -- directly to the audience. It seems a double life is necessary after one is married, whether it be bunburying or the homosexual life Wilde was experiencing in an increasingly public way. Wilde continues his assault on family life in Act III by mentioning its strange qualities in several conversations. It appears rather strange, for example, that Lady Bracknell cannot even recall the Christian name of her brother-in-law, Algy's father. Algernon's father died before Algernon was one, so stranger yet is Algernon's comment, \"We were never even on speaking terms.\" He gives that as the reason he cannot remember his father's name. Further assaulting family life, Wilde has Lady Bracknell describe Lord Moncrieff as \"eccentric\" but excuses his behavior because it \"was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestions, and other things of that kind.\" Marriage is lumped together with things such as indigestion. In explaining Lord Moncrieff's marriage, Lady Bracknell says that he was \"essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.\" Her description invites suspicion that the local constabulary might have visited because of domestic disturbances. Family life and domestic bliss do not get high marks in Wilde's estimation. When Miss Prism humorously resolves the problem of Jack's lineage, Wilde takes his hero of unknown origins and paints him as the aristocrat who will now be assimilated into his rightful place in the social structure. Through the sad melodrama of Jack's handbag parentage, Wilde exaggerates the Victorian cliche of the poor foundling who makes good. As soon as Jack is known to be a member of the established aristocracy, a Moncrieff in fact, he is seen as an appropriate person for Gwendolen to marry. They will, according to Wilde, live happily ever after in wedded bliss and continue the aristocratic blindness to anything that truly matters. The tag line of the play, spoken by Jack, is a familiar convention in Victorian farces. In discovering that he has been telling the truth all along -- his name is Ernest, and he has a brother -- Jack makes fun of the Victorian virtues of sincerity and honesty and asks Gwendolen to forgive him for \"speaking nothing but the truth.\" He now realizes the importance of being the person he is supposed to be. Wilde is saying perhaps that a new kind of earnestness exists, one that is different from the virtues extolled by the Victorians. Maybe it is possible to be honest and understand what should be taken seriously in life rather than being deceptive, hypocritical, and superficial. Some readers believe, however, that the ending shows Jack mockingly redefining Victorian earnestness as just the opposite: a life of lies, pleasure and beauty. Critics debate the interpretation of the last line. A curious stage direction occurs in Act III, revealing the concern Wilde had for the staging of his play to compliment his ideas. As his couples come together and move apart, he emphasizes the choreography of the pairs. He has them speak in unison, both the women together and the men together. It matters not who they are; they are interchangeable. Marriage is simply an institution that is a gesture, like a christening. The unison speaking is very stylistic, not meant to be realistic at all. It reveals Wilde's attitude that what is important in Victorian marriage -- names -- really should not be as important as other considerations. In the end, Wilde leaves his audience thinking about the trivial social conventions they deem important. Their Victorian virtues perhaps need redefining. Institutions such as marriage, religion, family values and money should perhaps have new interpretations. The character of people, rather than their names and family fortunes, should weigh most heavily when considering their worth. Wilde was able to use humor to skewer these attitudes and convince his audience about the importance of being earnest. Glossary effrontery unashamed boldness.

It's July. A table full of books is set up beneath a yew tree in the rose garden. Miss Prism is sitting at the table while Cecily is in the back, watering the flowers. Miss Prism calls to Cecily to stop doing such a mundane task as watering the flowers because she needs to do her German grammar lesson. Cecily argues that she doesn't want to because she knows she looks plain after her German lesson. Miss Prism retorts that Uncle Jack is only looking out for Cecily's education. Cecily complains that Uncle Jack is so serious. Miss Prism defends him as the pinnacle of \"duty and responsibility\" . She adds that he's even helping out that unfortunately troublesome younger brother of his. This piques Cecily's interest and she wishes aloud that Uncle Jack would bring Ernest by sometime so that Miss Prism could reform him. She begins writing in her diary, where she keeps all the \"wonderful secrets of life\" . At this, Miss Prism comments that she was once a writer herself. She wrote a three-volume novel back in the day. Miss Prism tells Cecily to work on her lesson. But the perfect excuse to ignore the lesson is just arriving--Dr. Chasuble. At the sight of him, Miss Prism blushes and stands. They're so obviously crushing on each other that Cecily finds it easy to persuade them to take a walk together. While they're out, Merriman the butler tells Cecily that a Mr. Ernest Worthing has just arrived. Cecily is overjoyed to finally be able to meet the infamous Ernest, but she's scared at the same time. Algernon enters, disguised as Ernest. He greets his \"cousin,\" Cici. They talk about how \"wicked\" he is, with Cecily making comments about how he should reform himself. Charmingly, Algernon\/Ernest asks Cecily to try to reform him that very afternoon. As they're flirting and Ernest is finding every way possible to compliment Cecily, like asking for a pink rose for his button-hole \"because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily\" . Algernon learns that Jack plans to send Ernest to Australia. As Cecily's putting a flower into his buttonhole, Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return, discussing the moral advantages and disadvantages of marriage. They're so wrapped up in each other that they don't realize that Cecily is not where they left her. Before they can send out a search party, Jack arrives home, dressed in a black suit of mourning. When they ask him about it, Jack announces that he's returned early because his brother Ernest is dead. He died last night in Paris of a \"severe chill.\" When Dr. Chasuble offers to perform a funeral ceremony for Ernest, Jack suddenly remembers something. He asks Dr. Chasuble if he can be christened. After some questions, Dr. Chasuble relents and they arrange for Jack to come by at half-past five that evening. Cecily comes from the house to meet her Uncle Jack with the happy news that his brother Ernest arrived just recently and is now in the dining-room. Jack is completely confused. Dr. Chasuble--trying to smooth over the awkward situation--says that these are good tidings indeed . The mystery is solved when Jack sees Algernon sitting at the table. Jack refuses to shake hands with Algernon. We learn from Cecily that Ernest has been telling her about his poor friend, Mr. Bunbury. Finally, Cecily declares she will never speak to Uncle Jack again if he doesn't shake hands with Ernest. Jack gives in reluctantly and Miss Prism praises Cecily for her wonderful act of kindness today. They leave Jack and Ernest together. Furiously, Jack tells Algy to leave at once. But he's interrupted when Merriman comes in to reveal that Mr. Ernest's luggage has been put in the bedroom next to Jack's. Jack tells Merriman that unfortunately Ernest's dog-cart has arrived to take him away; he's been called back to town. While Jack rants at Algernon, Algernon talks about how pretty Cecily is. Jack declares the dog-cart is here and leaves, just in time to miss Algy's comment that he has fallen in love with Cecily. Cecily appears with a watering can in her hand. She and Ernest\/Algernon exchange glances. She pleads with Merriman to let Ernest stay for another five minutes. Algernon informs her that Jack is sending him away and compliments her beauty. Flattered, Cecily begins copying his words down in her diary, but refuses to let him look at it. When the dog-cart comes again, Ernest tells it to come again next week. Without ceremony, he asks Cecily to marry him. She responds amusedly that they've been engaged for months. She confides her past fantasies to him, as they're written in her diary. Apparently, Ernest proposed on Valentine's day but they'd broken it off a month later. Now they're back together, which she can prove with the many love letters from him that she has saved . Ernest kisses her for being so forgiving. Then she confides that it's always been a \"girlish dream of mine to love someone whose name was Ernest\" . Distraught, he asks her if she could love him under any other name... say... Algernon, for instance. Cecily finds it a rather aristocratic name, but no, she wouldn't be able to love him then. At that declaration, Ernest\/Algernon promptly begins asking her about the rector and whether or not he performs christenings. Algernon leaves to find Dr. Chasuble about a very important matter. As he leaves, Cecily comments that she likes his hair so much. Soon, Merriman enters to tell Cecily that a Miss Fairfax has arrived to see Mr. Worthing. Cecily invites Miss Fairfax to sit with her until Uncle Jack comes out. They're both such charming girls that when they meet, they declare they'll be best friends and call each other immediately by their first names. They talk for a little while before Gwendolen works up the balls to ask Cecily if she can inspect her. Gwendolen, peering through her glasses, finds Cecily rather too attractive and loudly wishes that she were a bit older and more decidedly more dowdy. She asks about Cici's relations and finds out that Mr. Worthing is Cecily's guardian. Now that's problematic, Gwendolen says, since Ernest never mentioned it to her. When Cecily hears the name Ernest, she quickly explains the situation. It's not Ernest Worthing who is my guardian, she says sweetly, but his older brother, Jack. That's a relief to Gwendolen, who suddenly becomes polite again. Cecily proudly declares that she's going to be Ernest Worthing's wife. Gwendolen rises to her feet. Excuse me? You're mistaken. Ernest proposed to me yesterday. Cecily retorts that he must've changed his mind because he just proposed to her ten minutes ago. The two women eye each other coldly before Gwendolen announces--alluding to Cecily's rude manners--that they obviously move in different social circles. Right before they can start clawing at each other, Merriman comes by to arrange their tea things. The girls bite back their acidic words in his presence. As Merriman serves them, they glare at each other but chitchat in cordial tones. However, their small talk bristles with little insults, mostly about the superiority of urban life vs. the superiority of country life . When Cecily serves Gwendolen tea, she serves it in the opposite manner that Gwendolen requests--giving her lots of sugar in her tea and cake instead of bread and butter. Thank goodness, Jack arrives just in time to break up their fight. When Gwendolen jumps on him and asks if he's to be married to Cecily, Jack laughs it off and kisses Gwendolen. The truth comes out. Cecily replies that he's not Ernest Worthing; that's Uncle Jack. At the unglamorous name, Gwendolen recoils in disgust. Right on cue, Algernon enters and Cecily goes through the same routine with him. When he confirms he's not to be married to Gwendolen, she allows him to kiss her. This time it's Gwendolen's turn to clear up the confusion. She reveals that he's not Ernest Worthing; it's Algernon Moncrieff, her cousin. Cecily backs away when she hears \"Algernon.\" The two women embrace each other in distress, while the men hang their heads in shame. They finally ask Jack who Ernest is and he is forced to admit that Ernest doesn't exist. When both girls realize with horror that neither of them are engaged to Ernest, they agree to go into the house where the men won't dare to follow them. With scornful looks, they leave. Infuriated and frustrated, the two men turn on each other for the horrible results of their Bunburying. Both blame each other for deceiving the girls. They argue for a while and Algernon sits down agitatedly and begins to eat the muffins left by the ladies. Jack comments that it's heartless for him to eat so calmly when they're in such a state and begins fighting with him over the muffins. In the midst of their squabbling, each discovers that the other has a christening to attend that evening to be named Ernest. Their christenings are scheduled only fifteen minutes apart! Both try to dissuade each other from doing so, without success. The act ends with both guys still munching muffins and bickering with each other."],"next summary id":"act iii","next chapter":"No time has elapsed, but in Act III Gwendolen and Cecily are in the morning room of the Manor House, looking out the window at Jack and Algernon and hoping they will come in.

Jack excitedly asks her which station it was, and when she reveals that it was Victoria Station, the Brighton Line, he runs from the room and returns with a black leather bag. When Prism identifies it, he embraces her, believing her to be his mother. She protests that she is not married and says that he will have to ask Lady Bracknell for the identity of his mother. Jack discovers that he is actually the son of Lady Bracknell's sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and that Algy is his older brother. Jack is overcome to know that he really does have an unfortunate scoundrel for a brother. He asks what his christened name was, and Lady Bracknell explains that it is Ernest John. So, Jack asserts that he had been speaking the truth all along: His name is Ernest, and he does have a brother. Both couples embrace, as do Chasuble and Miss Prism, and Jack declares that he finally realizes the importance of being earnest."}

Not improbably, the\nreader might be willing to spare me the trouble; for I have made but a\npoor and dim figure in my own narrative, establishing no separate\ninterest, and suffering my colorless life to take its hue from other\nlives.  But one still retains some little consideration for one's self;\nso I keep these last two or three pages for my individual and sole\nbehoof.\n\nBut what, after all, have I to tell?  Nothing, nothing, nothing!  I\nleft Blithedale within the week after Zenobia's death, and went back\nthither no more.  The whole soil of our farm, for a long time\nafterwards, seemed but the sodded earth over her grave.  I could not\ntoil there, nor live upon its products.  Often, however, in these years\nthat are darkening around me, I remember our beautiful scheme of a\nnoble and unselfish life; and how fair, in that first summer, appeared\nthe prospect that it might endure for generations, and be perfected, as\nthe ages rolled away, into the system of a people and a world!  Were my\nformer associates now there,--were there only three or four of those\ntrue-hearted men still laboring in the sun,--I sometimes fancy that I\nshould direct my world-weary footsteps thitherward, and entreat them to\nreceive me, for old friendship's sake.  More and more I feel that we\nhad struck upon what ought to be a truth.  Posterity may dig it up, and\nprofit by it.  The experiment, so far as its original projectors were\nconcerned, proved, long ago, a failure; first lapsing into Fourierism,\nand dying, as it well deserved, for this infidelity to its own higher\nspirit.  Where once we toiled with our whole hopeful hearts, the town\npaupers, aged, nerveless, and disconsolate, creep sluggishly afield.\nAlas, what faith is requisite to bear up against such results of\ngenerous effort!\n\nMy subsequent life has passed,--I was going to say happily, but, at all\nevents, tolerably enough.  I am now at middle age, well, well, a step\nor two beyond the midmost point, and I care not a fig who knows it!--a\nbachelor, with no very decided purpose of ever being otherwise. I have\nbeen twice to Europe, and spent a year or two rather agreeably at each\nvisit.  Being well to do in the world, and having nobody but myself to\ncare for, I live very much at my ease, and fare sumptuously every day.\nAs for poetry, I have given it up, notwithstanding that Dr.\nGriswold--as the reader, of course, knows--has placed me at a fair\nelevation among our minor minstrelsy, on the strength of my pretty\nlittle volume, published ten years ago. As regards human progress (in\nspite of my irrepressible yearnings over the Blithedale reminiscences),\nlet them believe in it who can, and aid in it who choose.  If I could\nearnestly do either, it might be all the better for my comfort.  As\nHollingsworth once told me, I lack a purpose.  How strange!  He was\nruined, morally, by an overplus of the very same ingredient, the want\nof which, I occasionally suspect, has rendered my own life all an\nemptiness.  I by no means wish to die.  Yet, were there any cause, in\nthis whole chaos of human struggle, worth a sane man's dying for, and\nwhich my death would benefit, then--provided, however, the effort did\nnot involve an unreasonable amount of trouble--methinks I might be bold\nto offer up my life.  If Kossuth, for example, would pitch the\nbattlefield of Hungarian rights within an easy ride of my abode, and\nchoose a mild, sunny morning, after breakfast, for the conflict, Miles\nCoverdale would gladly be his man, for one brave rush upon the levelled\nbayonets.  Further than that, I should be loath to pledge myself.\n\nI exaggerate my own defects.  The reader must not take my own word for\nit, nor believe me altogether changed from the young man who once hoped\nstrenuously, and struggled not so much amiss.  Frostier heads than mine\nhave gained honor in the world; frostier hearts have imbibed new\nwarmth, and been newly happy.  Life, however, it must be owned, has\ncome to rather an idle pass with me.  Would my friends like to know\nwhat brought it thither?  There is one secret,--I have concealed it all\nalong, and never meant to let the least whisper of it escape,--one\nfoolish little secret, which possibly may have had something to do with\nthese inactive years of meridian manhood, with my bachelorship, with\nthe unsatisfied retrospect that I fling back on life, and my listless\nglance towards the future.  Shall I reveal it? It is an absurd thing\nfor a man in his afternoon,--a man of the world, moreover, with these\nthree white hairs in his brown mustache and that deepening track of a\ncrow's-foot on each temple,--an absurd thing ever to have happened, and\nquite the absurdest for an old bachelor, like me, to talk about.  But\nit rises to my throat; so let it come.\n\nI perceive, moreover, that the confession, brief as it shall be, will\nthrow a gleam of light over my behavior throughout the foregoing\nincidents, and is, indeed, essential to the full understanding of my\nstory.  The reader, therefore, since I have disclosed so much, is\nentitled to this one word more.  As I write it, he will charitably\nsuppose me to blush, and turn away my face:\n\nI--I myself--was in love--with--Priscilla!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":867.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 29","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180420214134\/http:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-blithedale-romance\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-25-29","summary_text":"Coverdale says he will say a few things about himself, though his narrative has mostly been focused on others.

On November 5, 1904, as he approaches New York City, returning from yet another trip to Europe, Henry is excited by the vitality of the great city, which \\\"became frantic in its effort to explain something that defied meaning. Power seemed to have outgrown its servitude and to have asserted its freedom.\\\" This is the age that he has anticipated in the last third of the Education, but he leaves the work of the future to the next generation. Adams feels that he and his contemporaries are near the end. Clarence King died -- broken -- in 1901; John Hay is in poor shape and, despite Henry's efforts, dies on July 1, 1905. Three days later, Henry writes to Mrs. Hay to express condolences and reflect on the twilight of his own life: \\\"I had not the heart to telegraph. All the world will have done that, and will have overwhelmed you with messages of condolence. I can say nothing. You will understand it. . . . As for me, it is time to bid good-bye. I am tired. My last hold on the world is lost with him.\\\" Adams has privately printed the Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres in 1904; the first private edition of the Education will come out in 1907. He will write a little more in the next few years, but he suffers a disabling stroke in 1912 and dies on March 27, 1918. However, the story of the education of the boy from Boston stops in 1905. Henry wonders, at the end, whether he and his old friends may be allowed to return just for one day -- in 1938, say, their centenary -- to see the \\\"mistakes of their own lives made clear in the light of the mistakes of their successors.\\\" He wistfully wonders if it will be, for the first time in history, a world that \\\"sensitive and timid natures could regard without a shudder.\\\" For once, Henry's speculation seems wrong. With Hitler leading the Third Reich into World War II, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki soon to come, 1938 will be no time for timid natures. But having completed this journey with him, the reader knows that Henry already suspects something like that.

As he came up the bay again, November 5, 1904, an older man\nthan either his father or Motley in 1868, he found the approach more\nstriking than ever--wonderful--unlike anything man had ever seen--and\nlike nothing he had ever much cared to see. The outline of the city\nbecame frantic in its effort to explain something that defied meaning.\nPower seemed to have outgrown its servitude and to have asserted its\nfreedom. The cylinder had exploded, and thrown great masses of stone\nand steam against the sky. The city had the air and movement of\nhysteria, and the citizens were crying, in every accent of anger and\nalarm, that the new forces must at any cost be brought under control.\nProsperity never before imagined, power never yet wielded by man, speed\nnever reached by anything but a meteor, had made the world irritable,\nnervous, querulous, unreasonable and afraid. All New York was demanding\nnew men, and all the new forces, condensed into corporations, were\ndemanding a new type of man--a man with ten times the endurance,\nenergy, will and mind of the old type--for whom they were ready to pay\nmillions at sight. As one jolted over the pavements or read the last\nweek's newspapers, the new man seemed close at hand, for the old one\nhad plainly reached the end of his strength, and his failure had become\ncatastrophic. Every one saw it, and every municipal election shrieked\nchaos. A traveller in the highways of history looked out of the club\nwindow on the turmoil of Fifth Avenue, and felt himself in Rome, under\nDiocletian, witnessing the anarchy, conscious of the compulsion, eager\nfor the solution, but unable to conceive whence the next impulse was to\ncome or how it was to act. The two-thousand-years failure of\nChristianity roared upward from Broadway, and no Constantine the Great\nwas in sight.\n\n  Having nothing else to do, the traveller went on to Washington\nto wait the end. There Roosevelt was training Constantines and battling\nTrusts. With the Battle of Trusts, a student of mechanics felt entire\nsympathy, not merely as a matter of politics or society, but also as a\nmeasure of motion. The Trusts and Corporations stood for the larger\npart of the new power that had been created since 1840, and were\nobnoxious because of their vigorous and unscrupulous energy. They were\nrevolutionary, troubling all the old conventions and values, as the\nscrews of ocean steamers must trouble a school of herring. They tore\nsociety to pieces and trampled it under foot. As one of their earliest\nvictims, a citizen of Quincy, born in 1838, had learned submission and\nsilence, for he knew that, under the laws of mechanics, any change,\nwithin the range of the forces, must make his situation only worse; but\nhe was beyond measure curious to see whether the conflict of forces\nwould produce the new man, since no other energies seemed left on earth\nto breed. The new man could be only a child born of contact between the\nnew and the old energies.\n\n  Both had been familiar since childhood, as the story has shown,\nand neither had warped the umpire's judgment by its favors. If ever\njudge had reason to be impartial, it was he. The sole object of his\ninterest and sympathy was the new man, and the longer one watched, the\nless could be seen of him. Of the forces behind the Trusts, one could\nsee something; they owned a complete organization, with schools,\ntraining, wealth and purpose; but of the forces behind Roosevelt one\nknew little; their cohesion was slight; their training irregular; their\nobjects vague. The public had no idea what practical system it could\naim at, or what sort of men could manage it. The single problem before\nit was not so much to control the Trusts as to create the society that\ncould manage the Trusts. The new American must be either the child of\nthe new forces or a chance sport of nature. The attraction of\nmechanical power had already wrenched the American mind into a\ncrab-like process which Roosevelt was making heroic efforts to restore\nto even action, and he had every right to active support and sympathy\nfrom all the world, especially from the Trusts themselves so far as\nthey were human; but the doubt persisted whether the force that\neducated was really man or nature--mind or motion. The mechanical\ntheory, mostly accepted by science, seemed to require that the law of\nmass should rule. In that case, progress would continue as before.\n\n  In that, or any other case, a nineteenth-century education was\nas useless or misleading as an eighteenth-century education had been to\nthe child of 1838; but Adams had a better reason for holding his\ntongue. For his dynamic theory of history he cared no more than for the\nkinetic theory of gas; but, if it were an approach to measurement of\nmotion, it would verify or disprove itself within thirty years. At the\ncalculated acceleration, the head of the meteor-stream must very soon\npass perihelion. Therefore, dispute was idle, discussion was futile,\nand silence, next to good-temper, was the mark of sense. If the\nacceleration, measured by the development and economy of forces, were\nto continue at its rate since 1800, the mathematician of 1950 should be\nable to plot the past and future orbit of the human race as accurately\nas that of the November meteoroids.\n\n  Naturally such an attitude annoyed the players in the game, as\nthe attitude of the umpire is apt to infuriate the spectators. Above\nall, it was profoundly unmoral, and tended to discourage effort. On the\nother hand, it tended to encourage foresight and to economize waste of\nmind. If it was not itself education, it pointed out the economies\nnecessary for the education of the new American. There, the duty\nstopped.\n\n  There, too, life stopped. Nature has educated herself to a\nsingular sympathy for death. On the antarctic glacier, nearly five\nthousand feet above sea-level, Captain Scott found carcasses of seals,\nwhere the animals had laboriously flopped up, to die in peace. \"Unless\nwe had actually found these remains, it would have been past believing\nthat a dying seal could have transported itself over fifty miles of\nrough, steep, glacier-surface,\" but \"the seal seems often to crawl to\nthe shore or the ice to die, probably from its instinctive dread of its\nmarine enemies.\" In India, Purun Dass, at the end of statesmanship,\nsought solitude, and died in sanctity among the deer and monkeys,\nrather than remain with man. Even in America, the Indian Summer of life\nshould be a little sunny and a little sad, like the season, and\ninfinite in wealth and depth of tone--but never hustled. For that\nreason, one's own passive obscurity seemed sometimes nearer nature than\nJohn Hay's exposure. To the normal animal the instinct of sport is\ninnate, and historians themselves were not exempt from the passion of\nbaiting their bears; but in its turn even the seal dislikes to be\nworried to death in age by creatures that have not the strength or the\nteeth to kill him outright.\n\n  On reaching Washington, November 14, 1904, Adams saw at a\nglance that Hay must have rest. Already Mrs. Hay had bade him prepare\nto help in taking her husband to Europe as soon as the Session should\nbe over, and although Hay protested that the idea could not even be\ndiscussed, his strength failed so rapidly that he could not effectually\ndiscuss it, and ended by yielding without struggle. He would equally\nhave resigned office and retired, like Purun Dass, had not the\nPresident and the press protested; but he often debated the subject,\nand his friends could throw no light on it. Adams himself, who had set\nhis heart on seeing Hay close his career by making peace in the East,\ncould only urge that vanity for vanity, the crown of peacemaker was\nworth the cross of martyrdom; but the cross was full in sight, while\nthe crown was still uncertain. Adams found his formula for Russian\ninertia exasperatingly correct. He thought that Russia should have\nnegotiated instantly on the fall of Port Arthur, January 1, 1905; he\nfound that she had not the energy, but meant to wait till her navy\nshould be destroyed. The delay measured precisely the time that Hay had\nto spare.\n\n  The close of the Session on March 4 left him barely the\nstrength to crawl on board ship, March 18, and before his steamer had\nreached half her course, he had revived, almost as gay as when he first\nlighted on the Markoe house in I Street forty-four years earlier. The\nclouds that gather round the setting sun do not always take a sober\ncoloring from eyes that have kept watch on mortality; or, at least, the\nsobriety is sometimes scarcely sad. One walks with one's friends\nsquarely up to the portal of life, and bids good-bye with a smile. One\nhas done it so often! Hay could scarcely pace the deck; he nourished no\nillusions; he was convinced that he should never return to his work,\nand he talked lightly of the death sentence that he might any day\nexpect, but he threw off the coloring of office and mortality together,\nand the malaria of power left its only trace in the sense of tasks\nincomplete.\n\n  One could honestly help him there. Laughing frankly at his\ndozen treaties hung up in the Senate Committee-room like lambs in a\nbutcher's shop, one could still remind him of what was solidly\ncompleted. In his eight years of office he had solved nearly every old\nproblem of American statesmanship, and had left little or nothing to\nannoy his successor. He had brought the great Atlantic powers into a\nworking system, and even Russia seemed about to be dragged into a\ncombine of intelligent equilibrium based on an intelligent allotment of\nactivities. For the first time in fifteen hundred years a true Roman\npax was in sight, and would, if it succeeded, owe its virtues to him.\nExcept for making peace in Manchuria, he could do no more; and if the\nworst should happen, setting continent against continent in arms--the\nonly apparent alternative to his scheme--he need not repine at missing\nthe catastrophe.\n\n  This rosy view served to soothe disgusts which every parting\nstatesman feels, and commonly with reason. One had no need to get out\none's notebook in order to jot down the exact figures on either side.\nWhy add up the elements of resistance and anarchy? The Kaiser supplied\nhim with these figures, just as the Cretic approached Morocco. Every\none was doing it, and seemed in a panic about it. The chaos waited only\nfor his landing.\n\n  Arrived at Genoa, the party hid itself for a fortnight at\nNervi, and he gained strength rapidly as long as he made no effort and\nheard no call for action. Then they all went on to Nanheim without\nrelapse. There, after a few days, Adams left him for the regular\ntreatment, and came up to Paris. The medical reports promised well, and\nHay's letters were as humorous and light-handed as ever. To the last he\nwrote cheerfully of his progress, and amusingly with his usual light\nscepticism, of his various doctors; but when the treatment ended, three\nweeks later, and he came on to Paris, he showed, at the first glance,\nthat he had lost strength, and the return to affairs and interviews\nwore him rapidly out. He was conscious of it, and in his last talk\nbefore starting for London and Liverpool he took the end of his\nactivity for granted. \"You must hold out for the peace negotiations,\"\nwas the remonstrance. \"I've not time!\" he replied. \"You'll need little\ntime!\" was the rejoinder. Each was correct.\n\n  There it ended! Shakespeare himself could use no more than the\ncommonplace to express what is incapable of expression. \"The rest is\nsilence!\" The few familiar words, among the simplest in the language,\nconveying an idea trite beyond rivalry, served Shakespeare, and, as\nyet, no one has said more. A few weeks afterwards, one warm evening in\nearly July, as Adams was strolling down to dine under the trees at\nArmenonville, he learned that Hay was dead. He expected it; on Hay's\naccount, he was even satisfied to have his friend die, as we would all\ndie if we could, in full fame, at home and abroad, universally\nregretted, and wielding his power to the last. One had seen scores of\nemperors and heroes fade into cheap obscurity even when alive; and now,\nat least, one had not that to fear for one's friend. It was not even\nthe suddenness of the shock, or the sense of void, that threw Adams\ninto the depths of Hamlet's Shakespearean silence in the full flare of\nParis frivolity in its favorite haunt where worldly vanity reached its\nmost futile climax in human history; it was only the quiet summons to\nfollow--the assent to dismissal. It was time to go. The three friends\nhad begun life together; and the last of the three had no motive--no\nattraction--to carry it on after the others had gone. Education had\nended for all three, and only beyond some remoter horizon could its\nvalues be fixed or renewed. Perhaps some day--say 1938, their\ncentenary--they might be allowed to return together for a holiday, to\nsee the mistakes of their own lives made clear in the light of the\nmistakes of their successors; and perhaps then, for the first time\nsince man began his education among the carnivores, they would find a\nworld that sensitive and timid natures could regard without a shudder.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2148.0,"summary_name":"Chapter XXXV","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201219140608\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/e\/the-education-of-henry-adams\/summary-and-analysis\/chapter-xxxv","summary_text":"In this short, concluding chapter, Adams briefly mentions scientific power and politics, but despite the forward-looking chapter title, Nunc Age , his focus really is on the past and on endings.

Their women, when they\ngrow up, are married out, but all the males, both children and\ngrand-children, live still in the same house, in great obedience to their\ncommon parent, unless age has weakened his understanding, and in that\ncase he that is next to him in age comes in his room; but lest any city\nshould become either too great, or by any accident be dispeopled,\nprovision is made that none of their cities may contain above six\nthousand families, besides those of the country around it.  No family may\nhave less than ten and more than sixteen persons in it, but there can be\nno determined number for the children under age; this rule is easily\nobserved by removing some of the children of a more fruitful couple to\nany other family that does not abound so much in them.  By the same rule\nthey supply cities that do not increase so fast from others that breed\nfaster; and if there is any increase over the whole island, then they\ndraw out a number of their citizens out of the several towns and send\nthem over to the neighbouring continent, where, if they find that the\ninhabitants have more soil than they can well cultivate, they fix a\ncolony, taking the inhabitants into their society if they are willing to\nlive with them; and where they do that of their own accord, they quickly\nenter into their method of life and conform to their rules, and this\nproves a happiness to both nations; for, according to their constitution,\nsuch care is taken of the soil that it becomes fruitful enough for both,\nthough it might be otherwise too narrow and barren for any one of them.\nBut if the natives refuse to conform themselves to their laws they drive\nthem out of those bounds which they mark out for themselves, and use\nforce if they resist, for they account it a very just cause of war for a\nnation to hinder others from possessing a part of that soil of which they\nmake no use, but which is suffered to lie idle and uncultivated, since\nevery man has, by the law of nature, a right to such a waste portion of\nthe earth as is necessary for his subsistence.  If an accident has so\nlessened the number of the inhabitants of any of their towns that it\ncannot be made up from the other towns of the island without diminishing\nthem too much (which is said to have fallen out but twice since they were\nfirst a people, when great numbers were carried off by the plague), the\nloss is then supplied by recalling as many as are wanted from their\ncolonies, for they will abandon these rather than suffer the towns in the\nisland to sink too low.\n\n\"But to return to their manner of living in society: the oldest man of\nevery family, as has been already said, is its governor; wives serve\ntheir husbands, and children their parents, and always the younger serves\nthe elder.  Every city is divided into four equal parts, and in the\nmiddle of each there is a market-place.  What is brought thither, and\nmanufactured by the several families, is carried from thence to houses\nappointed for that purpose, in which all things of a sort are laid by\nthemselves; and thither every father goes, and takes whatsoever he or his\nfamily stand in need of, without either paying for it or leaving anything\nin exchange.  There is no reason for giving a denial to any person, since\nthere is such plenty of everything among them; and there is no danger of\na man's asking for more than he needs; they have no inducements to do\nthis, since they are sure they shall always be supplied: it is the fear\nof want that makes any of the whole race of animals either greedy or\nravenous; but, besides fear, there is in man a pride that makes him fancy\nit a particular glory to excel others in pomp and excess; but by the laws\nof the Utopians, there is no room for this.  Near these markets there are\nothers for all sorts of provisions, where there are not only herbs,\nfruits, and bread, but also fish, fowl, and cattle.  There are also,\nwithout their towns, places appointed near some running water for killing\ntheir beasts and for washing away their filth, which is done by their\nslaves; for they suffer none of their citizens to kill their cattle,\nbecause they think that pity and good-nature, which are among the best of\nthose affections that are born with us, are much impaired by the\nbutchering of animals; nor do they suffer anything that is foul or\nunclean to be brought within their towns, lest the air should be infected\nby ill-smells, which might prejudice their health.  In every street there\nare great halls, that lie at an equal distance from each other,\ndistinguished by particular names.  The Syphogrants dwell in those that\nare set over thirty families, fifteen lying on one side of it, and as\nmany on the other.  In these halls they all meet and have their repasts;\nthe stewards of every one of them come to the market-place at an\nappointed hour, and according to the number of those that belong to the\nhall they carry home provisions.  But they take more care of their sick\nthan of any others; these are lodged and provided for in public\nhospitals.  They have belonging to every town four hospitals, that are\nbuilt without their walls, and are so large that they may pass for little\ntowns; by this means, if they had ever such a number of sick persons,\nthey could lodge them conveniently, and at such a distance that such of\nthem as are sick of infectious diseases may be kept so far from the rest\nthat there can be no danger of contagion.  The hospitals are furnished\nand stored with all things that are convenient for the ease and recovery\nof the sick; and those that are put in them are looked after with such\ntender and watchful care, and are so constantly attended by their skilful\nphysicians, that as none is sent to them against their will, so there is\nscarce one in a whole town that, if he should fall ill, would not choose\nrather to go thither than lie sick at home.\n\n\"After the steward of the hospitals has taken for the sick whatsoever the\nphysician prescribes, then the best things that are left in the market\nare distributed equally among the halls in proportion to their numbers;\nonly, in the first place, they serve the Prince, the Chief Priest, the\nTranibors, the Ambassadors, and strangers, if there are any, which,\nindeed, falls out but seldom, and for whom there are houses, well\nfurnished, particularly appointed for their reception when they come\namong them.  At the hours of dinner and supper the whole Syphogranty\nbeing called together by sound of trumpet, they meet and eat together,\nexcept only such as are in the hospitals or lie sick at home.  Yet, after\nthe halls are served, no man is hindered to carry provisions home from\nthe market-place, for they know that none does that but for some good\nreason; for though any that will may eat at home, yet none does it\nwillingly, since it is both ridiculous and foolish for any to give\nthemselves the trouble to make ready an ill dinner at home when there is\na much more plentiful one made ready for him so near hand.  All the\nuneasy and sordid services about these halls are performed by their\nslaves; but the dressing and cooking their meat, and the ordering their\ntables, belong only to the women, all those of every family taking it by\nturns.  They sit at three or more tables, according to their number; the\nmen sit towards the wall, and the women sit on the other side, that if\nany of them should be taken suddenly ill, which is no uncommon case\namongst women with child, she may, without disturbing the rest, rise and\ngo to the nurses' room (who are there with the sucking children), where\nthere is always clean water at hand and cradles, in which they may lay\nthe young children if there is occasion for it, and a fire, that they may\nshift and dress them before it.  Every child is nursed by its own mother\nif death or sickness does not intervene; and in that case the\nSyphogrants' wives find out a nurse quickly, which is no hard matter, for\nany one that can do it offers herself cheerfully; for as they are much\ninclined to that piece of mercy, so the child whom they nurse considers\nthe nurse as its mother.  All the children under five years old sit among\nthe nurses; the rest of the younger sort of both sexes, till they are fit\nfor marriage, either serve those that sit at table, or, if they are not\nstrong enough for that, stand by them in great silence and eat what is\ngiven them; nor have they any other formality of dining.  In the middle\nof the first table, which stands across the upper end of the hall, sit\nthe Syphogrant and his wife, for that is the chief and most conspicuous\nplace; next to him sit two of the most ancient, for there go always four\nto a mess.  If there is a temple within the Syphogranty, the Priest and\nhis wife sit with the Syphogrant above all the rest; next them there is a\nmixture of old and young, who are so placed that as the young are set\nnear others, so they are mixed with the more ancient; which, they say,\nwas appointed on this account: that the gravity of the old people, and\nthe reverence that is due to them, might restrain the younger from all\nindecent words and gestures.  Dishes are not served up to the whole table\nat first, but the best are first set before the old, whose seats are\ndistinguished from the young, and, after them, all the rest are served\nalike.  The old men distribute to the younger any curious meats that\nhappen to be set before them, if there is not such an abundance of them\nthat the whole company may be served alike.\n\n\"Thus old men are honoured with a particular respect, yet all the rest\nfare as well as they.  Both dinner and supper are begun with some lecture\nof morality that is read to them; but it is so short that it is not\ntedious nor uneasy to them to hear it.  From hence the old men take\noccasion to entertain those about them with some useful and pleasant\nenlargements; but they do not engross the whole discourse so to\nthemselves during their meals that the younger may not put in for a\nshare; on the contrary, they engage them to talk, that so they may, in\nthat free way of conversation, find out the force of every one's spirit\nand observe his temper.  They despatch their dinners quickly, but sit\nlong at supper, because they go to work after the one, and are to sleep\nafter the other, during which they think the stomach carries on the\nconcoction more vigorously.  They never sup without music, and there is\nalways fruit served up after meat; while they are at table some burn\nperfumes and sprinkle about fragrant ointments and sweet waters--in\nshort, they want nothing that may cheer up their spirits; they give\nthemselves a large allowance that way, and indulge themselves in all such\npleasures as are attended with no inconvenience.  Thus do those that are\nin the towns live together; but in the country, where they live at a\ngreat distance, every one eats at home, and no family wants any necessary\nsort of provision, for it is from them that provisions are sent unto\nthose that live in the towns.\n\n","chapter_length":1935.0,"summary_name":"Book II - Of their traffic","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210213064813\/https:\/\/www.novelguide.com\/utopia\/summaries\/bookii-of-their-traffic","summary_text":"Families are made up of people closely related to one another.

In time, Florence gives birth to a daughter, and while old Mr. Dombey shows great devotion to both of his grandchildren, he is especially attentive to his granddaughter, thereby atoning for the neglect he had shown to his daughter\", \"analysis\": \"Despite the personal tragedies that befall him with the loss of both of his wives, his son, and his daughter, the loss that finally pushes Dombey to his breaking point is the loss of his business. Importantly, the firm goes bankrupt not simply because of Carker's mismanagement but because of Dombey's pride and stubbornness, and his refusal to make the appropriate adjustments to his business practices. The collapse of the firm creates a second scandal following the dissolution of his marriage and completes the collapse of the Dombey reputation. Just as he has feared, he is the subject of gossip and speculation, and many individuals are somewhat pleased to see him humbled. Moreover, even characters like Bagstock and Mrs. Chick make it clear that they don't know how to relate to Dombey in his new position, and he loses the few superficial relationships he possessed. Dombey's isolation and humiliation, however, are the forces that finally break down his pride and stubbornness, allowing him both to reflect on his life and, for the first time, to recognize his mistakes. Once everyone else abandons him, he can finally see the value of Florence's unconditional love and loyalty. Now that he is no longer obsessed with lineage and wealth, he can see the value of her not as a commodity but as an individual who has suffered so patiently. Because Dombey is reduced to a state of humility and vulnerability, he can open his heart, and meet Florence with open arms when she returns to the house. Florence's decision to go back to her father's house when she returns to England may seem unconvincing, since she has been treated so badly by him, and has finally succeeded in establishing a new life for herself. However, now that she has become a mother, she seems to have an even deeper craving for connection to her own family. The next generation, first with her son and then with her daughter, functions as a source of redemption and new beginning. Florence's reestablishment of family is completed in that she not only reconciles with her father but also has a chance to say a final farewell to Edith. Even before Edith explains that she is not actually guilty of adultery, Florence is willing to show compassion to her. Edith's insistence on Florence knowing the truth rather than believing that she had an affair with Carker reveals the stigma around this behavior. While Edith was willing to sacrifice her public reputation to free herself from her marriage, she could bear to have Florence think of her as a fallen woman. A parallel is established between Edith and Alice in that Alice also seems to have been morally redeemed by the time of her death. Harriet's virtue and compassion, much like that of Florence, allows her to end the novel at peace. In typical Victorian novel fashion, many of the characters marry at the novel's conclusion. Some of these marriages seem improbable and abrupt, and may represent a last-minute desire to reassert the value of the domestic world after a novel that has been deeply critical of marriage and the family. What finally provides redemption is Dombey's reform. He not only reorients himself to a totally different kind of life and the companionship of characters far outside of his typical social circle, he also deliberately seeks to correct his past mistakes. This is seen most explicitly in his interactions with his granddaughter. He showers her with the love he has previously denied to his own child. While the errors of the past can never be undone, the novel ends with the suggestion that change and reform are possible even for the most unlikely characters.\"}","chapter":"\n\nA bottle that has been long excluded from the light of day, and is\nhoary with dust and cobwebs, has been brought into the sunshine; and the\ngolden wine within it sheds a lustre on the table.\n\nIt is the last bottle of the old Madiera.\n\n'You are quite right, Mr Gills,' says Mr Dombey. 'This is a very rare\nand most delicious wine.'\n\nThe Captain, who is of the party, beams with joy. There is a very halo\nof delight round his glowing forehead.\n\n'We always promised ourselves, Sir,' observes Mr Gills,' Ned and myself,\nI mean--'\n\nMr Dombey nods at the Captain, who shines more and more with speechless\ngratification.\n\n'--that we would drink this, one day or other, to Walter safe at home:\nthough such a home we never thought of. If you don't object to our old\nwhim, Sir, let us devote this first glass to Walter and his wife.'\n\n'To Walter and his wife!' says Mr Dombey. 'Florence, my child'--and\nturns to kiss her.\n\n'To Walter and his wife!' says Mr Toots.\n\n'To Wal'r and his wife!' exclaims the Captain. 'Hooroar!' and the\nCaptain exhibiting a strong desire to clink his glass against some other\nglass, Mr Dombey, with a ready hand, holds out his. The others follow;\nand there is a blithe and merry ringing, as of a little peal of marriage\nbells.\n\n\nOther buried wine grows older, as the old Madeira did in its time; and\ndust and cobwebs thicken on the bottles.\n\nMr Dombey is a white-haired gentleman, whose face bears heavy marks of\ncare and suffering; but they are traces of a storm that has passed on\nfor ever, and left a clear evening in its track.\n\nAmbitious projects trouble him no more. His only pride is in his\ndaughter and her husband. He has a silent, thoughtful, quiet manner, and\nis always with his daughter. Miss Tox is not infrequently of the family\nparty, and is quite devoted to it, and a great favourite. Her admiration\nof her once stately patron is, and has been ever since the morning of\nher shock in Princess's Place, platonic, but not weakened in the least.\n\nNothing has drifted to him from the wreck of his fortunes, but a certain\nannual sum that comes he knows not how, with an earnest entreaty that he\nwill not seek to discover, and with the assurance that it is a debt, and\nan act of reparation. He has consulted with his old clerk about this,\nwho is clear it may be honourably accepted, and has no doubt it arises\nout of some forgotten transaction in the times of the old House.\n\nThat hazel-eyed bachelor, a bachelor no more, is married now, and to the\nsister of the grey-haired Junior. He visits his old chief sometimes, but\nseldom. There is a reason in the greyhaired Junior's history, and yet\na stronger reason in his name, why he should keep retired from his\nold employer; and as he lives with his sister and her husband, they\nparticipate in that retirement. Walter sees them sometimes--Florence\ntoo--and the pleasant house resounds with profound duets arranged for\nthe Piano-Forte and Violoncello, and with the labours of Harmonious\nBlacksmiths.\n\nAnd how goes the wooden Midshipman in these changed days? Why, here he\nstill is, right leg foremost, hard at work upon the hackney coaches, and\nmore on the alert than ever, being newly painted from his cocked hat to\nhis buckled shoes; and up above him, in golden characters, these names\nshine refulgent, GILLS AND CUTTLE.\n\nNot another stroke of business does the Midshipman achieve beyond his\nusual easy trade. But they do say, in a circuit of some half-mile round\nthe blue umbrella in Leadenhall Market, that some of Mr Gills's old\ninvestments are coming out wonderfully well; and that instead of being\nbehind the time in those respects, as he supposed, he was, in truth,\na little before it, and had to wait the fulness of the time and the\ndesign. The whisper is that Mr Gills's money has begun to turn itself,\nand that it is turning itself over and over pretty briskly. Certain it\nis that, standing at his shop-door, in his coffee-coloured suit, with\nhis chronometer in his pocket, and his spectacles on his forehead, he\ndon't appear to break his heart at customers not coming, but looks very\njovial and contented, though full as misty as of yore.\n\nAs to his partner, Captain Cuttle, there is a fiction of a business in\nthe Captain's mind which is better than any reality. The Captain is as\nsatisfied of the Midshipman's importance to the commerce and navigation\nof the country, as he could possibly be, if no ship left the Port of\nLondon without the Midshipman's assistance. His delight in his own name\nover the door, is inexhaustible. He crosses the street, twenty times a\nday, to look at it from the other side of the way; and invariably says,\non these occasions, 'Ed'ard Cuttle, my lad, if your mother could ha'\nknow'd as you would ever be a man o' science, the good old creetur would\nha' been took aback in-deed!'\n\nBut here is Mr Toots descending on the Midshipman with violent rapidity,\nand Mr Toots's face is very red as he bursts into the little parlour.\n\n'Captain Gills,' says Mr Toots, 'and Mr Sols, I am happy to inform you\nthat Mrs Toots has had an increase to her family.'\n\n'And it does her credit!' cries the Captain.\n\n'I give you joy, Mr Toots!' says old Sol.\n\n'Thank'ee,' chuckles Mr Toots, 'I'm very much obliged to you. I knew\nthat you'd be glad to hear, and so I came down myself. We're positively\ngetting on, you know. There's Florence, and Susan, and now here's\nanother little stranger.'\n\n'A female stranger?' inquires the Captain.\n\n'Yes, Captain Gills,' says Mr Toots, 'and I'm glad of it. The oftener we\ncan repeat that most extraordinary woman, my opinion is, the better!'\n\n'Stand by!' says the Captain, turning to the old case-bottle with no\nthroat--for it is evening, and the Midshipman's usual moderate provision\nof pipes and glasses is on the board. 'Here's to her, and may she have\never so many more!'\n\n'Thank'ee, Captain Gills,' says the delighted Mr Toots. 'I echo the\nsentiment. If you'll allow me, as my so doing cannot be unpleasant to\nanybody, under the circumstances, I think I'll take a pipe.'\n\nMr Toots begins to smoke, accordingly, and in the openness of his heart\nis very loquacious.\n\n'Of all the remarkable instances that that delightful woman has given of\nher excellent sense, Captain Gills and Mr Sols,' said Mr Toots, 'I\nthink none is more remarkable than the perfection with which she has\nunderstood my devotion to Miss Dombey.'\n\nBoth his auditors assent.\n\n'Because you know,' says Mr Toots, 'I have never changed my sentiments\ntowards Miss Dombey. They are the same as ever. She is the same\nbright vision to me, at present, that she was before I made Walters's\nacquaintance. When Mrs Toots and myself first began to talk of--in\nshort, of the tender passion, you know, Captain Gills.'\n\n'Ay, ay, my lad,' says the Captain, 'as makes us all slue round--for\nwhich you'll overhaul the book--'\n\n'I shall certainly do so, Captain Gills,' says Mr Toots, with great\nearnestness; 'when we first began to mention such subjects, I explained\nthat I was what you may call a Blighted Flower, you know.'\n\nThe Captain approves of this figure greatly; and murmurs that no flower\nas blows, is like the rose.\n\n'But Lord bless me,' pursues Mr Toots, 'she was as entirely conscious of\nthe state of my feelings as I was myself. There was nothing I could tell\nher. She was the only person who could have stood between me and the\nsilent Tomb, and she did it, in a manner to command my everlasting\nadmiration. She knows that there's nobody in the world I look up to, as\nI do to Miss Dombey. Knows that there's nothing on earth I wouldn't\ndo for Miss Dombey. She knows that I consider Miss Dombey the most\nbeautiful, the most amiable, the most angelic of her sex. What is her\nobservation upon that? The perfection of sense. \"My dear, you're right.\nI think so too.\"'\n\n'And so do I!' says the Captain.\n\n'So do I,' says Sol Gills.\n\n'Then,' resumes Mr Toots, after some contemplative pulling at his pipe,\nduring which his visage has expressed the most contented reflection,\n'what an observant woman my wife is! What sagacity she possesses! What\nremarks she makes! It was only last night, when we were sitting in\nthe enjoyment of connubial bliss--which, upon my word and honour, is a\nfeeble term to express my feelings in the society of my wife--that\nshe said how remarkable it was to consider the present position of\nour friend Walters. \"Here,\" observes my wife, \"he is, released from\nsea-going, after that first long voyage with his young bride\"--as you\nknow he was, Mr Sols.'\n\n'Quite true,' says the old Instrument-maker, rubbing his hands.\n\n'\"Here he is,\" says my wife, \"released from that, immediately; appointed\nby the same establishment to a post of great trust and confidence at\nhome; showing himself again worthy; mounting up the ladder with the\ngreatest expedition; beloved by everybody; assisted by his uncle at the\nvery best possible time of his fortunes\"--which I think is the case, Mr\nSols? My wife is always correct.'\n\n'Why yes, yes--some of our lost ships, freighted with gold, have come\nhome, truly,' returns old Sol, laughing. 'Small craft, Mr Toots, but\nserviceable to my boy!'\n\n'Exactly so,' says Mr Toots. 'You'll never find my wife wrong. \"Here he\nis,\" says that most remarkable woman, \"so situated,--and what follows?\nWhat follows?\" observed Mrs Toots. Now pray remark, Captain Gills, and\nMr Sols, the depth of my wife's penetration. \"Why that, under the very\neye of Mr Dombey, there is a foundation going on, upon which a--an\nEdifice;\" that was Mrs Toots's word,' says Mr Toots exultingly, \"'is\ngradually rising, perhaps to equal, perhaps excel, that of which he was\nonce the head, and the small beginnings of which (a common fault, but a\nbad one, Mrs Toots said) escaped his memory. Thus,\" said my wife, \"from\nhis daughter, after all, another Dombey and Son will ascend\"--no \"rise;\"\nthat was Mrs Toots's word--\"triumphant!\"'\n\nMr Toots, with the assistance of his pipe--which he is extremely glad to\ndevote to oratorical purposes, as its proper use affects him with a\nvery uncomfortable sensation--does such grand justice to this prophetic\nsentence of his wife's, that the Captain, throwing away his glazed hat\nin a state of the greatest excitement, cries:\n\n'Sol Gills, you man of science and my ould pardner, what did I tell\nWal'r to overhaul on that there night when he first took to business?\nWas it this here quotation, \"Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of\nLondon, and when you are old you will never depart from it.\" Was it them\nwords, Sol Gills?'\n\n'It certainly was, Ned,' replied the old Instrument-maker. 'I remember\nwell.'\n\n'Then I tell you what,' says the Captain, leaning back in his chair,\nand composing his chest for a prodigious roar. 'I'll give you Lovely Peg\nright through; and stand by, both on you, for the chorus!'\n\n\nBuried wine grows older, as the old Madeira did, in its time; and dust\nand cobwebs thicken on the bottles.\n\nAutumn days are shining, and on the sea-beach there are often a young\nlady, and a white-haired gentleman. With them, or near them, are two\nchildren: boy and girl. And an old dog is generally in their company.\n\nThe white-haired gentleman walks with the little boy, talks with him,\nhelps him in his play, attends upon him, watches him as if he were the\nobject of his life. If he be thoughtful, the white-haired gentleman is\nthoughtful too; and sometimes when the child is sitting by his side, and\nlooks up in his face, asking him questions, he takes the tiny hand in\nhis, and holding it, forgets to answer. Then the child says:\n\n'What, grandpa! Am I so like my poor little Uncle again?'\n\n'Yes, Paul. But he was weak, and you are very strong.'\n\n'Oh yes, I am very strong.'\n\n'And he lay on a little bed beside the sea, and you can run about.'\n\nAnd so they range away again, busily, for the white-haired gentleman\nlikes best to see the child free and stirring; and as they go about\ntogether, the story of the bond between them goes about, and follows\nthem.\n\nBut no one, except Florence, knows the measure of the white-haired\ngentleman's affection for the girl. That story never goes about. The\nchild herself almost wonders at a certain secrecy he keeps in it. He\nhoards her in his heart. He cannot bear to see a cloud upon her face.\nHe cannot bear to see her sit apart. He fancies that she feels a slight,\nwhen there is none. He steals away to look at her, in her sleep. It\npleases him to have her come, and wake him in the morning. He is fondest\nof her and most loving to her, when there is no creature by. The child\nsays then, sometimes:\n\n'Dear grandpapa, why do you cry when you kiss me?'\n\nHe only answers, 'Little Florence! little Florence!' and smooths away\nthe curls that shade her earnest eyes.\n\nThe voices in the waves speak low to him of Florence, day and\nnight--plainest when he, his blooming daughter, and her husband, beside\nthem in the evening, or sit at an open window, listening to their roar.\nThey speak to him of Florence and his altered heart; of Florence and\ntheir ceaseless murmuring to her of the love, eternal and illimitable,\nextending still, beyond the sea, beyond the sky, to the invisible\ncountry far away.\n\nNever from the mighty sea may voices rise too late, to come between us\nand the unseen region on the other shore! Better, far better, that\nthey whispered of that region in our childish ears, and the swift river\nhurried us away!\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE OF 1848\n\nI cannot forego my usual opportunity of saying farewell to my readers\nin this greeting-place, though I have only to acknowledge the unbounded\nwarmth and earnestness of their sympathy in every stage of the journey\nwe have just concluded.\n\nIf any of them have felt a sorrow in one of the principal incidents on\nwhich this fiction turns, I hope it may be a sorrow of that sort which\nendears the sharers in it, one to another. This is not unselfish in me.\nI may claim to have felt it, at least as much as anybody else; and I\nwould fain be remembered kindly for my part in the experience.\n\n\nDEVONSHIRE TERRACE, Twenty-Fourth March, 1848.\n\n\nPREFACE OF 1867\n\nI make so bold as to believe that the faculty (or the habit) of\ncorrectly observing the characters of men, is a rare one. I have not\neven found, within my experience, that the faculty (or the habit) of\ncorrectly observing so much as the faces of men, is a general one by any\nmeans. The two commonest mistakes in judgement that I suppose to\narise from the former default, are, the confounding of shyness with\narrogance--a very common mistake indeed--and the not understanding that\nan obstinate nature exists in a perpetual struggle with itself.\n\nMr Dombey undergoes no violent change, either in this book, or in real\nlife. A sense of his injustice is within him, all along. The more he\nrepresses it, the more unjust he necessarily is. Internal shame and\nexternal circumstances may bring the contest to a close in a week, or a\nday; but, it has been a contest for years, and is only fought out after\na long balance of victory.\n\nI began this book by the Lake of Geneva, and went on with it for some\nmonths in France, before pursuing it in England. The association between\nthe writing and the place of writing is so curiously strong in my mind,\nthat at this day, although I know, in my fancy, every stair in the\nlittle midshipman's house, and could swear to every pew in the church\nin which Florence was married, or to every young gentleman's bedstead in\nDoctor Blimber's establishment, I yet confusedly imagine Captain\nCuttle as secluding himself from Mrs MacStinger among the mountains of\nSwitzerland. Similarly, when I am reminded by any chance of what it was\nthat the waves were always saying, my remembrance wanders for a whole\nwinter night about the streets of Paris--as I restlessly did with a\nheavy heart, on the night when I had written the chapter in which my\nlittle friend and I parted company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2559.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 62","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200917203216\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/dombey-and-son\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-58-62","summary_text":"Mr. Dombey gradually recovers, but displays a very different personality, being humble and loving to his daughter and son-in-law.

They fail to note that it is not Hero, but instead Margaret. This is fabrication through substitution, and it leads Don John to stand condemned at the end of the play. This scene also plays on men's fears of female infidelity. Claudio tells us, \\\"If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed, there will I shame her\\\" . This fear is so strong that Benedick declared himself a bachelor as a result, he is terrified of wearing bull's horns, a sign of the cuckold. Gardens are again dangerous places to be. Hero and Ursula are talking in the orchard. This is not merely a plot against Beatrice, but also against female virginity. In fact, gardens can be seen as representing the female sexuality, and they are dangerous places because they are where virginity is compromised. This can be seen when Claudio convinces Don Pedro to win him Hero's heart, a scene that takes place in a garden. In this act, Beatrice will be tricked into loving Benedick by what she overhears in an orchard. Indeed, Hero's reputation, and also Claudio's perception of her virginity, is lost when Claudio and Don Pedro stand in the orchard and watch Borachio woo Margaret. The only way to clear up the confusion inherent in the play is to write everything down. Writing becomes a way of clarifying and clearing up the mistakes. Dogberry says, \\\"get the learned writer to set down our excommunication \\\" . This is the first point in the play where writing appears. It will later be used by Benedick and Beatrice, the Sexton, and Claudio who will write the epitaph to Hero.\"}","chapter":"Scene V.\n\nThe hall in Leonato's house.\n\n[Enter Leonato and the Constable [Dogberry] and the\nHeadborough[verges.]\n\nLeon.\nWhat would you with me, honest neighbour?\n\nDog.\nMarry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns\nyou nearly.\n\nLeon.\nBrief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.\n\nDog.\nMarry, this it is, sir.\n\nVerg.\nYes, in truth it is, sir.\n\nLeon.\nWhat is it, my good friends?\n\nDog.\nGoodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter--an old man,\nsir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire\nthey were; but, in faith, honest as the skin between his\nbrows.\n\nVerg.\nYes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old\nman and no honester than I.\n\nDog.\nComparisons are odorous.

They fail to note that it is not Hero, but instead Margaret. This is fabrication through substitution, and it leads Don John to stand condemned at the end of the play. This scene also plays on men's fears of female infidelity. Claudio tells us, \"If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her, tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed, there will I shame her\" . This fear is so strong that Benedick declared himself a bachelor as a result, he is terrified of wearing bull's horns, a sign of the cuckold. Gardens are again dangerous places to be. Hero and Ursula are talking in the orchard. This is not merely a plot against Beatrice, but also against female virginity. In fact, gardens can be seen as representing the female sexuality, and they are dangerous places because they are where virginity is compromised. This can be seen when Claudio convinces Don Pedro to win him Hero's heart, a scene that takes place in a garden. In this act, Beatrice will be tricked into loving Benedick by what she overhears in an orchard. Indeed, Hero's reputation, and also Claudio's perception of her virginity, is lost when Claudio and Don Pedro stand in the orchard and watch Borachio woo Margaret. The only way to clear up the confusion inherent in the play is to write everything down. Writing becomes a way of clarifying and clearing up the mistakes. Dogberry says, \"get the learned writer to set down our excommunication \" . This is the first point in the play where writing appears. It will later be used by Benedick and Beatrice, the Sexton, and Claudio who will write the epitaph to Hero.","summary_length":69.0,"analysis_length":312.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["act 3 scene 4","act 5 scene 4","act iii, scene iv","act v, scene iv","scene 4","scene 4","act iii, scene iv","act v, scene iv","act 3, scene 4","act 5, scene 4","act 3, scene 4","act 5, scene 4"],"previous chapter":["Hero is getting dressed by Margaret for her wedding that day.

Hero has sent Ursula off to go get Beatrice, and Margaret is helping Hero get dressed. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Margaret describes the beautiful dress Hero will wear as full of gold, silver, and pearls, but Hero seems uncomfortable. Hero hopes the dress will bring her joy, because she says her heart is heavy. Instead of noting that Hero is clearly unhappy and has a weird feeling, Margaret makes a joke about the fact that soon, Hero's chest will be heavy under the weight of a husband. Hey-o! These people and their cheap sex jokes. Beatrice enters and, as usual, becomes the focus of attention. She says she doesn't feel well. When she sighs, Margaret asks her if she's sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. She says she's sighing because of an \"H,\" a pun on \"ache.\" At one point Beatrice says she's stuffed, as in congested, but Margaret turns it into a dirty joke, and says, \"Stuffed? That's quite a way for a young, unmarried woman to catch a cold!\" Beatrice wonders when Margaret became so witty, but the last straw is when Margaret suggests Beatrice could be cured of her ailment by some holy thistle that just happens to be named carduus benedictus. Her hints are getting pretty obvious. Beatrice flips out. In response to Beatrice's tizzy, Margaret says she didn't mean anything special by using the name carduus benedictus. She just meant regular old thistle. And of course, she doesn't think Beatrice is in love. That would be ridiculous. Although... Benedick used to share Beatrice's views on the absurdity of love, but he's obviously all-in now. Margaret finishes by saying that she doesn't know how it happened, but it seems to her that Beatrice's views on love have changed, too. She suddenly seems to be looking at love the way other women do. Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.","At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Everyone's glad that Hero is innocent. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. He says that Beatrice loves him , and the he loves Beatrice . Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Claudio takes the mystery girl's hand and swears that he's her husband, if she'll have him. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Hero says that the Hero who was slandered is dead, but this Hero--who is still an innocent maiden--lives. Prince Don Pedro then declares this is the former Hero, the one that's dead. Um...at least they're getting warmer. Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Beatrice steps forth, and then she and Benedick engage in the most silly, passive aggressive exchanges ever to happen between two lovesick people. Benedick publicly asks Beatrice if she loves him, and she denies it --kind of. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. They're about to shake hands and relegate each other to a life of being in simply the friend zone, but thankfully Hero and Claudio pipe up. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize their hands have revealed their hearts. Though they tease that they're only marrying each other out of pity, they finally just start making out . Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.","Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Hero sends Ursula to bring Beatrice. Margaret is critical of what Hero has chosen to wear but quickly backs off when Hero scolds her lightly. Margaret also teases Hero about Claudio and his soon-to-be presence in her bed. When Beatrice arrives, she says that she is not feeling well. Margaret teases her that she is sick with love. Ursula returns to tell them that the men have come to take Hero to the church.","The play's final scene begins with the friar's reminder to everyone -- Leonato, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, and Benedick -- that he never doubted Hero's innocence. Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. The ladies leave to cover their faces with veils. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio. As soon as Claudio vows publicly to marry this stranger, Hero reveals her identity to the amazement of Claudio and Don Pedro. Once again Claudio is overcome with love for Hero. Meanwhile, Benedick asks which of the veiled ladies is Beatrice and asks if she loves him. Their usual denials and quick repartee continue until Claudio and Hero each produces love poems Beatrice and Benedick have written to one another. Finally, they happily accept each other. At Benedick's suggestion, dancing begins even before the marriage ceremony. A messenger interrupts the festivities with the news that Don John has been taken prisoner and is being brought back to Messina. Benedick suggests that they think about Don John tomorrow, when Benedick will invent appropriate punishments for him.","On the morning of her wedding to Claudio, Hero wakes up early and tells her servant Ursula to wake Beatrice. Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice arrives, and Margaret, in high spirits, teases her about her changed personality, saying that now Beatrice too desires a husband. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church. They all set off together","Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music","The plot does not move much in this scene. Hero is dressing up for the wedding. Margaret seems innocent of the evil that the audience knows she has participated in, armed with a sharp wit and a friendly disposition. She says that Hero's heart will be heavier by the weight of a man-a veiled reference to marital union. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.","Claudio and Don Pedro call on Leonato and Antonio as per the agreement. All the ladies of the house are masked. Leonato presents one of them to Claudio as Antonio's daughter whom he shall marry. Claudio accepts her hand. When she takes off her mask, he is shocked to find that she is Hero herself. Don Pedro and Claudio are glad that Hero is not indeed dead, as they had been made to believe. Benedick now announces his decision to get married, of course, to Beatrice. The play ends with the news that Don John has been captured and all the characters proceed to dance.","It is the wedding day and Hero is busy with preparations for the event. Beatrice enters and seems to be out of spirits. Margaret and Beatrice playfully exchange taunts. Then, Margaret tells Beatrice that she doesn't know why Benedick is suddenly so forlorn and subdued. Much to Beatrice's horror, she wonders aloud if the two are in love.","The next day, Friar Francis is happy that his hunch about Hero's innocence is correct. Leonato asks all the women to withdraw into a chamber and return masked when they are called for. In the meantime, Benedick confesses his love for Beatrice to the friar and Leonato. Don Pedro and Claudio arrive at the church and are ready for the wedding. Antonio escorts the women outside and Claudio is confused at who is to be his future bride, since all the women are masked. Leonato tells Claudio that he cannot see his new bride's face until they have been married. After the ceremony, the bride takes off her mask, revealing that she is none other than Hero. Claudio is overcome with joy but is amazed that she is alive. Friar Francis promises to tell everyone about Hero's \"death\" later on. Since the mood in the church is so happy, Benedick asks Beatrice to proclaim her love for him. They both realize that Don Pedro and Hero tricked them into loving each other. Benedick and Beatrice are happily united and everyone is merry. A messenger informs the group that Don John has come back with armed men to Messina to fight his brother. Benedick tells everyone to dance and have fun and forget about Don John until tomorrow."],"next summary id":"act 3 scene 5","next chapter":"Dogberry has gone to Leonato to inform him that two suspicious men were arrested the night before.

Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.","At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Everyone's glad that Hero is innocent. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. He says that Beatrice loves him , and the he loves Beatrice . Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Claudio takes the mystery girl's hand and swears that he's her husband, if she'll have him. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Hero says that the Hero who was slandered is dead, but this Hero--who is still an innocent maiden--lives. Prince Don Pedro then declares this is the former Hero, the one that's dead. Um...at least they're getting warmer. Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Beatrice steps forth, and then she and Benedick engage in the most silly, passive aggressive exchanges ever to happen between two lovesick people. Benedick publicly asks Beatrice if she loves him, and she denies it --kind of. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. They're about to shake hands and relegate each other to a life of being in simply the friend zone, but thankfully Hero and Claudio pipe up. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize their hands have revealed their hearts. Though they tease that they're only marrying each other out of pity, they finally just start making out . Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.","Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Hero sends Ursula to bring Beatrice. Margaret is critical of what Hero has chosen to wear but quickly backs off when Hero scolds her lightly. Margaret also teases Hero about Claudio and his soon-to-be presence in her bed. When Beatrice arrives, she says that she is not feeling well. Margaret teases her that she is sick with love. Ursula returns to tell them that the men have come to take Hero to the church.","The play's final scene begins with the friar's reminder to everyone -- Leonato, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, and Benedick -- that he never doubted Hero's innocence. Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. The ladies leave to cover their faces with veils. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio. As soon as Claudio vows publicly to marry this stranger, Hero reveals her identity to the amazement of Claudio and Don Pedro. Once again Claudio is overcome with love for Hero. Meanwhile, Benedick asks which of the veiled ladies is Beatrice and asks if she loves him. Their usual denials and quick repartee continue until Claudio and Hero each produces love poems Beatrice and Benedick have written to one another. Finally, they happily accept each other. At Benedick's suggestion, dancing begins even before the marriage ceremony. A messenger interrupts the festivities with the news that Don John has been taken prisoner and is being brought back to Messina. Benedick suggests that they think about Don John tomorrow, when Benedick will invent appropriate punishments for him.","On the morning of her wedding to Claudio, Hero wakes up early and tells her servant Ursula to wake Beatrice. Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice arrives, and Margaret, in high spirits, teases her about her changed personality, saying that now Beatrice too desires a husband. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church. They all set off together","Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music","The plot does not move much in this scene. Hero is dressing up for the wedding. Margaret seems innocent of the evil that the audience knows she has participated in, armed with a sharp wit and a friendly disposition. She says that Hero's heart will be heavier by the weight of a man-a veiled reference to marital union. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.","Claudio and Don Pedro call on Leonato and Antonio as per the agreement. All the ladies of the house are masked. Leonato presents one of them to Claudio as Antonio's daughter whom he shall marry. Claudio accepts her hand. When she takes off her mask, he is shocked to find that she is Hero herself. Don Pedro and Claudio are glad that Hero is not indeed dead, as they had been made to believe. Benedick now announces his decision to get married, of course, to Beatrice. The play ends with the news that Don John has been captured and all the characters proceed to dance.","It is the wedding day and Hero is busy with preparations for the event. Beatrice enters and seems to be out of spirits. Margaret and Beatrice playfully exchange taunts. Then, Margaret tells Beatrice that she doesn't know why Benedick is suddenly so forlorn and subdued. Much to Beatrice's horror, she wonders aloud if the two are in love.","The next day, Friar Francis is happy that his hunch about Hero's innocence is correct. Leonato asks all the women to withdraw into a chamber and return masked when they are called for. In the meantime, Benedick confesses his love for Beatrice to the friar and Leonato. Don Pedro and Claudio arrive at the church and are ready for the wedding. Antonio escorts the women outside and Claudio is confused at who is to be his future bride, since all the women are masked. Leonato tells Claudio that he cannot see his new bride's face until they have been married. After the ceremony, the bride takes off her mask, revealing that she is none other than Hero. Claudio is overcome with joy but is amazed that she is alive. Friar Francis promises to tell everyone about Hero's \"death\" later on. Since the mood in the church is so happy, Benedick asks Beatrice to proclaim her love for him. They both realize that Don Pedro and Hero tricked them into loving each other. Benedick and Beatrice are happily united and everyone is merry. A messenger informs the group that Don John has come back with armed men to Messina to fight his brother. Benedick tells everyone to dance and have fun and forget about Don John until tomorrow."],"next summary id":"act iii, scene v","next chapter":"Dogberry and Verges arrive at the door of Leonato's house to tell him something very important. Leonato says he's busy, but asks them what's up. Dogberry and Verges spend some time talking about how honest they both are, and Leonato tells them they are tedious. Dogberry thanks him, thinking that was a compliment, and says that even if he were as tedious as a king , he'd be happy to give all of his tediousness to Leonato. \"Gee, thanks,\" says Leonato. \"Now what do you want?\" Dogberry and Verges finally get to the point. Sort of. They say they've captured two knaves, and they'd like to examine these men in Leonato's presence. Unfortunately, this simple message is really poorly delivered, and Dogberry and Verges manage to totally obscure their meaning. Leonato is kind of occupied trying to get his daughter married, and he tells Dogberry and Verges to do the examination themselves, and report back to him on the outcome. A messenger arrives to tell Leonato it's time for him to give his daughter away, and they leave together. Dogberry tells Verges to get Francis Seacoal to meet them at the station. Seacoal is one of those fancypants guys who can read and write, so they'll have him transcribe the interrogation . This should be good."}

Ursula interrupts her and informs Hero that the men are all gathered to take her to the church","Leonato sends the woman into their chambers and orders them to come out masked when they are called for. Antonio has promised to pretend that Hero is his daughter so Claudio will believe he is marrying Hero's cousin. Benedick then asks Leonato for permission to marry Beatrice at the same wedding ceremony. Leonato agrees to the marriage. Claudio and Don Pedro arrive and are greeted. The women then come out wearing masks to hide their identities. Claudio asks which lady he shall marry, and Antonio gives him Hero. She unmasks herself, causing Claudio to cry out, \"Another Hero.

Hero has sent Ursula off to go get Beatrice, and Margaret is helping Hero get dressed. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Margaret describes the beautiful dress Hero will wear as full of gold, silver, and pearls, but Hero seems uncomfortable. Hero hopes the dress will bring her joy, because she says her heart is heavy. Instead of noting that Hero is clearly unhappy and has a weird feeling, Margaret makes a joke about the fact that soon, Hero's chest will be heavy under the weight of a husband. Hey-o! These people and their cheap sex jokes. Beatrice enters and, as usual, becomes the focus of attention. She says she doesn't feel well. When she sighs, Margaret asks her if she's sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. She says she's sighing because of an \"H,\" a pun on \"ache.\" At one point Beatrice says she's stuffed, as in congested, but Margaret turns it into a dirty joke, and says, \"Stuffed? That's quite a way for a young, unmarried woman to catch a cold!\" Beatrice wonders when Margaret became so witty, but the last straw is when Margaret suggests Beatrice could be cured of her ailment by some holy thistle that just happens to be named carduus benedictus. Her hints are getting pretty obvious. Beatrice flips out. In response to Beatrice's tizzy, Margaret says she didn't mean anything special by using the name carduus benedictus. She just meant regular old thistle. And of course, she doesn't think Beatrice is in love. That would be ridiculous. Although... Benedick used to share Beatrice's views on the absurdity of love, but he's obviously all-in now. Margaret finishes by saying that she doesn't know how it happened, but it seems to her that Beatrice's views on love have changed, too.

Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music","The plot does not move much in this scene. Hero is dressing up for the wedding. Margaret seems innocent of the evil that the audience knows she has participated in, armed with a sharp wit and a friendly disposition. She says that Hero's heart will be heavier by the weight of a man-a veiled reference to marital union. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.","Claudio and Don Pedro call on Leonato and Antonio as per the agreement. All the ladies of the house are masked. Leonato presents one of them to Claudio as Antonio's daughter whom he shall marry. Claudio accepts her hand. When she takes off her mask, he is shocked to find that she is Hero herself. Don Pedro and Claudio are glad that Hero is not indeed dead, as they had been made to believe. Benedick now announces his decision to get married, of course, to Beatrice. The play ends with the news that Don John has been captured and all the characters proceed to dance.","It is the wedding day and Hero is busy with preparations for the event. Beatrice enters and seems to be out of spirits. Margaret and Beatrice playfully exchange taunts. Then, Margaret tells Beatrice that she doesn't know why Benedick is suddenly so forlorn and subdued. Much to Beatrice's horror, she wonders aloud if the two are in love.","The next day, Friar Francis is happy that his hunch about Hero's innocence is correct. Leonato asks all the women to withdraw into a chamber and return masked when they are called for. In the meantime, Benedick confesses his love for Beatrice to the friar and Leonato. Don Pedro and Claudio arrive at the church and are ready for the wedding. Antonio escorts the women outside and Claudio is confused at who is to be his future bride, since all the women are masked. Leonato tells Claudio that he cannot see his new bride's face until they have been married. After the ceremony, the bride takes off her mask, revealing that she is none other than Hero. Claudio is overcome with joy but is amazed that she is alive. Friar Francis promises to tell everyone about Hero's \"death\" later on. Since the mood in the church is so happy, Benedick asks Beatrice to proclaim her love for him. They both realize that Don Pedro and Hero tricked them into loving each other. Benedick and Beatrice are happily united and everyone is merry. A messenger informs the group that Don John has come back with armed men to Messina to fight his brother. Benedick tells everyone to dance and have fun and forget about Don John until tomorrow."],"next summary id":"scene 5","next chapter":"Dogberry and Verges stop Leonato on his way to the wedding.

She sends Ursula to fetch Beatrice, who arrives but has lost her wittiness and has also caught a cold. Margaret makes severally sexually explicit puns before mentioning to Beatrice that Benedick is now in love. Margaret then implies that perhaps Beatrice will someday decide to fall in love much the Benedick has. Ursula interrupts her and informs Hero that the men are all gathered to take her to the church","Leonato sends the woman into their chambers and orders them to come out masked when they are called for. Antonio has promised to pretend that Hero is his daughter so Claudio will believe he is marrying Hero's cousin. Benedick then asks Leonato for permission to marry Beatrice at the same wedding ceremony. Leonato agrees to the marriage. Claudio and Don Pedro arrive and are greeted. The women then come out wearing masks to hide their identities. Claudio asks which lady he shall marry, and Antonio gives him Hero. She unmasks herself, causing Claudio to cry out, \"Another Hero. She replies, \"Nothing certainer\". At the wedding Benedick calls for Beatrice to reveal herself. She does, and he asks her if she loves him. Beatrice gives the surprisingly cold answer, \"Why no, no more than reason\". Benedick admits the same thing, and they both realize that they were set up by their friends. Watching this extraordinary exchange, Claudio and Hero pull out sonnets that Benedick and Beatrice wrote to each other and show them as proof that they really do love each other. Benedick states, \"A miracle. Here's our own hands against our hearts\". Benedick and Claudio reconcile their friendship and tell Don Pedro to find himself a wife so he is not alone. A messenger arrives at the very end and informs them that Don John has been captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick tells them, \"Think not on him till tomorrow, I'll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers\"","It's the morning of the wedding, and the scene is set in Hero's bedroom. Hero has sent Ursula off to go get Beatrice, and Margaret is helping Hero get dressed. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Margaret describes the beautiful dress Hero will wear as full of gold, silver, and pearls, but Hero seems uncomfortable. Hero hopes the dress will bring her joy, because she says her heart is heavy. Instead of noting that Hero is clearly unhappy and has a weird feeling, Margaret makes a joke about the fact that soon, Hero's chest will be heavy under the weight of a husband. Hey-o! These people and their cheap sex jokes. Beatrice enters and, as usual, becomes the focus of attention. She says she doesn't feel well. When she sighs, Margaret asks her if she's sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. She says she's sighing because of an \"H,\" a pun on \"ache.\" At one point Beatrice says she's stuffed, as in congested, but Margaret turns it into a dirty joke, and says, \"Stuffed? That's quite a way for a young, unmarried woman to catch a cold!\" Beatrice wonders when Margaret became so witty, but the last straw is when Margaret suggests Beatrice could be cured of her ailment by some holy thistle that just happens to be named carduus benedictus. Her hints are getting pretty obvious. Beatrice flips out. In response to Beatrice's tizzy, Margaret says she didn't mean anything special by using the name carduus benedictus. She just meant regular old thistle. And of course, she doesn't think Beatrice is in love. That would be ridiculous. Although... Benedick used to share Beatrice's views on the absurdity of love, but he's obviously all-in now. Margaret finishes by saying that she doesn't know how it happened, but it seems to her that Beatrice's views on love have changed, too. She suddenly seems to be looking at love the way other women do. Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.","At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Everyone's glad that Hero is innocent. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. He says that Beatrice loves him , and the he loves Beatrice . Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Claudio takes the mystery girl's hand and swears that he's her husband, if she'll have him. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Hero says that the Hero who was slandered is dead, but this Hero--who is still an innocent maiden--lives. Prince Don Pedro then declares this is the former Hero, the one that's dead. Um...at least they're getting warmer. Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Beatrice steps forth, and then she and Benedick engage in the most silly, passive aggressive exchanges ever to happen between two lovesick people. Benedick publicly asks Beatrice if she loves him, and she denies it --kind of. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. They're about to shake hands and relegate each other to a life of being in simply the friend zone, but thankfully Hero and Claudio pipe up. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize their hands have revealed their hearts. Though they tease that they're only marrying each other out of pity, they finally just start making out . Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.","Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Hero sends Ursula to bring Beatrice. Margaret is critical of what Hero has chosen to wear but quickly backs off when Hero scolds her lightly. Margaret also teases Hero about Claudio and his soon-to-be presence in her bed. When Beatrice arrives, she says that she is not feeling well. Margaret teases her that she is sick with love. Ursula returns to tell them that the men have come to take Hero to the church.","The play's final scene begins with the friar's reminder to everyone -- Leonato, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, and Benedick -- that he never doubted Hero's innocence. Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. The ladies leave to cover their faces with veils. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio. As soon as Claudio vows publicly to marry this stranger, Hero reveals her identity to the amazement of Claudio and Don Pedro. Once again Claudio is overcome with love for Hero. Meanwhile, Benedick asks which of the veiled ladies is Beatrice and asks if she loves him. Their usual denials and quick repartee continue until Claudio and Hero each produces love poems Beatrice and Benedick have written to one another. Finally, they happily accept each other. At Benedick's suggestion, dancing begins even before the marriage ceremony. A messenger interrupts the festivities with the news that Don John has been taken prisoner and is being brought back to Messina. Benedick suggests that they think about Don John tomorrow, when Benedick will invent appropriate punishments for him.","On the morning of her wedding to Claudio, Hero wakes up early and tells her servant Ursula to wake Beatrice. Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice arrives, and Margaret, in high spirits, teases her about her changed personality, saying that now Beatrice too desires a husband. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church. They all set off together","Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music","The plot does not move much in this scene. Hero is dressing up for the wedding. Margaret seems innocent of the evil that the audience knows she has participated in, armed with a sharp wit and a friendly disposition. She says that Hero's heart will be heavier by the weight of a man-a veiled reference to marital union. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.","Claudio and Don Pedro call on Leonato and Antonio as per the agreement. All the ladies of the house are masked. Leonato presents one of them to Claudio as Antonio's daughter whom he shall marry. Claudio accepts her hand. When she takes off her mask, he is shocked to find that she is Hero herself. Don Pedro and Claudio are glad that Hero is not indeed dead, as they had been made to believe. Benedick now announces his decision to get married, of course, to Beatrice.

Margaret then implies that perhaps Beatrice will someday decide to fall in love much the Benedick has. Ursula interrupts her and informs Hero that the men are all gathered to take her to the church","Leonato sends the woman into their chambers and orders them to come out masked when they are called for. Antonio has promised to pretend that Hero is his daughter so Claudio will believe he is marrying Hero's cousin. Benedick then asks Leonato for permission to marry Beatrice at the same wedding ceremony. Leonato agrees to the marriage. Claudio and Don Pedro arrive and are greeted. The women then come out wearing masks to hide their identities. Claudio asks which lady he shall marry, and Antonio gives him Hero. She unmasks herself, causing Claudio to cry out, \"Another Hero. She replies, \"Nothing certainer\". At the wedding Benedick calls for Beatrice to reveal herself. She does, and he asks her if she loves him. Beatrice gives the surprisingly cold answer, \"Why no, no more than reason\". Benedick admits the same thing, and they both realize that they were set up by their friends. Watching this extraordinary exchange, Claudio and Hero pull out sonnets that Benedick and Beatrice wrote to each other and show them as proof that they really do love each other. Benedick states, \"A miracle. Here's our own hands against our hearts\". Benedick and Claudio reconcile their friendship and tell Don Pedro to find himself a wife so he is not alone. A messenger arrives at the very end and informs them that Don John has been captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick tells them, \"Think not on him till tomorrow, I'll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers\"","It's the morning of the wedding, and the scene is set in Hero's bedroom. Hero has sent Ursula off to go get Beatrice, and Margaret is helping Hero get dressed. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Margaret describes the beautiful dress Hero will wear as full of gold, silver, and pearls, but Hero seems uncomfortable. Hero hopes the dress will bring her joy, because she says her heart is heavy. Instead of noting that Hero is clearly unhappy and has a weird feeling, Margaret makes a joke about the fact that soon, Hero's chest will be heavy under the weight of a husband. Hey-o! These people and their cheap sex jokes. Beatrice enters and, as usual, becomes the focus of attention. She says she doesn't feel well. When she sighs, Margaret asks her if she's sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. She says she's sighing because of an \"H,\" a pun on \"ache.\" At one point Beatrice says she's stuffed, as in congested, but Margaret turns it into a dirty joke, and says, \"Stuffed? That's quite a way for a young, unmarried woman to catch a cold!\" Beatrice wonders when Margaret became so witty, but the last straw is when Margaret suggests Beatrice could be cured of her ailment by some holy thistle that just happens to be named carduus benedictus. Her hints are getting pretty obvious. Beatrice flips out. In response to Beatrice's tizzy, Margaret says she didn't mean anything special by using the name carduus benedictus. She just meant regular old thistle. And of course, she doesn't think Beatrice is in love. That would be ridiculous. Although... Benedick used to share Beatrice's views on the absurdity of love, but he's obviously all-in now. Margaret finishes by saying that she doesn't know how it happened, but it seems to her that Beatrice's views on love have changed, too. She suddenly seems to be looking at love the way other women do. Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.","At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Everyone's glad that Hero is innocent. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. He says that Beatrice loves him , and the he loves Beatrice . Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Claudio takes the mystery girl's hand and swears that he's her husband, if she'll have him. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Hero says that the Hero who was slandered is dead, but this Hero--who is still an innocent maiden--lives. Prince Don Pedro then declares this is the former Hero, the one that's dead. Um...at least they're getting warmer. Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Beatrice steps forth, and then she and Benedick engage in the most silly, passive aggressive exchanges ever to happen between two lovesick people. Benedick publicly asks Beatrice if she loves him, and she denies it --kind of. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. They're about to shake hands and relegate each other to a life of being in simply the friend zone, but thankfully Hero and Claudio pipe up. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize their hands have revealed their hearts. Though they tease that they're only marrying each other out of pity, they finally just start making out . Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.","Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Hero sends Ursula to bring Beatrice. Margaret is critical of what Hero has chosen to wear but quickly backs off when Hero scolds her lightly. Margaret also teases Hero about Claudio and his soon-to-be presence in her bed. When Beatrice arrives, she says that she is not feeling well. Margaret teases her that she is sick with love. Ursula returns to tell them that the men have come to take Hero to the church.","The play's final scene begins with the friar's reminder to everyone -- Leonato, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, and Benedick -- that he never doubted Hero's innocence. Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. The ladies leave to cover their faces with veils. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio. As soon as Claudio vows publicly to marry this stranger, Hero reveals her identity to the amazement of Claudio and Don Pedro. Once again Claudio is overcome with love for Hero. Meanwhile, Benedick asks which of the veiled ladies is Beatrice and asks if she loves him. Their usual denials and quick repartee continue until Claudio and Hero each produces love poems Beatrice and Benedick have written to one another. Finally, they happily accept each other. At Benedick's suggestion, dancing begins even before the marriage ceremony. A messenger interrupts the festivities with the news that Don John has been taken prisoner and is being brought back to Messina. Benedick suggests that they think about Don John tomorrow, when Benedick will invent appropriate punishments for him.","On the morning of her wedding to Claudio, Hero wakes up early and tells her servant Ursula to wake Beatrice. Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice arrives, and Margaret, in high spirits, teases her about her changed personality, saying that now Beatrice too desires a husband. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church. They all set off together","Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music","The plot does not move much in this scene. Hero is dressing up for the wedding. Margaret seems innocent of the evil that the audience knows she has participated in, armed with a sharp wit and a friendly disposition. She says that Hero's heart will be heavier by the weight of a man-a veiled reference to marital union. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.","Claudio and Don Pedro call on Leonato and Antonio as per the agreement. All the ladies of the house are masked. Leonato presents one of them to Claudio as Antonio's daughter whom he shall marry. Claudio accepts her hand. When she takes off her mask, he is shocked to find that she is Hero herself. Don Pedro and Claudio are glad that Hero is not indeed dead, as they had been made to believe. Benedick now announces his decision to get married, of course, to Beatrice. The play ends with the news that Don John has been captured and all the characters proceed to dance.","It is the wedding day and Hero is busy with preparations for the event. Beatrice enters and seems to be out of spirits. Margaret and Beatrice playfully exchange taunts. Then, Margaret tells Beatrice that she doesn't know why Benedick is suddenly so forlorn and subdued.

Benedick then asks Leonato for permission to marry Beatrice at the same wedding ceremony. Leonato agrees to the marriage. Claudio and Don Pedro arrive and are greeted. The women then come out wearing masks to hide their identities. Claudio asks which lady he shall marry, and Antonio gives him Hero. She unmasks herself, causing Claudio to cry out, \"Another Hero. She replies, \"Nothing certainer\". At the wedding Benedick calls for Beatrice to reveal herself. She does, and he asks her if she loves him. Beatrice gives the surprisingly cold answer, \"Why no, no more than reason\". Benedick admits the same thing, and they both realize that they were set up by their friends. Watching this extraordinary exchange, Claudio and Hero pull out sonnets that Benedick and Beatrice wrote to each other and show them as proof that they really do love each other. Benedick states, \"A miracle. Here's our own hands against our hearts\". Benedick and Claudio reconcile their friendship and tell Don Pedro to find himself a wife so he is not alone. A messenger arrives at the very end and informs them that Don John has been captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick tells them, \"Think not on him till tomorrow, I'll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers\"","It's the morning of the wedding, and the scene is set in Hero's bedroom. Hero has sent Ursula off to go get Beatrice, and Margaret is helping Hero get dressed. They go back and forth fondly over what Hero should wear. Margaret describes the beautiful dress Hero will wear as full of gold, silver, and pearls, but Hero seems uncomfortable. Hero hopes the dress will bring her joy, because she says her heart is heavy. Instead of noting that Hero is clearly unhappy and has a weird feeling, Margaret makes a joke about the fact that soon, Hero's chest will be heavy under the weight of a husband. Hey-o! These people and their cheap sex jokes. Beatrice enters and, as usual, becomes the focus of attention. She says she doesn't feel well. When she sighs, Margaret asks her if she's sighing for a hawk, a horse, or a husband. She's hinting at Beatrice's new found love for Benedick, but Beatrice won't bite. She says she's sighing because of an \"H,\" a pun on \"ache.\" At one point Beatrice says she's stuffed, as in congested, but Margaret turns it into a dirty joke, and says, \"Stuffed? That's quite a way for a young, unmarried woman to catch a cold!\" Beatrice wonders when Margaret became so witty, but the last straw is when Margaret suggests Beatrice could be cured of her ailment by some holy thistle that just happens to be named carduus benedictus. Her hints are getting pretty obvious. Beatrice flips out. In response to Beatrice's tizzy, Margaret says she didn't mean anything special by using the name carduus benedictus. She just meant regular old thistle. And of course, she doesn't think Beatrice is in love. That would be ridiculous. Although... Benedick used to share Beatrice's views on the absurdity of love, but he's obviously all-in now. Margaret finishes by saying that she doesn't know how it happened, but it seems to her that Beatrice's views on love have changed, too. She suddenly seems to be looking at love the way other women do. Beatrice demands to know what Margaret is talking about, but she gets interrupted by Ursula, who informs them that everyone is ready to take Hero to the church--where she will be married.","At Leonato's house, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Friar Francis, and Hero are gathered and recounting all the recent developments. Everyone's glad that Hero is innocent. Don Pedro and Claudio are innocent too, since they were only misled. Further, Leonato says it came out in the court examination that that though Margaret played a role in the deception, she didn't know it, and is innocent of the crime too. Leonato's glad things turned out so well, and Benedick is glad that he won't have to kill or severely maim his friend Claudio after all. It's about time for Don Pedro and Claudio to arrive, and Leonato begins to instruct people on the roles they should play. The ladies should all go away and not come back until they're called. When they arrive, they should all have their faces masked in some way. Antonio will play his part by pretending the masked girl he'll present to Claudio for marriage is his daughter, when actually it's Hero! With the ladies out of the room, Benedick speaks with Leonato and Friar Francis. He says that Beatrice loves him , and the he loves Beatrice . Benedick doesn't quite understand what Leonato means, but he does say he'd like to be married to Beatrice today if possible. Leonato gives his blessing, and the Friar says he's happy to perform the service. Double wedding, everybody! Then Don Pedro, Claudio, and some others enter. Leonato asks if Claudio is still ready to marry Antonio's daughter, and Claudio graciously replies that he'll marry her even if she's an Ethiope Leonato sends Antonio off to get \"Antonio's daughter.\" Don Pedro and Claudio start heckling Benedick, who they think is looking out of sorts, likely over the marriage situation. Benedick doesn't reveal to them his intention to marry Beatrice just yet, instead he compares Claudio's mom to a cow. Before Claudio can call Benedick's mom a heifer, Antonio re-enters with all the masked ladies. Claudio would like to see his soon-to-be wife's face, but Leonato says he has to take her hand and accept her first. Claudio takes the mystery girl's hand and swears that he's her husband, if she'll have him. Hero whips off her mask, and Claudio is psyched to see \"another Hero.\" Hero says that the Hero who was slandered is dead, but this Hero--who is still an innocent maiden--lives. Prince Don Pedro then declares this is the former Hero, the one that's dead. Um...at least they're getting warmer. Leonato clarifies that Hero was \"dead\" only while her slander lived on. The Friar says he'll explain everything, but for now, they should just roll with it and get this marriage in the books. There's another hold up on the way to the chapel, as Benedick stops the Friar and asks which masked lady is Beatrice. Beatrice steps forth, and then she and Benedick engage in the most silly, passive aggressive exchanges ever to happen between two lovesick people. Benedick publicly asks Beatrice if she loves him, and she denies it --kind of. So Benedick also kind of denies it when she throws the same question back at him. Both seem a little taken aback, first by how publicly their word is being tested, but also by the fact that they each had \"inside information\" about the other's secret crush. They're about to shake hands and relegate each other to a life of being in simply the friend zone, but thankfully Hero and Claudio pipe up. Claudio shows off a little note he's stolen--it's a really bad poem in Benedick's handwriting, clearly meant for Beatrice. Hero is also a thief, as she's taken from her cousin Beatrice's pocket a similar note, declaring Beatrice's love for Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize their hands have revealed their hearts. Though they tease that they're only marrying each other out of pity, they finally just start making out . Prince Don Pedro again teases Benedick about getting married . Benedick says nobody can wreck his mood today, and he won't listen to any bad words about marriage--not even his own. Then he tells Claudio that he would have kicked his butt if they had ever dueled, but he'll let Claudio off the hook now that their related by marriage. Claudio jests that he hoped Benedick wouldn't marry Beatrice, as Claudio wanted to see Benedick become a married man and also a cheater. Then again, Benedick might end up being a cheater anyway...if Beatrice doesn't keep a close eye on him. Benedick calls for dancing, though Leonato thinks they really should have marriages before dancing. The old man is ignored, and Benedick calls for music. Then Benedick teases Don Pedro about needing to get a wife. Finally, randomly, a messenger comes in and announces that Don John was captured and brought back to Messina. Benedick counsels Don Pedro to not worry about this right now, and instead, to be merry, and everyone exits in a dance.","Early on the wedding morning, Hero and her gentlewomen are preparing Hero for her wedding. Hero sends Ursula to bring Beatrice. Margaret is critical of what Hero has chosen to wear but quickly backs off when Hero scolds her lightly. Margaret also teases Hero about Claudio and his soon-to-be presence in her bed. When Beatrice arrives, she says that she is not feeling well. Margaret teases her that she is sick with love. Ursula returns to tell them that the men have come to take Hero to the church.","The play's final scene begins with the friar's reminder to everyone -- Leonato, Margaret, Ursula, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, and Benedick -- that he never doubted Hero's innocence. Leonato excuses the actions of Claudio and Don Pedro and then reviews what is to happen next in the final deception they have planned. The ladies leave to cover their faces with veils. After confirming Leonato's approval, Benedick asks the friar to perform a marriage between himself and Beatrice. Claudio and Don Pedro appear, and Claudio prepares to marry \"Antonio's daughter,\" as he promised. The veiled women enter with Antonio. As soon as Claudio vows publicly to marry this stranger, Hero reveals her identity to the amazement of Claudio and Don Pedro. Once again Claudio is overcome with love for Hero. Meanwhile, Benedick asks which of the veiled ladies is Beatrice and asks if she loves him. Their usual denials and quick repartee continue until Claudio and Hero each produces love poems Beatrice and Benedick have written to one another. Finally, they happily accept each other. At Benedick's suggestion, dancing begins even before the marriage ceremony. A messenger interrupts the festivities with the news that Don John has been taken prisoner and is being brought back to Messina. Benedick suggests that they think about Don John tomorrow, when Benedick will invent appropriate punishments for him.","On the morning of her wedding to Claudio, Hero wakes up early and tells her servant Ursula to wake Beatrice. Meanwhile, Hero's maid Margaret argues affectionately with Hero about what she ought to wear for her wedding. Hero is excited, but she is also uneasy for reasons she cannot name; she has a strange foreboding of disaster. Beatrice arrives, and Margaret, in high spirits, teases her about her changed personality, saying that now Beatrice too desires a husband. Beatrice expresses annoyance, but Margaret is sure that she is right, and so she continues to tease Beatrice about Benedick--but in a manner subtle enough that Beatrice cannot accuse Margaret of knowing anything completely. Soon enough, Claudio arrives with his friends, accompanied by the large wedding party, apparently ready to take Hero to the church. They all set off together","Meanwhile, in the church, Leonato, Antonio, Beatrice, Benedick, Hero, Margaret, Ursula, and the friar prepare for the second wedding of Claudio and Hero. We learn from their conversation that Margaret has been interrogated, and that she is innocent of conspiring with Borachio and Don John--she never realized that she was taking part in Don John's treachery. Benedick is also very relieved that Don John's trick has come to light, for now he does not need to fight his friend Claudio. Quietly, Benedick also takes Leonato aside and asks him for his permission to marry Beatrice. Don Pedro and Claudio enter, and Antonio goes off to fetch the masked women. While they are waiting, Don Pedro and Claudio tease Benedick about his love for Beatrice and about the fact that he will soon be married, although they do not know that he actually does plan to be married that very day. Hero, Beatrice, and the waiting women enter, all wearing masks. Claudio vows to marry the masked woman by his side, whom he believes to be Leonato's mysterious niece. But when Hero takes off her mask, the shocked Claudio realizes that it really is Hero. Leonato and Hero tell him that now that Hero's name has been cleared, she can figuratively come back to life and be his wife, as she should have been before. The party prepares to go to the chapel to finish the ceremony, but Benedick stops everybody. He asks Beatrice, out loud and in public, whether she loves him. Beatrice denies it, and Benedick, in turn, denies loving her. They both agree that they are good friends, but not in love. But, laughingly, Claudio and Hero tell them that they know that isn't the truth--and both whip out scribbled, half-finished love poems that they have found in their friends' rooms and pockets, written from Benedick to Beatrice and from Beatrice to Benedick. Benedick and Beatrice realize that they have been caught red-handed and, giving in, finally agree to marry. Benedick silences Beatrice, for the first time, by kissing her. Claudio and Don Pedro begin to tease Benedick again, but Benedick laughingly says that he does not care--he remains determined to be married, and nothing he has ever said against marriage in the past makes any difference to him now. He and Claudio assert their friendship again, and Benedick calls for a dance before the double wedding. Suddenly, a messenger rushes in to inform the company that Leonato's men have arrested Don John in his flight from Mes-sina. They have brought him back to Messina a prisoner. Benedick instructs Don Pedro to put off thinking about the villain until tomorrow, when Benedick will invent fine tortures for him. In the meantime, Benedick insists that all must dance joyfully in celebrating the marriages, and he commands the pipers to strike up the music","The plot does not move much in this scene. Hero is dressing up for the wedding. Margaret seems innocent of the evil that the audience knows she has participated in, armed with a sharp wit and a friendly disposition. She says that Hero's heart will be heavier by the weight of a man-a veiled reference to marital union. She also teases Beatrice by pointing at the change in her, suggesting that she, too, needs to marry.","Claudio and Don Pedro call on Leonato and Antonio as per the agreement. All the ladies of the house are masked. Leonato presents one of them to Claudio as Antonio's daughter whom he shall marry. Claudio accepts her hand. When she takes off her mask, he is shocked to find that she is Hero herself. Don Pedro and Claudio are glad that Hero is not indeed dead, as they had been made to believe. Benedick now announces his decision to get married, of course, to Beatrice. The play ends with the news that Don John has been captured and all the characters proceed to dance.","It is the wedding day and Hero is busy with preparations for the event. Beatrice enters and seems to be out of spirits. Margaret and Beatrice playfully exchange taunts. Then, Margaret tells Beatrice that she doesn't know why Benedick is suddenly so forlorn and subdued. Much to Beatrice's horror, she wonders aloud if the two are in love.","The next day, Friar Francis is happy that his hunch about Hero's innocence is correct. Leonato asks all the women to withdraw into a chamber and return masked when they are called for. In the meantime, Benedick confesses his love for Beatrice to the friar and Leonato. Don Pedro and Claudio arrive at the church and are ready for the wedding. Antonio escorts the women outside and Claudio is confused at who is to be his future bride, since all the women are masked. Leonato tells Claudio that he cannot see his new bride's face until they have been married. After the ceremony, the bride takes off her mask, revealing that she is none other than Hero. Claudio is overcome with joy but is amazed that she is alive. Friar Francis promises to tell everyone about Hero's \"death\" later on. Since the mood in the church is so happy, Benedick asks Beatrice to proclaim her love for him. They both realize that Don Pedro and Hero tricked them into loving each other. Benedick and Beatrice are happily united and everyone is merry. A messenger informs the group that Don John has come back with armed men to Messina to fight his brother. Benedick tells everyone to dance and have fun and forget about Don John until tomorrow."],"next summary id":"act 3, scene 5","next chapter":"The watchmen Dogberry and Verges approach Leonato to try and tell him what treachery has happened.

Ben Weatherstaff enters the garden and Colin draws attention to himself, demanding to know from Ben if he sees him as a hunchback. Ben responds that he is not, and that everyone has been a fool to believe that Colin would die. Ben tells Colin about how the garden belonged to Mrs. Craven, his mother. Colin declares that now it is his and that it must be left a secret. Ben reveals that he has been in the secret garden before by climbing over the wall, which explains how the roses in the garden look pruned. As the sun goes down, Ben Weatherstaff presents Colin with a potted rose, which Colin plants in the soil himself. When Colin returns for the night, Dr. Craven warns him to minimize his time spent outside, and Colin responds defiantly that he will be going out every day and that he can't be stopped. Mary notices Colin's rude way of ordering around people and tells him directly that he could have better manners. Colin is surprised to hear that he behaves in this strange way, but he vows to keep visiting the garden, where he will be transformed by Magic. In the following months, many magical things take place in the garden as the flowers start budding. Colin continues to spend time there every day, watching things grow. Colin believes that it is the Magic that allowed him to stand for the first time in the garden. One day, Colin calls over Ben Weatherstaff, Mary, and Dickon to declare that when he grows up he will be a scientist who studies Magic. He proposes they do an experiment where every day they each affirm that Magic is inside of them and is making them well and to observe the results. They then sit cross-legged in a circle under the tree to start the experiment. Colin repeats a chant about how Magic lives through all of life, including in them. They then form a procession through the garden where Colin continues to declare that Magic is making him strong. He has made himself believe that he is not sick anymore and imagines what his father would think when he sees him well. The children continue to do these ceremonies regularly. Dickon starts working at another garden near his cottage. His mother, Mrs. Sowerby, enjoys going out to this garden and talking to the boy. There, Dickon divulges to her all the things that have been happening at Misselthwaite Manor and she becomes in on the secret. Mrs. Sowerby offers to prepare the children milk and bread to enjoy during their days in the garden, in order to help Colin and Mary fatten up. Dr. Craven and the nurses are beginning to notice Colin's increased appetite, so he can't ask for more food. He tries to not make himself seem too healthy, as he doesn't want anyone to find out about the secret garden and interfere with the children's daily routine. When the doctor proposes writing to Colin's father to tell him of his improving health, Colin panics and considers he might have to start eating less in order to discourage Dr. Craven. Mary and Colin find it difficult to eat less, however, because their appetites are growing each day. Thus they are delighted to receive the food from Mrs. Sowerby. Not wanting to put too much pressure on Dickon's mother to feed them, they also create a tiny oven in a hollow near the garden, in which the children cook potatoes and eggs. Becoming stronger, Colin is able to stand and walk more and more. The manor staff are perplexed at how the children can grow so strong and look so healthy while eating so little. The garden is blooming more and more and the robins are hatching eggs, which is described as a miracle. The robin's perspective is given, where he reveals that he trusts Dickon around the eggs but not necessarily Colin and Mary. The robins observe Colin learning to walk and conclude that the boy is learning to fly. On a rainy day, Mary and Colin amuse themselves by exploring the unused rooms in the mansion. Their playing causes them to have a great appetite and they both finish their lunches for the first time in awhile, much to the happiness of the staff. Later, Mary notices that Colin has removed the curtain from his mother's portrait in his room. Colin continues to lecture the children and Ben Weatherstaff about Magic, even while they are at work weeding in the garden. One day, Ben suggests Dickon sing the \\\"Doxology,\\\" a hymn which praises God and all His creatures. As the children sing the hymn, a woman with affectionate eyes and a long blue cloak enters. It is Dickon's mother. She is surprised and happy to see Colin so well. She is also shocked because of the uncanny resemblance Colin bears to his own mother. She also notices how much Mary has grown healthier. The children ask her if she believes in Magic, to which she says yes, calling it the \\\"Big Good Thing\\\" in which they must always put their faith. The last chapter starts with narration about how the power of thoughts will be discovered and better understood in the 20th century. For instance, a bad thought can negatively affect the body just as much as a disease. This is shown through the characters of Mary and Colin. The narrator speaks of Mr. Craven, who for 10 years has thought only negatively and has not had the courage to be more positive, even while traveling throughout beautiful places in Europe. One day, while sitting by a stream in Austria, he starts thinking of the site's beauty and he suddenly feels alive for the first time in years. He can't maintain this new hope all the time, but he feels over the next few days that his usual sense of burden periodically lifts. One night, Mr. Craven dreams of hearing Mrs. Craven's voice calling to him, telling him that she is in their special garden. The next day, he receives a letter from Mrs. Sowerby advising him to come home, and that Mrs. Craven would want him to come if she were alive. Mr. Craven makes the journey back, thinking of Colin in a way he hasn't in years. He reflects on how he has not been the best father to Colin, avoiding him because of his resemblance to his wife. As he arrives back at the manor, he thinks about how he will find the key to the secret garden. Mrs. Medlock updates Mr. Craven on Colin's new behaviors and habit of going outdoors every single day. Mr. Craven hurriedly goes to the secret garden. Outside its walls he is surprised to hear commotion and laughter of children. All of a sudden, Colin bursts out of the garden door and bumps directly into his father. Mr. Craven is astonished yet happy to see Colin standing, looking healthy and vibrant. Colin takes him into the garden and tells him everything: about the Magic, the creatures, and his new friends. Mr. Craven laughs and cries with joy at hearing his son's story. The manor servants are completely shocked when they see out the window a healthy-looking Colin and his father walking together towards the house.\", \"analysis\": \"In the last sections of The Secret Garden, author Frances Hodgson Burnett masterfully ties together the different aspects of the plot to create the ultimate happily-ever-after resolution. No character in this story is left unaccounted for, as evident in the way each one makes some sort of appearance and finds their own sense of peace after experiencing great challenges and struggles. For instance, when the groundskeeper Ben Weatherstaff catches the children in the garden, his initial dismay transforms into happy astonishment at seeing the once crippled Colin standing and playing like a normal child. Through witnessing this, Ben can at last feel a sort of closure after many years of tending to the garden in secret. In the final chapters, Ben ultimately finds himself participating alongside Mary, Dickon, and Colin in the care taking of the garden and the magical ceremonies they create. There is a great deal of symbolism in Colin's presence in the garden, especially at the moment he plants a rose, the favorite flower of his mother. In this act, we are shown how despite the tragic passing of Mrs. Craven, life always continues, even after what seems like a final death. Her continuation is both literally through her son and more metaphysically through the joy and hope of the children who are determined to nurture and revive a garden on the verge of decay. In this way, the spirit of Mrs. Craven is truly honored and kept alive, as those things she loved most are not forgotten. Finally, Colin is willing to remove the curtain that long covered his mother's portrait, as he is now able to see her happy expression not as a threat, but as an invitation to cultivate his own happiness. The importance of nature in maintaining health and happiness is a theme emphasized over and over again. When Colin finds the strength to stand for the first time in ages, it is attributed to the magic of the secret garden, and on a deeper level, the magic of life. While Colin was once resigned to the role of perpetually sick patient, being outside has awakened in him a recognition of his own innate power as a human being embedded in nature. This is demonstrated in his chanting about how Magic is within him and within all of life. In direct contact with sunlight and soil, no longer does he, nor Mary for that matter, feel a sense of separation between themselves and the world at large. The most significant moment of resolution occurs in the final chapter, when Archibald Craven returns to his manor to find the children in what he had believed was a locked up and neglected garden. The transformation of Mr. Craven occurs in a mystical way: first, while sitting by a river, he miraculously experiences a profound sense of peace that stands in stark contrast to his habitual malaise. Next, he dreams that his wife calls to him to come into the garden. Then, the following day he receives a letter from Mrs. Sowerby urging him to return home. It is as if life itself is guiding the grieving man out of his deadened state, to embrace the possibility that not all has failed; that his son is not actually dying, but increasingly healthy; that his wife is not forever gone but living on through her reborn garden. Stylistically, there are certain moments in the narrative when the usual, intimate third-person narration is interrupted with a more direct address to the reader, such as in the beginning of Chapter 27, or in Chapter 23. Here, the author seems to zoom out in her focus on Mary, Colin, and Dickon to instead discuss issues of belief and magic in a wider context. In this way, the reader is asked to contemplate these philosophical themes and make more powerful conclusions about why the characters behave in the way they do. For example, when we see that Mr. Craven has denied his own magical ability to heal from grief, we can better comprehend his neglectful mode of parenting or his tendency for seclusion. In this way, the reader is truly encouraged to hold compassion for all characters and recognize the possibility for anyone to transform into a better person.\"}","chapter":"\n\nWhen his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.\n\n\"Go and meet him,\" he said; and Mary flew across the grass to the door\nunder the ivy.\n\nDickon was watching him with sharp eyes.  There were scarlet spots on\nhis cheeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.\n\n\"I can stand,\" he said, and his head was still held up and he said it\nquite grandly.\n\n\"I told thee tha' could as soon as tha' stopped bein' afraid,\" answered\nDickon.  \"An' tha's stopped.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've stopped,\" said Colin.\n\nThen suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.\n\n\"Are you making Magic?\" he asked sharply.\n\nDickon's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.\n\n\"Tha's doin' Magic thysel',\" he said.  \"It's same Magic as made these\n'ere work out o' th' earth,\" and he touched with his thick boot a clump\nof crocuses in the grass.  Colin looked down at them.\n\n\"Aye,\" he said slowly, \"there couldna' be bigger Magic than that\nthere--there couldna' be.\"\n\nHe drew himself up straighter than ever.\n\n\"I'm going to walk to that tree,\" he said, pointing to one a few feet\naway from him.  \"I'm going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.\nI can rest against the tree if I like.  When I want to sit down I will\nsit down, but not before.  Bring a rug from the chair.\"\n\nHe walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully\nsteady.  When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that\nhe supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straight\nthat he looked tall.\n\nWhen Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him\nstanding there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.\n\n\"What art sayin'?\" he asked rather testily because he did not want his\nattention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud\nface.\n\nBut she did not tell him.  What she was saying was this:\n\n\"You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could!  You can do it!\nYou can do it! You can!\" She was saying it to Colin because she wanted\nto make Magic and keep him on his feet looking like that.  She could\nnot bear that he should give in before Ben Weatherstaff.  He did not\ngive in.  She was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite\nbeautiful in spite of his thinness.  He fixed his eyes on Ben\nWeatherstaff in his funny imperious way.\n\n\"Look at me!\" he commanded.  \"Look at me all over! Am I a hunchback?\nHave I got crooked legs?\"\n\nBen Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he had\nrecovered a little and answered almost in his usual way.\n\n\"Not tha',\" he said.  \"Nowt o' th' sort.  What's tha' been doin' with\nthysel'--hidin' out o' sight an' lettin' folk think tha' was cripple\nan' half-witted?\"\n\n\"Half-witted!\" said Colin angrily.  \"Who thought that?\"\n\n\"Lots o' fools,\" said Ben.  \"Th' world's full o' jackasses brayin' an'\nthey never bray nowt but lies.  What did tha' shut thysel' up for?\"\n\n\"Everyone thought I was going to die,\" said Colin shortly.  \"I'm not!\"\n\nAnd he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up\nand down, down and up.\n\n\"Tha' die!\" he said with dry exultation.  \"Nowt o' th' sort! Tha's got\ntoo much pluck in thee.  When I seed thee put tha' legs on th' ground\nin such a hurry I knowed tha' was all right.  Sit thee down on th' rug\na bit young Mester an' give me thy orders.\"\n\nThere was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd\nunderstanding in his manner.  Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as\nshe could as they had come down the Long Walk.  The chief thing to be\nremembered, she had told him, was that Colin was getting well--getting\nwell.  The garden was doing it.  No one must let him remember about\nhaving humps and dying.\n\nThe Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.\n\n\"What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Anythin' I'm told to do,\" answered old Ben.  \"I'm kep' on by\nfavor--because she liked me.\"\n\n\"She?\" said Colin.\n\n\"Tha' mother,\" answered Ben Weatherstaff.\n\n\"My mother?\" said Colin, and he looked about him quietly.  \"This was\nher garden, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Aye, it was that!\" and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too.  \"She\nwere main fond of it.\"\n\n\"It is my garden now.  I am fond of it.  I shall come here every day,\"\nannounced Colin.  \"But it is to be a secret.  My orders are that no one\nis to know that we come here.  Dickon and my cousin have worked and\nmade it come alive.  I shall send for you sometimes to help--but you\nmust come when no one can see you.\"\n\nBen Weatherstaff's face twisted itself in a dry old smile.\n\n\"I've come here before when no one saw me,\" he said.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Colin.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Th' last time I was here,\" rubbing his chin and looking round, \"was\nabout two year' ago.\"\n\n\"But no one has been in it for ten years!\" cried Colin.\n\n\"There was no door!\"\n\n\"I'm no one,\" said old Ben dryly.  \"An' I didn't come through th' door.\nI come over th' wall.  Th' rheumatics held me back th' last two year'.\"\n\n\"Tha' come an' did a bit o' prunin'!\" cried Dickon.  \"I couldn't make\nout how it had been done.\"\n\n\"She was so fond of it--she was!\" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly.  \"An'\nshe was such a pretty young thing.  She says to me once, 'Ben,' says\nshe laughin', 'if ever I'm ill or if I go away you must take care of my\nroses.' When she did go away th' orders was no one was ever to come\nnigh.  But I come,\" with grumpy obstinacy.  \"Over th' wall I\ncome--until th' rheumatics stopped me--an' I did a bit o' work once a\nyear.  She'd gave her order first.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't have been as wick as it is if tha' hadn't done it,\" said\nDickon.  \"I did wonder.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you did it, Weatherstaff,\" said Colin.  \"You'll know how to\nkeep the secret.\"\n\n\"Aye, I'll know, sir,\" answered Ben.  \"An' it'll be easier for a man\nwi' rheumatics to come in at th' door.\"\n\nOn the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel.  Colin\nstretched out his hand and took it up.  An odd expression came into his\nface and he began to scratch at the earth.  His thin hand was weak\nenough but presently as they watched him--Mary with quite breathless\ninterest--he drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some\nover.\n\n\"You can do it! You can do it!\" said Mary to herself.  \"I tell you, you\ncan!\"\n\nDickon's round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not a\nword.  Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.\n\nColin persevered.  After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he\nspoke exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.\n\n\"Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same as other folk--an'\ntha' said tha'd have me diggin'. I thowt tha' was just leein' to please\nme.  This is only th' first day an' I've walked--an' here I am diggin'.\"\n\nBen Weatherstaff's mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he\nended by chuckling.\n\n\"Eh!\" he said, \"that sounds as if tha'd got wits enow.  Tha'rt a\nYorkshire lad for sure.  An' tha'rt diggin', too.  How'd tha' like to\nplant a bit o' somethin'? I can get thee a rose in a pot.\"\n\n\"Go and get it!\" said Colin, digging excitedly.  \"Quick! Quick!\"\n\nIt was done quickly enough indeed.  Ben Weatherstaff went his way\nforgetting rheumatics.  Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper\nand wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it.  Mary\nslipped out to run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon had\ndeepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over.\nHe looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new\nexercise, slight as it was.\n\n\"I want to do it before the sun goes quite--quite down,\" he said.\n\nMary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on\npurpose.  Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the\ngreenhouse.  He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could.  He had\nbegun to be excited, too.  He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot\nfrom the mould.\n\n\"Here, lad,\" he said, handing the plant to Colin.  \"Set it in the earth\nthysel' same as th' king does when he goes to a new place.\"\n\nThe thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush grew deeper as he\nset the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the\nearth.  It was filled in and pressed down and made steady.  Mary was\nleaning forward on her hands and knees.  Soot had flown down and\nmarched forward to see what was being done.  Nut and Shell chattered\nabout it from a cherry-tree.\n\n\"It's planted!\" said Colin at last.  \"And the sun is only slipping over\nthe edge.  Help me up, Dickon.  I want to be standing when it goes.\nThat's part of the Magic.\"\n\nAnd Dickon helped him, and the Magic--or whatever it was--so gave him\nstrength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange\nlovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his two\nfeet--laughing.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned\nto it.  He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send\nsome one out to explore the garden paths.  When Colin was brought back\nto his room the poor man looked him over seriously.\n\n\"You should not have stayed so long,\" he said.  \"You must not overexert\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I am not tired at all,\" said Colin.  \"It has made me well.  Tomorrow I\nam going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"I am not sure that I can allow it,\" answered Dr. Craven.  \"I am afraid\nit would not be wise.\"\n\n\"It would not be wise to try to stop me,\" said Colin quite seriously.\n\"I am going.\"\n\nEven Mary had found out that one of Colin's chief peculiarities was\nthat he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with\nhis way of ordering people about.  He had lived on a sort of desert\nisland all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his\nown manners and had had no one to compare himself with.  Mary had\nindeed been rather like him herself and since she had been at\nMisselthwaite had gradually discovered that her own manners had not\nbeen of the kind which is usual or popular.  Having made this discovery\nshe naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin.\nSo she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes after Dr.\nCraven had gone.  She wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it\nand of course she did.\n\n\"What are you looking at me for?\" he said.\n\n\"I'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some\nsatisfaction.  \"He won't get Misselthwaite at all now I'm not going to\ndie.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for him because of that, of course,\" said Mary, \"but I was\nthinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be\npolite for ten years to a boy who was always rude.  I would never have\ndone it.\"\n\n\"Am I rude?\" Colin inquired undisturbedly.\n\n\"If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,\"\nsaid Mary, \"he would have slapped you.\"\n\n\"But he daren't,\" said Colin.\n\n\"No, he daren't,\" answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite\nwithout prejudice.  \"Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn't\nlike--because you were going to die and things like that.  You were\nsuch a poor thing.\"\n\n\"But,\" announced Colin stubbornly, \"I am not going to be a poor thing.\nI won't let people think I'm one.  I stood on my feet this afternoon.\"\n\n\"It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,\" Mary\nwent on, thinking aloud.\n\nColin turned his head, frowning.\n\n\"Am I queer?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mary, \"very. But you needn't be cross,\" she added\nimpartially, \"because so am I queer--and so is Ben Weatherstaff.  But I\nam not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I\nfound the garden.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be queer,\" said Colin.  \"I am not going to be,\" and he\nfrowned again with determination.\n\nHe was a very proud boy.  He lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw\nhis beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.\n\n\"I shall stop being queer,\" he said, \"if I go every day to the garden.\nThere is Magic in there--good Magic, you know, Mary.  I am sure there\nis.\" \"So am I,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Even if it isn't real Magic,\" Colin said, \"we can pretend it is.\nSomething is there--something!\"\n\n\"It's Magic,\" said Mary, \"but not black.  It's as white as snow.\"\n\nThey always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months\nthat followed--the wonderful months--the radiant months--the amazing\nones.  Oh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have never\nhad a garden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you\nwill know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to\npass there.  At first it seemed that green things would never cease\npushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in\nthe crevices of the walls.  Then the green things began to show buds\nand the buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every\nshade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson.  In its happy days\nflowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner.  Ben\nWeatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from\nbetween the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely\nclinging things to grow on.  Iris and white lilies rose out of the\ngrass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing\narmies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or\ncolumbines or campanulas.\n\n\"She was main fond o' them--she was,\" Ben Weatherstaff said.  \"She\nliked them things as was allus pointin' up to th' blue sky, she used to\ntell.  Not as she was one o' them as looked down on th' earth--not her.\nShe just loved it but she said as th' blue sky allus looked so joyful.\"\n\nThe seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended\nthem.  Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score,\ngaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which\nit might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had\ngot there.  And the roses--the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangled\nround the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their\nbranches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long\ngarlands falling in cascades--they came alive day by day, hour by hour.\nFair fresh leaves, and buds--and buds--tiny at first but swelling and\nworking Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent\ndelicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden\nair.\n\nColin saw it all, watching each change as it took place.  Every morning\nhe was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn't rain he\nspent in the garden.  Even gray days pleased him.  He would lie on the\ngrass \"watching things growing,\" he said.  If you watched long enough,\nhe declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves.  Also you could\nmake the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on\nvarious unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny\nscraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if\nthey were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the\ncountry.  A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and\nmaking its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so\nlike elfish hands, had absorbed him one whole morning.  Ants' ways,\nbeetles' ways, bees' ways, frogs' ways, birds' ways, plants' ways, gave\nhim a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added\nfoxes' ways, otters' ways, ferrets' ways, squirrels' ways, and trout'\nand water-rats' and badgers' ways, there was no end to the things to\ntalk about and think over.\n\nAnd this was not the half of the Magic.  The fact that he had really\nonce stood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when\nMary told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved\nof it greatly.  He talked of it constantly.\n\n\"Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,\" he said wisely\none day, \"but people don't know what it is like or how to make it.\nPerhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen\nuntil you make them happen.  I am going to try and experiment.\"\n\nThe next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once\nfor Ben Weatherstaff.  Ben came as quickly as he could and found the\nRajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also\nvery beautifully smiling.\n\n\"Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,\" he said.  \"I want you and Dickon and\nMiss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell\nyou something very important.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead.\n(One of the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his\nboyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages.  So he could\nreply like a sailor.)\n\n\"I am going to try a scientific experiment,\" explained the Rajah.\n\"When I grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I\nam going to begin now with this experiment.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the\nfirst time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.\n\nIt was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this\nstage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read\nabout a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing\nsort of boy.  When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on\nyou it seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though\nhe was only ten years old--going on eleven.  At this moment he was\nespecially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of\nactually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.\n\n\"The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,\" he went on,\n\"will be about Magic.  Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one\nknows anything about it except a few people in old books--and Mary a\nlittle, because she was born in India where there are fakirs.  I\nbelieve Dickon knows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn't know he knows\nit.  He charms animals and people.  I would never have let him come to\nsee me if he had not been an animal charmer--which is a boy charmer,\ntoo, because a boy is an animal.  I am sure there is Magic in\neverything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it\ndo things for us--like electricity and horses and steam.\"\n\nThis sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and\nreally could not keep still.  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" he said and he began to\nstand up quite straight.\n\n\"When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,\" the orator\nproceeded.  \"Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and\nmaking things out of nothing.  One day things weren't there and another\nthey were.  I had never watched things before and it made me feel very\ncurious.  Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be\nscientific.  I keep saying to myself, 'What is it? What is it?' It's\nsomething.  It can't be nothing! I don't know its name so I call it\nMagic.  I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and\nfrom what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too.  Something pushes\nit up and draws it.  Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've\nlooked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling\nof being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and\nmaking me breathe fast.  Magic is always pushing and drawing and making\nthings out of nothing.  Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and\ntrees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people.\nSo it must be all around us.  In this garden--in all the places.  The\nMagic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live\nto be a man.  I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to\nget some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me\nstrong.  I don't know how to do it but I think that if you keep\nthinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come.  Perhaps that is\nthe first baby way to get it.  When I was going to try to stand that\nfirst time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she could, 'You can\ndo it! You can do it!' and I did.  I had to try myself at the same\ntime, of course, but her Magic helped me--and so did Dickon's. Every\nmorning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can remember I am\ngoing to say, 'Magic is in me! Magic is making me well! I am going to\nbe as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!' And you must all do it,\ntoo.  That is my experiment Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said Ben Weatherstaff.  \"Aye, aye!\"\n\n\"If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through\ndrill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment\nsucceeds.  You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking\nabout them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be\nthe same with Magic.  If you keep calling it to come to you and help\nyou it will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.\" \"I\nonce heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs\nwho said words over and over thousands of times,\" said Mary.\n\n\"I've heard Jem Fettleworth's wife say th' same thing over thousands o'\ntimes--callin' Jem a drunken brute,\" said Ben Weatherstaff dryly.\n\"Summat allus come o' that, sure enough.  He gave her a good hidin' an'\nwent to th' Blue Lion an' got as drunk as a lord.\"\n\nColin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes.  Then he\ncheered up.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you see something did come of it.  She used the wrong\nMagic until she made him beat her.  If she'd used the right Magic and\nhad said something nice perhaps he wouldn't have got as drunk as a lord\nand perhaps--perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.\"\n\nBen Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his little\nold eyes.\n\n\"Tha'rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,\"\nhe said.  \"Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I'll give her a bit of a\nhint o' what Magic will do for her.  She'd be rare an' pleased if th'\nsinetifik 'speriment worked--an' so 'ud Jem.\"\n\nDickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining with\ncurious delight.  Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held a\nlong-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly\nwhile it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.\n\n\"Do you think the experiment will work?\" Colin asked him, wondering\nwhat he was thinking.  He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking\nwhen he saw him looking at him or at one of his \"creatures\" with his\nhappy wide smile.\n\nHe smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.\n\n\"Aye,\" he answered, \"that I do.  It'll work same as th' seeds do when\nth' sun shines on 'em. It'll work for sure.  Shall us begin it now?\"\n\nColin was delighted and so was Mary.  Fired by recollections of fakirs\nand devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit\ncross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.\n\n\"It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,\" said Colin.  \"I'm rather\ntired and I want to sit down.\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said Dickon, \"tha' mustn't begin by sayin' tha'rt tired.  Tha'\nmight spoil th' Magic.\"\n\nColin turned and looked at him--into his innocent round eyes.\n\n\"That's true,\" he said slowly.  \"I must only think of the Magic.\" It\nall seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their\ncircle.  Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led into\nappearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in being\nwhat he called \"agen' prayer-meetin's\" but this being the Rajah's\naffair he did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at\nbeing called upon to assist.  Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured.\nDickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer's\nsignal no one heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest,\nthe crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made\npart of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their\nown desire.\n\n\"The 'creatures' have come,\" said Colin gravely.  \"They want to help\nus.\"\n\nColin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought.  He held his head\nhigh as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a\nwonderful look in them.  The light shone on him through the tree canopy.\n\n\"Now we will begin,\" he said.  \"Shall we sway backward and forward,\nMary, as if we were dervishes?\"\n\n\"I canna' do no swayin' back'ard and for'ard,\" said Ben Weatherstaff.\n\"I've got th' rheumatics.\"\n\n\"The Magic will take them away,\" said Colin in a High Priest tone, \"but\nwe won't sway until it has done it.  We will only chant.\"\n\n\"I canna' do no chantin'\" said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily.\n\"They turned me out o' th' church choir th' only time I ever tried it.\"\n\nNo one smiled.  They were all too much in earnest.  Colin's face was\nnot even crossed by a shadow.  He was thinking only of the Magic.\n\n\"Then I will chant,\" he said.  And he began, looking like a strange boy\nspirit.  \"The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the Magic.\nThe flowers are growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the Magic.\nBeing alive is the Magic--being strong is the Magic.  The Magic is in\nme--the Magic is in me.  It is in me--it is in me.  It's in every one\nof us.  It's in Ben Weatherstaff's back.  Magic! Magic! Come and help!\"\n\nHe said it a great many times--not a thousand times but quite a goodly\nnumber.  Mary listened entranced.  She felt as if it were at once queer\nand beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on.  Ben Weatherstaff\nbegan to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable.\nThe humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice\nand drowsily melted into a doze.  Dickon sat cross-legged with his\nrabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back.  Soot\nhad pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder,\nthe gray film dropped over his eyes.  At last Colin stopped.\n\n\"Now I am going to walk round the garden,\" he announced.\n\nBen Weatherstaff's head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with\na jerk.\n\n\"You have been asleep,\" said Colin.\n\n\"Nowt o' th' sort,\" mumbled Ben.  \"Th' sermon was good enow--but I'm\nbound to get out afore th' collection.\"\n\nHe was not quite awake yet.\n\n\"You're not in church,\" said Colin.\n\n\"Not me,\" said Ben, straightening himself.  \"Who said I were? I heard\nevery bit of it.  You said th' Magic was in my back.  Th' doctor calls\nit rheumatics.\"\n\nThe Rajah waved his hand.\n\n\"That was the wrong Magic,\" he said.  \"You will get better.  You have\nmy permission to go to your work.  But come back tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see thee walk round the garden,\" grunted Ben.\n\nIt was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt.  In fact, being a\nstubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made up\nhis mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look\nover the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were\nany stumbling.\n\nThe Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was\nformed.  It really did look like a procession.  Colin was at its head\nwith Dickon on one side and Mary on the other.  Ben Weatherstaff walked\nbehind, and the \"creatures\" trailed after them, the lamb and the fox\ncub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping\nto nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt\nhimself in charge.\n\nIt was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity.  Every few\nyards it stopped to rest.  Colin leaned on Dickon's arm and privately\nBen Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his\nhand from its support and walked a few steps alone.  His head was held\nup all the time and he looked very grand.\n\n\"The Magic is in me!\" he kept saying.  \"The Magic is making me strong!\nI can feel it! I can feel it!\"\n\nIt seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him.\nHe sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on\nthe grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon,\nbut he would not give up until he had gone all round the garden.  When\nhe returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked\ntriumphant.\n\n\"I did it! The Magic worked!\" he cried.  \"That is my first scientific\ndiscovery.\".\n\n\"What will Dr. Craven say?\" broke out Mary.\n\n\"He won't say anything,\" Colin answered, \"because he will not be told.\nThis is to be the biggest secret of all.  No one is to know anything\nabout it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any\nother boy.  I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be\ntaken back in it.  I won't have people whispering and asking questions\nand I won't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite\nsucceeded.  Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall\njust walk into his study and say 'Here I am; I am like any other boy.\nI am quite well and I shall live to be a man.  It has been done by a\nscientific experiment.'\"\n\n\"He will think he is in a dream,\" cried Mary.  \"He won't believe his\neyes.\"\n\nColin flushed triumphantly.  He had made himself believe that he was\ngoing to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he\nhad been aware of it.  And the thought which stimulated him more than\nany other was this imagining what his father would look like when he\nsaw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers'\nsons.  One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days\nhad been his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was\nafraid to look at him.\n\n\"He'll be obliged to believe them,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I\nbegin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.\"\n\n\"We shall have thee takin' to boxin' in a week or so,\" said Ben\nWeatherstaff.  \"Tha'lt end wi' winnin' th' Belt an' bein' champion\nprize-fighter of all England.\"\n\nColin fixed his eyes on him sternly.\n\n\"Weatherstaff,\" he said, \"that is disrespectful.  You must not take\nliberties because you are in the secret.  However much the Magic works\nI shall not be a prize-fighter.  I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.\"\n\n\"Ax pardon--ax pardon, sir\" answered Ben, touching his forehead in\nsalute.  \"I ought to have seed it wasn't a jokin' matter,\" but his eyes\ntwinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased.  He really did not mind\nbeing snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining\nstrength and spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in.  Round the\ncottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall\nof rough stones.  Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight\nand on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there\nplanting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and\nherbs for his mother.  In the company of his \"creatures\" he did wonders\nthere and was never tired of doing them, it seemed.  While he dug or\nweeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to\nSoot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.\n\n\"We'd never get on as comfortable as we do,\" Mrs. Sowerby said, \"if it\nwasn't for Dickon's garden.  Anything'll grow for him.  His 'taters and\ncabbages is twice th' size of any one else's an' they've got a flavor\nwith 'em as nobody's has.\"\n\nWhen she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him.\nAfter supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that\nwas her quiet time.  She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on\nand hear stories of the day.  She loved this time.  There were not only\nvegetables in this garden.  Dickon had bought penny packages of flower\nseeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among\ngooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette\nand pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after\nyear or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into\nfine clumps.  The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire\nbecause he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and\nhedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses\nof the stones were to be seen.\n\n\"All a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive, mother,\" he would say, \"is\nto be friends with 'em for sure.  They're just like th' 'creatures.' If\nthey're thirsty give 'em drink and if they're hungry give 'em a bit o'\nfood.  They want to live same as we do.  If they died I should feel as\nif I'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.\"\n\nIt was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that\nhappened at Misselthwaite Manor.  At first she was only told that\n\"Mester Colin\" had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with\nMiss Mary and that it was doing him good.  But it was not long before\nit was agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might \"come\ninto the secret.\" Somehow it was not doubted that she was \"safe for\nsure.\"\n\nSo one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all\nthe thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze\nwhich had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned\nnever to reveal.  The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him,\nthe doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to\nthe hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's\nangry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant\nstrength, made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color\nseveral times.\n\n\"My word!\" she said.  \"It was a good thing that little lass came to th'\nManor.  It's been th' makin' o' her an' th' savin, o' him.  Standin' on\nhis feet! An' us all thinkin' he was a poor half-witted lad with not a\nstraight bone in him.\"\n\nShe asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep\nthinking.\n\n\"What do they make of it at th' Manor--him being so well an' cheerful\nan' never complainin'?\" she inquired.  \"They don't know what to make of\nit,\" answered Dickon.  \"Every day as comes round his face looks\ndifferent.  It's fillin' out and doesn't look so sharp an' th' waxy\ncolor is goin'.  But he has to do his bit o' complainin',\" with a\nhighly entertained grin.\n\n\"What for, i' Mercy's name?\" asked Mrs. Sowerby.\n\nDickon chuckled.\n\n\"He does it to keep them from guessin' what's happened.  If the doctor\nknew he'd found out he could stand on his feet he'd likely write and\ntell Mester Craven.  Mester Colin's savin' th' secret to tell himself.\nHe's goin' to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his father\ncomes back an' then he's goin' to march into his room an' show him he's\nas straight as other lads.  But him an' Miss Mary thinks it's best plan\nto do a bit o' groanin' an' frettin' now an' then to throw folk off th'\nscent.\"\n\nMrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had\nfinished his last sentence.\n\n\"Eh!\" she said, \"that pair's enjoyin' their-selves I'll warrant.\nThey'll get a good bit o' actin' out of it an' there's nothin' children\nlikes as much as play actin'. Let's hear what they do, Dickon lad.\"\nDickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her.  His eyes\nwere twinkling with fun.\n\n\"Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,\" he\nexplained.  \"An' he flies out at John, th' footman, for not carryin'\nhim careful enough.  He makes himself as helpless lookin' as he can an'\nnever lifts his head until we're out o' sight o' th' house.  An' he\ngrunts an' frets a good bit when he's bein' settled into his chair.\nHim an' Miss Mary's both got to enjoyin' it an' when he groans an'\ncomplains she'll say, 'Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so\nweak as that, poor Colin?'--but th' trouble is that sometimes they can\nscarce keep from burstin' out laughin'. When we get safe into the\ngarden they laugh till they've no breath left to laugh with.  An' they\nhave to stuff their faces into Mester Colin's cushions to keep the\ngardeners from hearin', if any of, 'em's about.\"\n\n\"Th' more they laugh th' better for 'em!\" said Mrs. Sowerby, still\nlaughing herself.  \"Good healthy child laughin's better than pills any\nday o' th' year.  That pair'll plump up for sure.\"\n\n\"They are plumpin' up,\" said Dickon.  \"They're that hungry they don't\nknow how to get enough to eat without makin' talk.  Mester Colin says\nif he keeps sendin' for more food they won't believe he's an invalid at\nall.  Miss Mary says she'll let him eat her share, but he says that if\nshe goes hungry she'll get thin an' they mun both get fat at once.\"\n\nMrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty\nthat she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and\nDickon laughed with her.\n\n\"I'll tell thee what, lad,\" Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak.\n\"I've thought of a way to help 'em. When tha' goes to 'em in th'\nmornin's tha' shall take a pail o' good new milk an' I'll bake 'em a\ncrusty cottage loaf or some buns wi' currants in 'em, same as you\nchildren like.  Nothin's so good as fresh milk an' bread.  Then they\ncould take off th' edge o' their hunger while they were in their garden\nan' th, fine food they get indoors 'ud polish off th' corners.\"\n\n\"Eh! mother!\" said Dickon admiringly, \"what a wonder tha' art! Tha'\nalways sees a way out o' things.  They was quite in a pother yesterday.\nThey didn't see how they was to manage without orderin' up more\nfood--they felt that empty inside.\"\n\n\"They're two young 'uns growin' fast, an' health's comin' back to both\nof 'em. Children like that feels like young wolves an' food's flesh an'\nblood to 'em,\" said Mrs. Sowerby.  Then she smiled Dickon's own curving\nsmile.  \"Eh! but they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure,\" she said.\n\nShe was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature--and she\nhad never been more so than when she said their \"play actin'\" would be\ntheir joy.  Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources\nof entertainment.  The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had\nbeen unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and\nthen by Dr. Craven himself.\n\n\"Your appetite.  Is improving very much, Master Colin,\" the nurse had\nsaid one day.  \"You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Nothing disagrees with me now\" replied Colin, and then seeing the\nnurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he\nought not to appear too well just yet.  \"At least things don't so often\ndisagree with me.  It's the fresh air.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is,\" said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystified\nexpression.  \"But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.\"\n\n\"How she stared at you!\" said Mary when she went away.  \"As if she\nthought there must be something to find out.\"\n\n\"I won't have her finding out things,\" said Colin.  \"No one must begin\nto find out yet.\" When Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled,\nalso.  He asked a number of questions, to Colin's great annoyance.\n\n\"You stay out in the garden a great deal,\" he suggested.  \"Where do you\ngo?\"\n\nColin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.\n\n\"I will not let any one know where I go,\" he answered.  \"I go to a\nplace I like.  Every one has orders to keep out of the way.  I won't be\nwatched and stared at.  You know that!\"\n\n\"You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm--I\ndo not think so.  The nurse says that you eat much more than you have\never done before.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, \"perhaps it is\nan unnatural appetite.\"\n\n\"I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,\" said Dr.\nCraven.  \"You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--perhaps I am bloated and feverish,\" said Colin, assuming a\ndiscouraging air of gloom.  \"People who are not going to live are\noften--different.\" Dr. Craven shook his head.  He was holding Colin's\nwrist and he pushed up his sleeve and felt his arm.\n\n\"You are not feverish,\" he said thoughtfully, \"and such flesh as you\nhave gained is healthy.  If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not\ntalk of dying.  Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable\nimprovement.\"\n\n\"I won't have him told!\" Colin broke forth fiercely.  \"It will only\ndisappoint him if I get worse again--and I may get worse this very\nnight.  I might have a raging fever.  I feel as if I might be beginning\nto have one now.  I won't have letters written to my father--I won't--I\nwon't!  You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me.  I\nfeel hot already.  I hate being written about and being talked over as\nmuch as I hate being stared at!\"\n\n\"Hush-h! my boy,\" Dr. Craven soothed him.  \"Nothing shall be written\nwithout your permission.  You are too sensitive about things.  You must\nnot undo the good which has been done.\"\n\nHe said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse\nhe privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned\nto the patient.\n\n\"The boy is extraordinarily better,\" he said.  \"His advance seems\nalmost abnormal.  But of course he is doing now of his own free will\nwhat we could not make him do before.  Still, he excites himself very\neasily and nothing must be said to irritate him.\" Mary and Colin were\nmuch alarmed and talked together anxiously.  From this time dated their\nplan of \"play actin'.\"\n\n\"I may be obliged to have a tantrum,\" said Colin regretfully.  \"I don't\nwant to have one and I'm not miserable enough now to work myself into a\nbig one.  Perhaps I couldn't have one at all.  That lump doesn't come\nin my throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible\nones.  But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do\nsomething.\"\n\nHe made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible\nto carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an\namazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast\nof home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and\nclotted cream.  Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found\nthemselves at the table--particularly if there were delicate slices of\nsizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver\ncover--they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.\n\n\"I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,\" Colin always\nended by saying.  \"We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal\nof the dinner.\"\n\nBut they never found they could send away anything and the highly\npolished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened\nmuch comment.\n\n\"I do wish,\" Colin would say also, \"I do wish the slices of ham were\nthicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.\"\n\n\"It's enough for a person who is going to die,\" answered Mary when\nfirst she heard this, \"but it's not enough for a person who is going to\nlive.  I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh\nheather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open\nwindow.\"\n\nThe morning that Dickon--after they had been enjoying themselves in the\ngarden for about two hours--went behind a big rosebush and brought\nforth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk\nwith cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made\ncurrant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully\ntucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised\njoyfulness.  What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What\na kind, clever woman she must be! How good the buns were! And what\ndelicious fresh milk!\n\n\"Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,\" said Colin.  \"It makes her\nthink of ways to do things--nice things.  She is a Magic person.  Tell\nher we are grateful, Dickon--extremely grateful.\" He was given to using\nrather grown-up phrases at times.  He enjoyed them.  He liked this so\nmuch that he improved upon it.\n\n\"Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.\"\n\nAnd then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with\nbuns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner\nof any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and\nbreathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours\nbehind him.\n\nThis was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.\nThey actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen\npeople to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two\nextra appetites every day.  So they asked her to let them send some of\ntheir shillings to buy things.\n\nDickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park\noutside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild\ncreatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort\nof tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it.  Roasted\neggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt\nand fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king--besides being\ndeliciously satisfying.  You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat\nas many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of\nthe mouths of fourteen people.\n\nEvery beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under\nthe plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after\nits brief blossom-time was ended.  After the ceremony Colin always took\nhis walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly\nfound power at intervals.  Each day he grew stronger and could walk\nmore steadily and cover more ground.  And each day his belief in the\nMagic grew stronger--as well it might.  He tried one experiment after\nanother as he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who\nshowed him the best things of all.\n\n\"Yesterday,\" he said one morning after an absence, \"I went to Thwaite\nfor mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth.  He's the\nstrongest chap on th' moor.  He's the champion wrestler an' he can jump\nhigher than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther.  He's gone all\nth' way to Scotland for th' sports some years.  He's knowed me ever\nsince I was a little 'un an' he's a friendly sort an' I axed him some\nquestions.  Th' gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o' thee,\nMester Colin, and I says, 'How did tha' make tha' muscles stick out\nthat way, Bob? Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?'\nAn' he says 'Well, yes, lad, I did.  A strong man in a show that came\nto Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every\nmuscle in my body.  An' I says, 'Could a delicate chap make himself\nstronger with 'em, Bob?' an' he laughed an' says, 'Art tha' th'\ndelicate chap?' an' I says, 'No, but I knows a young gentleman that's\ngettin' well of a long illness an' I wish I knowed some o' them tricks\nto tell him about.' I didn't say no names an' he didn't ask none.  He's\nfriendly same as I said an' he stood up an' showed me good-natured\nlike, an' I imitated what he did till I knowed it by heart.\"\n\nColin had been listening excitedly.\n\n\"Can you show me?\" he cried.  \"Will you?\"\n\n\"Aye, to be sure,\" Dickon answered, getting up.  \"But he says tha' mun\ndo 'em gentle at first an' be careful not to tire thysel'. Rest in\nbetween times an' take deep breaths an' don't overdo.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful,\" said Colin.  \"Show me! Show me! Dickon, you are the\nmost Magic boy in the world!\"\n\nDickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully\npractical but simple series of muscle exercises.  Colin watched them\nwith widening eyes.  He could do a few while he was sitting down.\nPresently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied\nfeet.  Mary began to do them also.  Soot, who was watching the\nperformance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about\nrestlessly because he could not do them too.\n\nFrom that time the exercises were part of the day's duties as much as\nthe Magic was.  It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more\nof them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that\nbut for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he\narrived they would have been lost.  But the little oven in the hollow\nand Mrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and\nthe nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again.  You can trifle with\nyour breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the\nbrim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and\noatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.\n\n\"They are eating next to nothing,\" said the nurse.  \"They'll die of\nstarvation if they can't be persuaded to take some nourishment.  And\nyet see how they look.\"\n\n\"Look!\" exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly.  \"Eh! I'm moithered to\ndeath with them.  They're a pair of young Satans.  Bursting their\njackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals\nCook can tempt them with.  Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and\nbread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday--and the poor woman fair\ninvented a pudding for them--and back it's sent.  She almost cried.\nShe's afraid she'll be blamed if they starve themselves into their\ngraves.\"\n\nDr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an\nextremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed\nhim the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to\nlook at--but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin's sofa\nand examined him.  He had been called to London on business and had not\nseen the boy for nearly two weeks.  When young things begin to gain\nhealth they gain it rapidly.  The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and\na warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the\nhollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out.  His\nonce dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily\nfrom his forehead and were soft and warm with life.  His lips were\nfuller and of a normal color.  In fact as an imitation of a boy who was\na confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight.  Dr. Craven held his\nchin in his hand and thought him over.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,\" he said.  \"That will\nnot do.  You will lose all you have gained--and you have gained\namazingly.  You ate so well a short time ago.\"\n\n\"I told you it was an unnatural appetite,\" answered Colin.\n\nMary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer\nsound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost\nchoking.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her.\n\nMary became quite severe in her manner.\n\n\"It was something between a sneeze and a cough,\" she replied with\nreproachful dignity, \"and it got into my throat.\"\n\n\"But,\" she said afterward to Colin, \"I couldn't stop myself.  It just\nburst out because all at once I couldn't help remembering that last big\npotato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through\nthat thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.\"\n\n\"Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?\" Dr.\nCraven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.\n\n\"There's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the\ntrees,\" Mrs. Medlock answered.  \"They stay out in the grounds all day\nand see no one but each other.  And if they want anything different to\neat from what's sent up to them they need only ask for it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dr. Craven, \"so long as going without food agrees with\nthem we need not disturb ourselves.  The boy is a new creature.\"\n\n\"So is the girl,\" said Mrs. Medlock.  \"She's begun to be downright\npretty since she's filled out and lost her ugly little sour look.  Her\nhair's grown thick and healthy looking and she's got a bright color.\nThe glummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and\nMaster Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones.  Perhaps\nthey're growing fat on that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they are,\" said Dr. Craven.  \"Let them laugh.\"\n\n\n\n\nAnd the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed\nnew miracles.  In the robin's nest there were Eggs and the robin's mate\nsat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and\ncareful wings.  At first she was very nervous and the robin himself was\nindignantly watchful.  Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown\ncorner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some\nmysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little\npair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like\nthemselves--nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what\nwas happening to them--the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking\nbeauty and solemnity of Eggs.  If there had been one person in that\ngarden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if\nan Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and\ncrash through space and come to an end--if there had been even one who\ndid not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness\neven in that golden springtime air.  But they all knew it and felt it\nand the robin and his mate knew they knew it.\n\nAt first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety.  For some\nmysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon.  The first moment\nhe set his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger\nbut a sort of robin without beak or feathers.  He could speak robin\n(which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other).\nTo speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman.\nDickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he\nused when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least.  The robin\nthought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not\nintelligent enough to understand feathered speech.  His movements also\nwere robin.  They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem\ndangerous or threatening.  Any robin could understand Dickon, so his\npresence was not even disturbing.\n\nBut at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other\ntwo.  In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden\non his legs.  He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of\nwild animals were thrown over him.  That in itself was doubtful.  Then\nwhen he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer\nunaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him.  The robin\nused to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head\ntilted first on one side and then on the other.  He thought that the\nslow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do.\nWhen cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very\nslowly.  The robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a\nfew days but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because\nher terror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the\nEggs.\n\nWhen the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it\nwas an immense relief.  But for a long time--or it seemed a long time\nto the robin--he was a source of some anxiety.  He did not act as the\nother humans did.  He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of\nsitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a\ndisconcerting manner to begin again.\n\nOne day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to\nlearn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing.\nHe had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to\nrest.  So it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly--or\nrather to walk.  He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her\nthat the Eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after\nthey were fledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly\ninterested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the\nedge of her nest--though she always thought that the Eggs would be much\ncleverer and learn more quickly.  But then she said indulgently that\nhumans were always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them\nnever seemed really to learn to fly at all.  You never met them in the\nair or on tree-tops.\n\nAfter a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all\nthree of the children at times did unusual things.  They would stand\nunder the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way\nwhich was neither walking nor running nor sitting down.  They went\nthrough these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never\nable to explain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do.  He\ncould only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in\nsuch a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was\ndoing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions\nwere not of a dangerous nature.  Of course neither the robin nor his\nmate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his\nexercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps.  Robins are not\nlike human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first\nand so they develop themselves in a natural manner.  If you have to fly\nabout to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied\n(atrophied means wasted away through want of use).\n\nWhen the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like\nthe others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace\nand content.  Fears for the Eggs became things of the past.  Knowing\nthat your Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and\nthe fact that you could watch so many curious things going on made\nsetting a most entertaining occupation.  On wet days the Eggs' mother\nsometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come\ninto the garden.\n\nBut even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were\ndull.  One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin\nwas beginning to feel a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on\nhis sofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an\ninspiration.\n\n\"Now that I am a real boy,\" Colin had said, \"my legs and arms and all\nmy body are so full of Magic that I can't keep them still.  They want\nto be doing things all the time.  Do you know that when I waken in the\nmorning, Mary, when it's quite early and the birds are just shouting\noutside and everything seems just shouting for joy--even the trees and\nthings we can't really hear--I feel as if I must jump out of bed and\nshout myself.  If I did it, just think what would happen!\"\n\nMary giggled inordinately.\n\n\"The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and\nthey would be sure you had gone crazy and they'd send for the doctor,\"\nshe said.\n\nColin giggled himself.  He could see how they would all look--how\nhorrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright.\n\n\"I wish my father would come home,\" he said.  \"I want to tell him\nmyself.  I'm always thinking about it--but we couldn't go on like this\nmuch longer.  I can't stand lying still and pretending, and besides I\nlook too different.  I wish it wasn't raining today.\"\n\nIt was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.\n\n\"Colin,\" she began mysteriously, \"do you know how many rooms there are\nin this house?\"\n\n\"About a thousand, I suppose,\" he answered.\n\n\"There's about a hundred no one ever goes into,\" said Mary.  \"And one\nrainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them.  No one ever\nknew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out.  I lost my way when I\nwas coming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor.  That was\nthe second time I heard you crying.\"\n\nColin started up on his sofa.\n\n\"A hundred rooms no one goes into,\" he said.  \"It sounds almost like a\nsecret garden.  Suppose we go and look at them.  Wheel me in my chair\nand nobody would know we went.\"\n\n\"That's what I was thinking,\" said Mary.  \"No one would dare to follow\nus.  There are galleries where you could run.  We could do our\nexercises.  There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full\nof ivory elephants.  There are all sorts of rooms.\"\n\n\"Ring the bell,\" said Colin.\n\nWhen the nurse came in he gave his orders.\n\n\"I want my chair,\" he said.  \"Miss Mary and I are going to look at the\npart of the house which is not used.  John can push me as far as the\npicture-gallery because there are some stairs.  Then he must go away\nand leave us alone until I send for him again.\"\n\nRainy days lost their terrors that morning.  When the footman had\nwheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in\nobedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted.  As\nsoon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to his\nown quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.\n\n\"I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,\" he said,\n\"and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth's\nexercises.\"\n\nAnd they did all these things and many others.  They looked at the\nportraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and\nholding the parrot on her finger.\n\n\"All these,\" said Colin, \"must be my relations.  They lived a long time\nago.  That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great,\ngreat aunts.  She looks rather like you, Mary--not as you look now but\nas you looked when you came here.  Now you are a great deal fatter and\nbetter looking.\"\n\n\"So are you,\" said Mary, and they both laughed.\n\nThey went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory\nelephants.  They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in\nthe cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away\nand the hole was empty.  They saw more rooms and made more discoveries\nthan Mary had made on her first pilgrimage.  They found new corridors\nand corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and\nweird old things they did not know the use of.  It was a curiously\nentertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same\nhouse with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were\nmiles away from them was a fascinating thing.\n\n\"I'm glad we came,\" Colin said.  \"I never knew I lived in such a big\nqueer old place.  I like it.  We will ramble about every rainy day.  We\nshall always be finding new queer corners and things.\"\n\nThat morning they had found among other things such good appetites that\nwhen they returned to Colin's room it was not possible to send the\nluncheon away untouched.\n\nWhen the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she slapped it down on the\nkitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly\npolished dishes and plates.\n\n\"Look at that!\" she said.  \"This is a house of mystery, and those two\nchildren are the greatest mysteries in it.\"\n\n\"If they keep that up every day,\" said the strong young footman John,\n\"there'd be small wonder that he weighs twice as much to-day as he did\na month ago.  I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of\ndoing my muscles an injury.\"\n\nThat afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin's\nroom.  She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because\nshe thought the change might have been made by chance.  She said\nnothing today but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the\nmantel.  She could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside.\nThat was the change she noticed.\n\n\"I know what you want me to tell you,\" said Colin, after she had stared\na few minutes.  \"I always know when you want me to tell you something.\nYou are wondering why the curtain is drawn back.  I am going to keep it\nlike that.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Mary.\n\n\"Because it doesn't make me angry any more to see her laughing.  I\nwakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the\nMagic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I\ncouldn't lie still.  I got up and looked out of the window.  The room\nwas quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and\nsomehow that made me go and pull the cord.  She looked right down at me\nas if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there.  It\nmade me like to look at her.  I want to see her laughing like that all\nthe time.  I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.\"\n\n\"You are so like her now,\" said Mary, \"that sometimes I think perhaps\nyou are her ghost made into a boy.\"\n\nThat idea seemed to impress Colin.  He thought it over and then\nanswered her slowly.\n\n\"If I were her ghost--my father would be fond of me.\"\n\n\"Do you want him to be fond of you?\" inquired Mary.\n\n\"I used to hate it because he was not fond of me.  If he grew fond of\nme I think I should tell him about the Magic.  It might make him more\ncheerful.\"\n\n\n\n\nTheir belief in the Magic was an abiding thing.  After the morning's\nincantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.\n\n\"I like to do it,\" he explained, \"because when I grow up and make great\nscientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so\nthis is practise.  I can only give short lectures now because I am very\nyoung, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church\nand he would go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Th' best thing about lecturin',\" said Ben, \"is that a chap can get up\nan' say aught he pleases an' no other chap can answer him back.  I\nwouldn't be agen' lecturin' a bit mysel' sometimes.\"\n\nBut when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes\non him and kept them there.  He looked him over with critical\naffection.  It was not so much the lecture which interested him as the\nlegs which looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head\nwhich held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks\nwhich had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold\nthe light he remembered in another pair.  Sometimes when Colin felt\nBen's earnest gaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he\nwas reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he\nquestioned him.\n\n\"What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?\" he asked.\n\n\"I was thinkin'\" answered Ben, \"as I'd warrant tha's, gone up three or\nfour pound this week.  I was lookin' at tha' calves an' tha' shoulders.\nI'd like to get thee on a pair o' scales.\"\n\n\"It's the Magic and--and Mrs. Sowerby's buns and milk and things,\" said\nColin.  \"You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.\"\n\nThat morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture.  When he came he\nwas ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than\nusual.  As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they\nfell to work.  They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking\nrain.  The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for\nthe weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves\nwhich must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold.  Colin\nwas as good at weeding as any one in these days and he could lecture\nwhile he was doing it.  \"The Magic works best when you work, yourself,\"\nhe said this morning.  \"You can feel it in your bones and muscles.  I\nam going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write\na book about Magic.  I am making it up now.  I keep finding out things.\"\n\nIt was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his\ntrowel and stood up on his feet.  He had been silent for several\nminutes and they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he\noften did.  When he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to\nMary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it.  He\nstretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms\nexultantly.  Color glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with\njoyfulness.  All at once he had realized something to the full.\n\n\"Mary! Dickon!\" he cried.  \"Just look at me!\"\n\nThey stopped their weeding and looked at him.\n\n\"Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?\" he\ndemanded.\n\nDickon was looking at him very hard.  Being an animal charmer he could\nsee more things than most people could and many of them were things he\nnever talked about.  He saw some of them now in this boy.  \"Aye, that\nwe do,\" he answered.\n\nMary looked hard too, but she said nothing.\n\n\"Just this minute,\" said Colin, \"all at once I remembered it\nmyself--when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel--and I had to\nstand up on my feet to see if it was real.  And it is real! I'm\nwell--I'm well!\"\n\n\"Aye, that th' art!\" said Dickon.\n\n\"I'm well! I'm well!\" said Colin again, and his face went quite red all\nover.\n\nHe had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and\nthought about it, but just at that minute something had rushed all\nthrough him--a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been\nso strong that he could not help calling out.\n\n\"I shall live forever and ever and ever!\" he cried grandly.  \"I shall\nfind out thousands and thousands of things.  I shall find out about\npeople and creatures and everything that grows--like Dickon--and I\nshall never stop making Magic.  I'm well! I'm well! I feel--I feel as\nif I want to shout out something--something thankful, joyful!\"\n\nBen Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round\nat him.\n\n\"Tha' might sing th' Doxology,\" he suggested in his dryest grunt.  He\nhad no opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the suggestion with\nany particular reverence.\n\nBut Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the\nDoxology.\n\n\"What is that?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Dickon can sing it for thee, I'll warrant,\" replied Ben Weatherstaff.\n\nDickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer's smile.\n\n\"They sing it i' church,\" he said.  \"Mother says she believes th'\nskylarks sings it when they gets up i' th' mornin'.\"\n\n\"If she says that, it must be a nice song,\" Colin answered.  \"I've\nnever been in a church myself.  I was always too ill.  Sing it, Dickon.\nI want to hear it.\"\n\nDickon was quite simple and unaffected about it.  He understood what\nColin felt better than Colin did himself.  He understood by a sort of\ninstinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding.  He\npulled off his cap and looked round still smiling.\n\n\"Tha' must take off tha' cap,\" he said to Colin, \"an' so mun tha',\nBen--an' tha' mun stand up, tha' knows.\"\n\nColin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair\nas he watched Dickon intently.  Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his\nknees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look\non his old face as if he didn't know exactly why he was doing this\nremarkable thing.\n\nDickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in\nquite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:\n\n         \"Praise God from whom all blessings flow,\n         Praise Him all creatures here below,\n         Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host,\n         Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\n                     Amen.\"\n\nWhen he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with\nhis jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed on\nColin.  Colin's face was thoughtful and appreciative.\n\n\"It is a very nice song,\" he said.  \"I like it.  Perhaps it means just\nwhat I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.\"\nHe stopped and thought in a puzzled way.  \"Perhaps they are both the\nsame thing.  How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it\nagain, Dickon.  Let us try, Mary.  I want to sing it, too.  It's my\nsong.  How does it begin? 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow'?\"\n\nAnd they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as\nmusically as they could and Dickon's swelled quite loud and\nbeautiful--and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared\nhis throat and at the third line he joined in with such vigor that it\nseemed almost savage and when the \"Amen\" came to an end Mary observed\nthat the very same thing had happened to him which had happened when he\nfound out that Colin was not a cripple--his chin was twitching and he\nwas staring and winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet.\n\n\"I never seed no sense in th' Doxology afore,\" he said hoarsely, \"but I\nmay change my mind i' time.  I should say tha'd gone up five pound this\nweek Mester Colin--five on 'em!\"\n\nColin was looking across the garden at something attracting his\nattention and his expression had become a startled one.\n\n\"Who is coming in here?\" he said quickly.  \"Who is it?\"\n\nThe door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had\nentered.  She had come in with the last line of their song and she had\nstood still listening and looking at them.  With the ivy behind her,\nthe sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue\ncloak, and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was\nrather like a softly colored illustration in one of Colin's books.  She\nhad wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in--all\nof them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the \"creatures\" and every flower\nthat was in bloom.  Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them\nfelt that she was an intruder at all.  Dickon's eyes lighted like lamps.\n\n\"It's mother--that's who it is!\" he cried and went across the grass at\na run.\n\nColin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him.  They both\nfelt their pulses beat faster.\n\n\"It's mother!\" Dickon said again when they met halfway.  \"I knowed tha'\nwanted to see her an' I told her where th' door was hid.\"\n\nColin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his\neyes quite devoured her face.\n\n\"Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,\" he said, \"you and Dickon and\nthe secret garden.  I'd never wanted to see any one or anything before.\"\n\nThe sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her\nown.  She flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed\nto sweep over her eyes.\n\n\"Eh! dear lad!\" she broke out tremulously.  \"Eh! dear lad!\" as if she\nhad not known she were going to say it.  She did not say, \"Mester\nColin,\" but just \"dear lad\" quite suddenly.  She might have said it to\nDickon in the same way if she had seen something in his face which\ntouched her.  Colin liked it.\n\n\"Are you surprised because I am so well?\" he asked.  She put her hand\non his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.  \"Aye, that I am!\"\nshe said; \"but tha'rt so like thy mother tha' made my heart jump.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Colin a little awkwardly, \"that will make my\nfather like me?\"\n\n\"Aye, for sure, dear lad,\" she answered and she gave his shoulder a\nsoft quick pat.  \"He mun come home--he mun come home.\"\n\n\"Susan Sowerby,\" said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her.  \"Look at\nth' lad's legs, wilt tha'? They was like drumsticks i' stockin' two\nmonth' ago--an' I heard folk tell as they was bandy an' knock-kneed\nboth at th' same time.  Look at 'em now!\"\n\nSusan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.\n\n\"They're goin' to be fine strong lad's legs in a bit,\" she said.  \"Let\nhim go on playin' an' workin' in the garden an' eatin' hearty an'\ndrinkin' plenty o' good sweet milk an' there'll not be a finer pair i'\nYorkshire, thank God for it.\"\n\nShe put both hands on Mistress Mary's shoulders and looked her little\nface over in a motherly fashion.\n\n\"An' thee, too!\" she said.  \"Tha'rt grown near as hearty as our\n'Lisabeth Ellen.  I'll warrant tha'rt like thy mother too.  Our Martha\ntold me as Mrs. Medlock heard she was a pretty woman.  Tha'lt be like a\nblush rose when tha' grows up, my little lass, bless thee.\"\n\nShe did not mention that when Martha came home on her \"day out\" and\ndescribed the plain sallow child she had said that she had no\nconfidence whatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard.  \"It doesn't stand\nto reason that a pretty woman could be th' mother o' such a fou' little\nlass,\" she had added obstinately.\n\nMary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face.  She\nhad only known that she looked \"different\" and seemed to have a great\ndeal more hair and that it was growing very fast.  But remembering her\npleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she was glad to hear\nthat she might some day look like her.\n\nSusan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole\nstory of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive.  Colin\nwalked on one side of her and Mary on the other.  Each of them kept\nlooking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the\ndelightful feeling she gave them--a sort of warm, supported feeling.\nIt seemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his\n\"creatures.\" She stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if\nthey were children.  Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her\nand flew upon her shoulder as if it were Dickon's. When they told her\nabout the robin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a\nmotherly little mellow laugh in her throat.\n\n\"I suppose learnin' 'em to fly is like learnin' children to walk, but\nI'm feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o'\nlegs,\" she said.\n\nIt was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorland\ncottage way that at last she was told about the Magic.\n\n\"Do you believe in Magic?\" asked Colin after he had explained about\nIndian fakirs.  \"I do hope you do.\"\n\n\"That I do, lad,\" she answered.  \"I never knowed it by that name but\nwhat does th' name matter? I warrant they call it a different name i'\nFrance an' a different one i' Germany.  Th' same thing as set th' seeds\nswellin' an' th' sun shinin' made thee a well lad an' it's th' Good\nThing.  It isn't like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called\nout of our names.  Th' Big Good Thing doesn't stop to worrit, bless\nthee.  It goes on makin' worlds by th' million--worlds like us.  Never\nthee stop believin' in th' Big Good Thing an' knowin' th' world's full\nof it--an' call it what tha' likes.  Tha' wert singin' to it when I\ncome into th' garden.\"\n\n\"I felt so joyful,\" said Colin, opening his beautiful strange eyes at\nher.  \"Suddenly I felt how different I was--how strong my arms and legs\nwere, you know--and how I could dig and stand--and I jumped up and\nwanted to shout out something to anything that would listen.\"\n\n\"Th' Magic listened when tha' sung th' Doxology.  It would ha' listened\nto anything tha'd sung.  It was th' joy that mattered.  Eh! lad,\nlad--what's names to th' Joy Maker,\" and she gave his shoulders a quick\nsoft pat again.\n\nShe had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and\nwhen the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding\nplace, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour\ntheir food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites.  She was\nfull of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things.  She told\nthem stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words.  She laughed\nas if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing\ndifficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful\ninvalid.\n\n\"You see we can't help laughing nearly all the time when we are\ntogether,\" explained Colin.  \"And it doesn't sound ill at all.  We try\nto choke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.\"\n\n\"There's one thing that comes into my mind so often,\" said Mary, \"and I\ncan scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly.  I keep thinking\nsuppose Colin's face should get to look like a full moon.  It isn't\nlike one yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day--and suppose some\nmorning it should look like one--what should we do!\"\n\n\"Bless us all, I can see tha' has a good bit o' play actin' to do,\"\nsaid Susan Sowerby.  \"But tha' won't have to keep it up much longer.\nMester Craven'll come home.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will?\" asked Colin.  \"Why?\"\n\nSusan Sowerby chuckled softly.\n\n\"I suppose it 'ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha' told\nhim in tha' own way,\" she said.  \"Tha's laid awake nights plannin' it.\"\n\n\"I couldn't bear any one else to tell him,\" said Colin.  \"I think about\ndifferent ways every day, I think now I just want to run into his\nroom.\" \"That'd be a fine start for him,\" said Susan Sowerby.  \"I'd like\nto see his face, lad.  I would that! He mun come back--that he mun.\"\n\nOne of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to her\ncottage.  They planned it all.  They were to drive over the moor and\nlunch out of doors among the heather.  They would see all the twelve\nchildren and Dickon's garden and would not come back until they were\ntired.\n\nSusan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock.\nIt was time for Colin to be wheeled back also.  But before he got into\nhis chair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with\na kind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold\nof her blue cloak and held it fast.\n\n\"You are just what I--what I wanted,\" he said.  \"I wish you were my\nmother--as well as Dickon's!\"\n\nAll at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm arms\nclose against the bosom under the blue cloak--as if he had been\nDickon's brother.  The quick mist swept over her eyes.\n\n\"Eh! dear lad!\" she said.  \"Thy own mother's in this 'ere very garden,\nI do believe.  She couldna' keep out of it.  Thy father mun come back\nto thee--he mun!\"\n\n\n\n\nIn each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have\nbeen discovered.  In the last century more amazing things were found\nout than in any century before.  In this new century hundreds of things\nstill more astounding will be brought to light.  At first people refuse\nto believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to\nhope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and\nall the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.  One of the\nnew things people began to find out in the last century was that\nthoughts--just mere thoughts--are as powerful as electric batteries--as\ngood for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.  To let a sad\nthought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a\nscarlet fever germ get into your body.  If you let it stay there after\nit has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.\n\nSo long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about\nher dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to\nbe pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced,\nsickly, bored and wretched child.  Circumstances, however, were very\nkind to her, though she was not at all aware of it.  They began to push\nher about for her own good.  When her mind gradually filled itself with\nrobins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed\nold gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime\nand with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor\nboy and his \"creatures,\" there was no room left for the disagreeable\nthoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow\nand tired.\n\nSo long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his\nfears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and\nreflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical\nhalf-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and\nthe spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand\nupon his feet if he tried to do it.  When new beautiful thoughts began\nto push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his\nblood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like\na flood.  His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and\nthere was nothing weird about it at all.  Much more surprising things\ncan happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought\ncomes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it\nout by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.  Two things\ncannot be in one place.\n\n         \"Where, you tend a rose, my lad,\n         A thistle cannot grow.\"\n\nWhile the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming\nalive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away\nbeautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains\nof Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind\nfilled with dark and heart-broken thinking.  He had not been\ncourageous; he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place\nof the dark ones.  He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he\nhad lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming\nall about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought\nthem.  A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and\nhe had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused\nobstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.  He had\nforgotten and deserted his home and his duties.  When he traveled\nabout, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong\ndone to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him\nwith gloom.  Most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man\nwith some hidden crime on his soul.  He, was a tall man with a drawn\nface and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel\nregisters was, \"Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire,\nEngland.\"\n\nHe had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his\nstudy and told her she might have her \"bit of earth.\" He had been in\nthe most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere\nmore than a few days.  He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots.\nHe had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and\nhad looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them\nwith such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.\n\nBut the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he\nrealized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had\nhappened.  He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he\nhad been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any\nman's soul out of shadow.  He had walked a long way and it had not\nlifted his.  But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down\nto rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.  It was a clear little stream\nwhich ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious\ndamp greenness.  Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low\nlaughter as it bubbled over and round stones.  He saw birds come and\ndip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away.\nIt seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness\nseem deeper.  The valley was very, very still.\n\nAs he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven\ngradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the\nvalley itself.  He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.\nHe sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things\ngrowing at its edge.  There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots\ngrowing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he\nfound himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things\nyears ago.  He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and\nwhat wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.  He did not\nknow that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind--filling\nand filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.  It was as\nif a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had\nrisen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away.  But of\ncourse he did not think of this himself.  He only knew that the valley\nseemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright\ndelicate blueness.  He did not know how long he sat there or what was\nhappening to him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he\ngot up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft\nbreath and wondering at himself.  Something seemed to have been unbound\nand released in him, very quietly.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand over\nhis forehead.  \"I almost feel as if--I were alive!\"\n\nI do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to\nbe able to explain how this had happened to him.  Neither does any one\nelse yet.  He did not understand at all himself--but he remembered this\nstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he\nfound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out\nas he went into the secret garden:\n\n\"I am going to live forever and ever and ever!\"\n\nThe singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he\nslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long.  He did\nnot know that it could be kept.  By the next night he had opened the\ndoors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing\nback.  He left the valley and went on his wandering way again.  But,\nstrange as it seemed to him, there were minutes--sometimes\nhalf-hours--when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to\nlift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.\nSlowly--slowly--for no reason that he knew of--he was \"coming alive\"\nwith the garden.\n\nAs the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the\nLake of Como.  There he found the loveliness of a dream.  He spent his\ndays upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the\nsoft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that\nhe might sleep.  But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he\nknew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he thought, \"my body is growing stronger.\"\n\nIt was growing stronger but--because of the rare peaceful hours when\nhis thoughts were changed--his soul was slowly growing stronger, too.\nHe began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.\nNow and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what\nhe should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed\nagain and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it\nslept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.\nHe shrank from it.\n\nOne marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon\nwas high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver.  The\nstillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not\ngo into the villa he lived in.  He walked down to a little bowered\nterrace at the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the\nheavenly scents of the night.  He felt the strange calmness stealing\nover him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.\n\nHe did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his\ndream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming.  He\nremembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought\nhe was.  He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the\nlate roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he\nheard a voice calling.  It was sweet and clear and happy and far away.\nIt seemed very far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at\nhis very side.\n\n\"Archie! Archie! Archie!\" it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer\nthan before, \"Archie! Archie!\"\n\nHe thought he sprang to his feet not even startled.  It was such a real\nvoice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.\n\n\"Lilias! Lilias!\" he answered.  \"Lilias! where are you?\"\n\n\"In the garden,\" it came back like a sound from a golden flute.  \"In\nthe garden!\"\n\nAnd then the dream ended.  But he did not awaken.  He slept soundly and\nsweetly all through the lovely night.  When he did awake at last it was\nbrilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him.  He was an\nItalian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa\nwere, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign\nmaster might do.  No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or\nwhere he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or\nlie in the boat on the lake all night.  The man held a salver with some\nletters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them.  When\nhe had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand\nand looking at the lake.  His strange calm was still upon him and\nsomething more--a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done\nhad not happened as he thought--as if something had changed.  He was\nremembering the dream--the real--real dream.\n\n\"In the garden!\" he said, wondering at himself.  \"In the garden! But\nthe door is locked and the key is buried deep.\"\n\nWhen he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one\nlying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from\nYorkshire.  It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a\nhand he knew.  He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the\nfirst words attracted his attention at once.\n\n\n\"Dear Sir:\n\nI am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor.  It\nwas about Miss Mary I spoke.  I will make bold to speak again.  Please,\nsir, I would come home if I was you.  I think you would be glad to come\nand--if you will excuse me, sir--I think your lady would ask you to\ncome if she was here.\n\n                      Your obedient servant,\n                      Susan Sowerby.\"\n\n\nMr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.\nHe kept thinking about the dream.\n\n\"I will go back to Misselthwaite,\" he said.  \"Yes, I'll go at once.\"\n\nAnd he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to\nprepare for his return to England.\n\n\nIn a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad\njourney he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in\nall the ten years past.  During those years he had only wished to\nforget him.  Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories\nof him constantly drifted into his mind.  He remembered the black days\nwhen he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the\nmother was dead.  He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to\nlook at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that\neveryone had been sure it would die in a few days.  But to the surprise\nof those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then\neveryone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.\n\nHe had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father\nat all.  He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had\nshrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his\nown misery.  The first time after a year's absence he returned to\nMisselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and\nindifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes\nround them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had\nadored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as\ndeath.  After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,\nand all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a\nvicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.  He could only be kept from\nfuries dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.\n\nAll this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled\nhim through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was \"coming\nalive\" began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and\ndeeply.\n\n\"Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,\" he said to himself.\n\"Ten years is a long time.  It may be too late to do anything--quite\ntoo late.  What have I been thinking of!\"\n\nOf course this was the wrong Magic--to begin by saying \"too late.\" Even\nColin could have told him that.  But he knew nothing of Magic--either\nblack or white.  This he had yet to learn.  He wondered if Susan\nSowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly\ncreature had realized that the boy was much worse--was fatally ill.  If\nhe had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken\npossession of him he would have been more wretched than ever.  But the\ncalm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.  Instead of giving\nway to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe\nin better things.\n\n\"Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him good\nand control him?\" he thought.  \"I will go and see her on my way to\nMisselthwaite.\"\n\nBut when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the\ncottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a\ngroup and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him\nthat their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the\nmorning to help a woman who had a new baby.  \"Our Dickon,\" they\nvolunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where\nhe went several days each week.\n\nMr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round\nred-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he\nawoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot.  He smiled at\ntheir friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and\ngave it to \"our 'Lizabeth Ellen\" who was the oldest.\n\n\"If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for\neach of, you,\" he said.\n\nThen amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away,\nleaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.\n\nThe drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.\nWhy did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been\nsure he could never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and\nsky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing,\nnearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six\nhundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering\nto think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed\nwith the brocaded hangings.  Was it possible that perhaps he might find\nhim changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his\nshrinking from him?  How real that dream had been--how wonderful and\nclear the voice which called back to him, \"In the garden--In the\ngarden!\"\n\n\"I will try to find the key,\" he said.  \"I will try to open the door.\nI must--though I don't know why.\"\n\nWhen he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the\nusual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to\nthe remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher.  He went\ninto the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock.  She came to him somewhat\nexcited and curious and flustered.\n\n\"How is Master Colin, Medlock?\" he inquired.  \"Well, sir,\" Mrs. Medlock\nanswered, \"he's--he's different, in a manner of speaking.\"\n\n\"Worse?\" he suggested.\n\nMrs. Medlock really was flushed.\n\n\"Well, you see, sir,\" she tried to explain, \"neither Dr. Craven, nor\nthe nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might be\nchanging for the worse.  His appetite, sir, is past understanding--and\nhis ways--\"\n\n\"Has he become more--more peculiar?\" her master, asked, knitting his\nbrows anxiously.\n\n\"That's it, sir.  He's growing very peculiar--when you compare him with\nwhat he used to be.  He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began\nto eat something enormous--and then he stopped again all at once and\nthe meals were sent back just as they used to be.  You never knew, sir,\nperhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken.  The\nthings we've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave\na body trembling like a leaf.  He'd throw himself into such a state\nthat Dr. Craven said he couldn't be responsible for forcing him.  Well,\nsir, just without warning--not long after one of his worst tantrums he\nsuddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan\nSowerby's boy Dickon that could push his chair.  He took a fancy to\nboth Miss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if\nyou'll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until\nnight.\"\n\n\"How does he look?\" was the next question.\n\n\"If he took his food natural, sir, you'd think he was putting on\nflesh--but we're afraid it may be a sort of bloat.  He laughs sometimes\nin a queer way when he's alone with Miss Mary.  He never used to laugh\nat all.  Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you'll allow him.\nHe never was as puzzled in his life.\"\n\n\"Where is Master Colin now?\" Mr. Craven asked.\n\n\"In the garden, sir.  He's always in the garden--though not a human\ncreature is allowed to go near for fear they'll look at him.\"\n\nMr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.\n\n\"In the garden,\" he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he\nstood and repeated it again and again.  \"In the garden!\"\n\nHe had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was\nstanding in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went\nout of the room.  He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door\nin the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.  The\nfountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn\nflowers.  He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the\nivied walls.  He did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on\nthe path.  He felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had\nso long forsaken, and he did not know why.  As he drew near to it his\nstep became still more slow.  He knew where the door was even though\nthe ivy hung thick over it--but he did not know exactly where it\nlay--that buried key.\n\nSo he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment\nafter he had paused he started and listened--asking himself if he were\nwalking in a dream.\n\nThe ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs,\nno human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years--and yet\ninside the garden there were sounds.  They were the sounds of running\nscuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they\nwere strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices--exclamations and\nsmothered joyous cries.  It seemed actually like the laughter of young\nthings, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to\nbe heard but who in a moment or so--as their excitement mounted--would\nburst forth.  What in heaven's name was he dreaming of--what in\nheaven's name did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he\nheard things which were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear\nvoice had meant?\n\nAnd then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds\nforgot to hush themselves.  The feet ran faster and faster--they were\nnearing the garden door--there was quick strong young breathing and a\nwild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained--and the\ndoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back,\nand a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the\noutsider, dashed almost into his arms.\n\nMr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a\nresult of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to\nlook at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.\n\nHe was a tall boy and a handsome one.  He was glowing with life and his\nrunning had sent splendid color leaping to his face.  He threw the\nthick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray\neyes--eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a\nfringe.  It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.\n\"Who--What? Who!\" he stammered.\n\nThis was not what Colin had expected--this was not what he had planned.\nHe had never thought of such a meeting.  And yet to come dashing\nout--winning a race--perhaps it was even better.  He drew himself up to\nhis very tallest.  Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed\nthrough the door too, believed that he managed to make himself look\ntaller than he had ever looked before--inches taller.\n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"I'm Colin.  You can't believe it.  I scarcely can\nmyself.  I'm Colin.\"\n\nLike Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he\nsaid hurriedly:\n\n\"In the garden! In the garden!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" hurried on Colin.  \"It was the garden that did it--and Mary and\nDickon and the creatures--and the Magic.  No one knows.  We kept it to\ntell you when you came.  I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race.  I'm\ngoing to be an athlete.\"\n\nHe said it all so like a healthy boy--his face flushed, his words\ntumbling over each other in his eagerness--that Mr. Craven's soul shook\nwith unbelieving joy.\n\nColin put out his hand and laid it on his father's arm.\n\n\"Aren't you glad, Father?\" he ended.  \"Aren't you glad?  I'm going to\nlive forever and ever and ever!\"\n\nMr. Craven put his hands on both the boy's shoulders and held him\nstill.  He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.\n\n\"Take me into the garden, my boy,\" he said at last.  \"And tell me all\nabout it.\"\n\nAnd so they led him in.\n\nThe place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue\nand flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies\nstanding together--lilies which were white or white and ruby.  He\nremembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at\nthis season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.\nLate roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening\nthe hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an\nembowered temple of gold.  The newcomer stood silent just as the\nchildren had done when they came into its grayness.  He looked round\nand round.\n\n\"I thought it would be dead,\" he said.\n\n\"Mary thought so at first,\" said Colin.  \"But it came alive.\"\n\nThen they sat down under their tree--all but Colin, who wanted to stand\nwhile he told the story.\n\nIt was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought,\nas it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.  Mystery and Magic and\nwild creatures, the weird midnight meeting--the coming of the\nspring--the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah\nto his feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face.  The odd\ncompanionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept.\nThe listener laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears\ncame into his eyes when he was not laughing.  The Athlete, the\nLecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy\nyoung human thing.\n\n\"Now,\" he said at the end of the story, \"it need not be a secret any\nmore.  I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see\nme--but I am never going to get into the chair again.  I shall walk\nback with you, Father--to the house.\"\n\n\nBen Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on\nthis occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen\nand being invited into the servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a\nglass of beer he was on the spot--as he had hoped to be--when the most\ndramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present\ngeneration actually took place.  One of the windows looking upon the\ncourtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.  Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben\nhad come from the gardens, hoped that he might have caught sight of his\nmaster and even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin.\n\n\"Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?\" she asked.\n\nBen took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back\nof his hand.\n\n\"Aye, that I did,\" he answered with a shrewdly significant air.\n\n\"Both of them?\" suggested Mrs. Medlock.\n\n\"Both of 'em,\" returned Ben Weatherstaff.  \"Thank ye kindly, ma'am, I\ncould sup up another mug of it.\"\n\n\"Together?\" said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her\nexcitement.\n\n\"Together, ma'am,\" and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.\n\n\"Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to each\nother?\"\n\n\"I didna' hear that,\" said Ben, \"along o' only bein' on th' stepladder\nlookin, over th' wall.  But I'll tell thee this.  There's been things\ngoin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about.  An' what tha'll\nfind out tha'll find out soon.\"\n\nAnd it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and\nwaved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the\nshrubbery a piece of the lawn.\n\n\"Look there,\" he said, \"if tha's curious.  Look what's comin' across\nth' grass.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little\nshriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the\nservants' hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes\nalmost starting out of their heads.\n\nAcross the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many\nof them had never seen him.  And by his, side with his head up in the\nair and his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as\nany boy in Yorkshire--Master Colin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":19148.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 22-27","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201112141827\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-secret-garden\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-22-27","summary_text":"In the secret garden, Colin continues to stand up straight and can even walk. Ben Weatherstaff enters the garden and Colin draws attention to himself, demanding to know from Ben if he sees him as a hunchback. Ben responds that he is not, and that everyone has been a fool to believe that Colin would die. Ben tells Colin about how the garden belonged to Mrs. Craven, his mother. Colin declares that now it is his and that it must be left a secret. Ben reveals that he has been in the secret garden before by climbing over the wall, which explains how the roses in the garden look pruned. As the sun goes down, Ben Weatherstaff presents Colin with a potted rose, which Colin plants in the soil himself. When Colin returns for the night, Dr. Craven warns him to minimize his time spent outside, and Colin responds defiantly that he will be going out every day and that he can't be stopped. Mary notices Colin's rude way of ordering around people and tells him directly that he could have better manners. Colin is surprised to hear that he behaves in this strange way, but he vows to keep visiting the garden, where he will be transformed by Magic. In the following months, many magical things take place in the garden as the flowers start budding. Colin continues to spend time there every day, watching things grow. Colin believes that it is the Magic that allowed him to stand for the first time in the garden. One day, Colin calls over Ben Weatherstaff, Mary, and Dickon to declare that when he grows up he will be a scientist who studies Magic. He proposes they do an experiment where every day they each affirm that Magic is inside of them and is making them well and to observe the results. They then sit cross-legged in a circle under the tree to start the experiment. Colin repeats a chant about how Magic lives through all of life, including in them. They then form a procession through the garden where Colin continues to declare that Magic is making him strong. He has made himself believe that he is not sick anymore and imagines what his father would think when he sees him well. The children continue to do these ceremonies regularly. Dickon starts working at another garden near his cottage. His mother, Mrs. Sowerby, enjoys going out to this garden and talking to the boy. There, Dickon divulges to her all the things that have been happening at Misselthwaite Manor and she becomes in on the secret. Mrs. Sowerby offers to prepare the children milk and bread to enjoy during their days in the garden, in order to help Colin and Mary fatten up. Dr. Craven and the nurses are beginning to notice Colin's increased appetite, so he can't ask for more food. He tries to not make himself seem too healthy, as he doesn't want anyone to find out about the secret garden and interfere with the children's daily routine. When the doctor proposes writing to Colin's father to tell him of his improving health, Colin panics and considers he might have to start eating less in order to discourage Dr. Craven. Mary and Colin find it difficult to eat less, however, because their appetites are growing each day. Thus they are delighted to receive the food from Mrs. Sowerby. Not wanting to put too much pressure on Dickon's mother to feed them, they also create a tiny oven in a hollow near the garden, in which the children cook potatoes and eggs. Becoming stronger, Colin is able to stand and walk more and more. The manor staff are perplexed at how the children can grow so strong and look so healthy while eating so little. The garden is blooming more and more and the robins are hatching eggs, which is described as a miracle. The robin's perspective is given, where he reveals that he trusts Dickon around the eggs but not necessarily Colin and Mary. The robins observe Colin learning to walk and conclude that the boy is learning to fly. On a rainy day, Mary and Colin amuse themselves by exploring the unused rooms in the mansion. Their playing causes them to have a great appetite and they both finish their lunches for the first time in awhile, much to the happiness of the staff. Later, Mary notices that Colin has removed the curtain from his mother's portrait in his room. Colin continues to lecture the children and Ben Weatherstaff about Magic, even while they are at work weeding in the garden. One day, Ben suggests Dickon sing the \"Doxology,\" a hymn which praises God and all His creatures. As the children sing the hymn, a woman with affectionate eyes and a long blue cloak enters. It is Dickon's mother. She is surprised and happy to see Colin so well. She is also shocked because of the uncanny resemblance Colin bears to his own mother. She also notices how much Mary has grown healthier. The children ask her if she believes in Magic, to which she says yes, calling it the \"Big Good Thing\" in which they must always put their faith. The last chapter starts with narration about how the power of thoughts will be discovered and better understood in the 20th century. For instance, a bad thought can negatively affect the body just as much as a disease. This is shown through the characters of Mary and Colin. The narrator speaks of Mr. Craven, who for 10 years has thought only negatively and has not had the courage to be more positive, even while traveling throughout beautiful places in Europe. One day, while sitting by a stream in Austria, he starts thinking of the site's beauty and he suddenly feels alive for the first time in years. He can't maintain this new hope all the time, but he feels over the next few days that his usual sense of burden periodically lifts. One night, Mr. Craven dreams of hearing Mrs. Craven's voice calling to him, telling him that she is in their special garden. The next day, he receives a letter from Mrs. Sowerby advising him to come home, and that Mrs. Craven would want him to come if she were alive. Mr. Craven makes the journey back, thinking of Colin in a way he hasn't in years. He reflects on how he has not been the best father to Colin, avoiding him because of his resemblance to his wife. As he arrives back at the manor, he thinks about how he will find the key to the secret garden. Mrs. Medlock updates Mr. Craven on Colin's new behaviors and habit of going outdoors every single day. Mr. Craven hurriedly goes to the secret garden. Outside its walls he is surprised to hear commotion and laughter of children. All of a sudden, Colin bursts out of the garden door and bumps directly into his father. Mr. Craven is astonished yet happy to see Colin standing, looking healthy and vibrant. Colin takes him into the garden and tells him everything: about the Magic, the creatures, and his new friends. Mr. Craven laughs and cries with joy at hearing his son's story. The manor servants are completely shocked when they see out the window a healthy-looking Colin and his father walking together towards the house.","summary_analysis":"In the last sections of The Secret Garden, author Frances Hodgson Burnett masterfully ties together the different aspects of the plot to create the ultimate happily-ever-after resolution. No character in this story is left unaccounted for, as evident in the way each one makes some sort of appearance and finds their own sense of peace after experiencing great challenges and struggles. For instance, when the groundskeeper Ben Weatherstaff catches the children in the garden, his initial dismay transforms into happy astonishment at seeing the once crippled Colin standing and playing like a normal child. Through witnessing this, Ben can at last feel a sort of closure after many years of tending to the garden in secret. In the final chapters, Ben ultimately finds himself participating alongside Mary, Dickon, and Colin in the care taking of the garden and the magical ceremonies they create. There is a great deal of symbolism in Colin's presence in the garden, especially at the moment he plants a rose, the favorite flower of his mother. In this act, we are shown how despite the tragic passing of Mrs. Craven, life always continues, even after what seems like a final death. Her continuation is both literally through her son and more metaphysically through the joy and hope of the children who are determined to nurture and revive a garden on the verge of decay. In this way, the spirit of Mrs. Craven is truly honored and kept alive, as those things she loved most are not forgotten. Finally, Colin is willing to remove the curtain that long covered his mother's portrait, as he is now able to see her happy expression not as a threat, but as an invitation to cultivate his own happiness. The importance of nature in maintaining health and happiness is a theme emphasized over and over again. When Colin finds the strength to stand for the first time in ages, it is attributed to the magic of the secret garden, and on a deeper level, the magic of life. While Colin was once resigned to the role of perpetually sick patient, being outside has awakened in him a recognition of his own innate power as a human being embedded in nature. This is demonstrated in his chanting about how Magic is within him and within all of life. In direct contact with sunlight and soil, no longer does he, nor Mary for that matter, feel a sense of separation between themselves and the world at large. The most significant moment of resolution occurs in the final chapter, when Archibald Craven returns to his manor to find the children in what he had believed was a locked up and neglected garden. The transformation of Mr. Craven occurs in a mystical way: first, while sitting by a river, he miraculously experiences a profound sense of peace that stands in stark contrast to his habitual malaise. Next, he dreams that his wife calls to him to come into the garden. Then, the following day he receives a letter from Mrs. Sowerby urging him to return home. It is as if life itself is guiding the grieving man out of his deadened state, to embrace the possibility that not all has failed; that his son is not actually dying, but increasingly healthy; that his wife is not forever gone but living on through her reborn garden. Stylistically, there are certain moments in the narrative when the usual, intimate third-person narration is interrupted with a more direct address to the reader, such as in the beginning of Chapter 27, or in Chapter 23. Here, the author seems to zoom out in her focus on Mary, Colin, and Dickon to instead discuss issues of belief and magic in a wider context. In this way, the reader is asked to contemplate these philosophical themes and make more powerful conclusions about why the characters behave in the way they do. For example, when we see that Mr. Craven has denied his own magical ability to heal from grief, we can better comprehend his neglectful mode of parenting or his tendency for seclusion. In this way, the reader is truly encouraged to hold compassion for all characters and recognize the possibility for anyone to transform into a better person.","summary_length":1236.0,"analysis_length":708.0,"chap_int":27,"previous summary id":["chapter 26","chapter xxvi"],"previous chapter":["Colin has found a new hobby: He likes to lecture about the Magic to anyone who will listen . As Colin is weeding and working in the garden, he suddenly realizes that he is doing as good a job as Mary and Dickon. In fact, Colin has become completely well. He is so happy that he wants to sing--something. Ben Weatherstaff isn't religious, but he suggests the \"Doxology\" . Colin has never actually been to church, since he's been too sick, so Dickon does the singing. And Colin decides that his Magic and the God of the Doxology might be the same thing. As they are finishing up their singing, a woman walks into the garden: Mrs. Sowerby, Dickon's mother. As soon as Mrs. Sowerby sees Colin, she tells him that he is just like his mother, and that Mr. Craven has to come home right away to see. She also admires Mary, who is growing into a pretty girl. Mrs. Sowerby agrees that the Magic is just one name for what she calls \"the Good Thing\" . It doesn't matter what people call it, as long as they have faith. Mrs. Sowerby says they won't have to keep up this act of Colin's ill health for much longer--Mr. Craven will come home soon. As Colin is leaving that afternoon, he tells Mrs. Sowerby that he wishes she were his mother as well as Dickon's. Mrs. Sowerby is so moved that she promises Colin that his mother is in this garden with him--and, again, Mr. Craven will be home soon.","While Colin is lecturing in the garden, Ben Weatherstaff marvels at how strong he has become, and at how much he looks like his mother. Colin says that his experiment has succeeded, and that he intends to write a book about Magic quite soon. Suddenly overwhelmed by the miracle of his own health, he leaps up and shouts that he \"shall live forever and ever and ever. Ben Weatherstaff suggests that Colin sing the Doxology  to express his joy and thankfulness. Dickon tells them that he and his mother believe that the skylarks themselves sing this hymn, which runs: \"Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise Him all creatures here below, Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host, Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Colin immediately likes the song, and remarks that it means precisely what he does when he says that he is thankful to the Magic; perhaps God and Magic \"are the same thing. Suddenly, Mrs. Sowerby appears at the garden door, and Dickon immediately runs to her. She is a beautiful woman with gentle, all-encompassing eyes; she wears a long blue cloak that appears very picturesque in the dappled sunlight. She, too, is taken aback by how much Colin looks like his mother. Mrs. Sowerby is full of affection for him, and calls Colin \"lad\" as if he were her own child. She also embraces Mary, exclaims of her prettiness, and compares her to one of her own daughters. The children show Mrs. Sowerby every part of the secret garden; Colin and Mary are irresistibly drawn to the \"warm, supported feeling\" that she inspires in both of them. Colin asks her if she believes in Magic, and she ardently replies that she does, although she doesn't call it by that name. For Mrs. Sowerby, it does not matter what its proper name is: it is merely \"the Big Good Thing,\" the \"Joy Maker. The group vows to make a visit to the Sowerbys' cottage. Mrs. Sowerby says that Master Craven must come home soon, so that he might see the dramatic change in his son. Colin is very touched, and says that he wishes that she were his mother as well as Dickon's. She embraces him and tells him that his own mother is present in the garden."],"next summary id":"chapters 22-27","next chapter":"In the secret garden, Colin continues to stand up straight and can even walk. Ben Weatherstaff enters the garden and Colin draws attention to himself, demanding to know from Ben if he sees him as a hunchback. Ben responds that he is not, and that everyone has been a fool to believe that Colin would die. Ben tells Colin about how the garden belonged to Mrs. Craven, his mother. Colin declares that now it is his and that it must be left a secret. Ben reveals that he has been in the secret garden before by climbing over the wall, which explains how the roses in the garden look pruned. As the sun goes down, Ben Weatherstaff presents Colin with a potted rose, which Colin plants in the soil himself. When Colin returns for the night, Dr. Craven warns him to minimize his time spent outside, and Colin responds defiantly that he will be going out every day and that he can't be stopped. Mary notices Colin's rude way of ordering around people and tells him directly that he could have better manners. Colin is surprised to hear that he behaves in this strange way, but he vows to keep visiting the garden, where he will be transformed by Magic. In the following months, many magical things take place in the garden as the flowers start budding. Colin continues to spend time there every day, watching things grow. Colin believes that it is the Magic that allowed him to stand for the first time in the garden. One day, Colin calls over Ben Weatherstaff, Mary, and Dickon to declare that when he grows up he will be a scientist who studies Magic. He proposes they do an experiment where every day they each affirm that Magic is inside of them and is making them well and to observe the results. They then sit cross-legged in a circle under the tree to start the experiment. Colin repeats a chant about how Magic lives through all of life, including in them. They then form a procession through the garden where Colin continues to declare that Magic is making him strong. He has made himself believe that he is not sick anymore and imagines what his father would think when he sees him well. The children continue to do these ceremonies regularly. Dickon starts working at another garden near his cottage. His mother, Mrs. Sowerby, enjoys going out to this garden and talking to the boy. There, Dickon divulges to her all the things that have been happening at Misselthwaite Manor and she becomes in on the secret. Mrs. Sowerby offers to prepare the children milk and bread to enjoy during their days in the garden, in order to help Colin and Mary fatten up. Dr. Craven and the nurses are beginning to notice Colin's increased appetite, so he can't ask for more food. He tries to not make himself seem too healthy, as he doesn't want anyone to find out about the secret garden and interfere with the children's daily routine. When the doctor proposes writing to Colin's father to tell him of his improving health, Colin panics and considers he might have to start eating less in order to discourage Dr. Craven. Mary and Colin find it difficult to eat less, however, because their appetites are growing each day. Thus they are delighted to receive the food from Mrs. Sowerby. Not wanting to put too much pressure on Dickon's mother to feed them, they also create a tiny oven in a hollow near the garden, in which the children cook potatoes and eggs. Becoming stronger, Colin is able to stand and walk more and more. The manor staff are perplexed at how the children can grow so strong and look so healthy while eating so little. The garden is blooming more and more and the robins are hatching eggs, which is described as a miracle. The robin's perspective is given, where he reveals that he trusts Dickon around the eggs but not necessarily Colin and Mary. The robins observe Colin learning to walk and conclude that the boy is learning to fly. On a rainy day, Mary and Colin amuse themselves by exploring the unused rooms in the mansion. Their playing causes them to have a great appetite and they both finish their lunches for the first time in awhile, much to the happiness of the staff. Later, Mary notices that Colin has removed the curtain from his mother's portrait in his room. Colin continues to lecture the children and Ben Weatherstaff about Magic, even while they are at work weeding in the garden. One day, Ben suggests Dickon sing the \"Doxology,\" a hymn which praises God and all His creatures. As the children sing the hymn, a woman with affectionate eyes and a long blue cloak enters. It is Dickon's mother. She is surprised and happy to see Colin so well. She is also shocked because of the uncanny resemblance Colin bears to his own mother. She also notices how much Mary has grown healthier. The children ask her if she believes in Magic, to which she says yes, calling it the \"Big Good Thing\" in which they must always put their faith. The last chapter starts with narration about how the power of thoughts will be discovered and better understood in the 20th century. For instance, a bad thought can negatively affect the body just as much as a disease. This is shown through the characters of Mary and Colin. The narrator speaks of Mr. Craven, who for 10 years has thought only negatively and has not had the courage to be more positive, even while traveling throughout beautiful places in Europe. One day, while sitting by a stream in Austria, he starts thinking of the site's beauty and he suddenly feels alive for the first time in years. He can't maintain this new hope all the time, but he feels over the next few days that his usual sense of burden periodically lifts. One night, Mr. Craven dreams of hearing Mrs. Craven's voice calling to him, telling him that she is in their special garden. The next day, he receives a letter from Mrs. Sowerby advising him to come home, and that Mrs. Craven would want him to come if she were alive. Mr. Craven makes the journey back, thinking of Colin in a way he hasn't in years. He reflects on how he has not been the best father to Colin, avoiding him because of his resemblance to his wife. As he arrives back at the manor, he thinks about how he will find the key to the secret garden. Mrs. Medlock updates Mr. Craven on Colin's new behaviors and habit of going outdoors every single day. Mr. Craven hurriedly goes to the secret garden. Outside its walls he is surprised to hear commotion and laughter of children. All of a sudden, Colin bursts out of the garden door and bumps directly into his father. Mr. Craven is astonished yet happy to see Colin standing, looking healthy and vibrant. Colin takes him into the garden and tells him everything: about the Magic, the creatures, and his new friends. Mr. Craven laughs and cries with joy at hearing his son's story. The manor servants are completely shocked when they see out the window a healthy-looking Colin and his father walking together towards the house."}

Both Mary and Colin began to improve when their selfish, dark thoughts were replaced with positive thinking. Meanwhile, as these two have been improving their minds in the Secret Garden, Mr. Craven has been wandering around Europe. He has seen many beautiful places, but none of these regions have made any difference to his deep sadness. Yet suddenly--at just the same time that Colin is shouting, \\\"I am going to live forever and ever and ever!\\\" back in the Secret Garden--Mr. Craven begins to feel some burden lifting from him. One night, as he is dreaming, he hears the voice of his wife calling him from the garden. That day, he gets a letter from Mrs. Sowerby saying that his wife would want to come home. So Mr. Craven travels back to Misselthwaite Manor right away. All of this time, Mr. Craven has been thinking that Colin is basically a vicious brat, \\\"so like and yet so horribly unlike\\\" his dead wife. When he arrives at the Manor, he sends for Mrs. Medlock and asks how Colin is. Mrs. Medlock's report is so confused that Mr. Craven thinks Colin has become worse.

He hears the sound of running feet and laughing children, and he thinks that he is in a dream as a tall boy runs through the door of the \\\"locked\\\" garden. Of course, it's Colin--he's just beaten Mary in a race. Colin leads Mr. Craven into the Secret Garden and tells his father everything that's been happening. And as Mr. Craven and Colin walk back to the house, Colin finally gives up his wheelchair to show that he can walk as well as any kid in Yorkshire.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"\nIn each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have\nbeen discovered.  In the last century more amazing things were found\nout than in any century before.  In this new century hundreds of things\nstill more astounding will be brought to light.  At first people refuse\nto believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to\nhope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and\nall the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.  One of the\nnew things people began to find out in the last century was that\nthoughts--just mere thoughts--are as powerful as electric batteries--as\ngood for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.  To let a sad\nthought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a\nscarlet fever germ get into your body.  If you let it stay there after\nit has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.\n\nSo long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about\nher dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to\nbe pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced,\nsickly, bored and wretched child.  Circumstances, however, were very\nkind to her, though she was not at all aware of it.  They began to push\nher about for her own good.  When her mind gradually filled itself with\nrobins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed\nold gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime\nand with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor\nboy and his \"creatures,\" there was no room left for the disagreeable\nthoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow\nand tired.\n\nSo long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his\nfears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and\nreflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical\nhalf-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and\nthe spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand\nupon his feet if he tried to do it.  When new beautiful thoughts began\nto push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his\nblood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like\na flood.  His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and\nthere was nothing weird about it at all.  Much more surprising things\ncan happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought\ncomes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it\nout by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.  Two things\ncannot be in one place.\n\n         \"Where, you tend a rose, my lad,\n         A thistle cannot grow.\"\n\nWhile the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming\nalive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away\nbeautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains\nof Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind\nfilled with dark and heart-broken thinking.  He had not been\ncourageous; he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place\nof the dark ones.  He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he\nhad lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming\nall about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought\nthem.  A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and\nhe had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused\nobstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.  He had\nforgotten and deserted his home and his duties.  When he traveled\nabout, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong\ndone to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him\nwith gloom.  Most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man\nwith some hidden crime on his soul.  He, was a tall man with a drawn\nface and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel\nregisters was, \"Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire,\nEngland.\"\n\nHe had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his\nstudy and told her she might have her \"bit of earth.\" He had been in\nthe most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere\nmore than a few days.  He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots.\nHe had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and\nhad looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them\nwith such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.\n\nBut the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he\nrealized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had\nhappened.  He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he\nhad been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any\nman's soul out of shadow.  He had walked a long way and it had not\nlifted his.  But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down\nto rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.  It was a clear little stream\nwhich ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious\ndamp greenness.  Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low\nlaughter as it bubbled over and round stones.  He saw birds come and\ndip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away.\nIt seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness\nseem deeper.  The valley was very, very still.\n\nAs he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven\ngradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the\nvalley itself.  He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.\nHe sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things\ngrowing at its edge.  There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots\ngrowing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he\nfound himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things\nyears ago.  He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and\nwhat wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.  He did not\nknow that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind--filling\nand filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.  It was as\nif a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had\nrisen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away.  But of\ncourse he did not think of this himself.  He only knew that the valley\nseemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright\ndelicate blueness.  He did not know how long he sat there or what was\nhappening to him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he\ngot up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft\nbreath and wondering at himself.  Something seemed to have been unbound\nand released in him, very quietly.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand over\nhis forehead.  \"I almost feel as if--I were alive!\"\n\nI do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to\nbe able to explain how this had happened to him.  Neither does any one\nelse yet.  He did not understand at all himself--but he remembered this\nstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he\nfound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out\nas he went into the secret garden:\n\n\"I am going to live forever and ever and ever!\"\n\nThe singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he\nslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long.  He did\nnot know that it could be kept.  By the next night he had opened the\ndoors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing\nback.  He left the valley and went on his wandering way again.  But,\nstrange as it seemed to him, there were minutes--sometimes\nhalf-hours--when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to\nlift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.\nSlowly--slowly--for no reason that he knew of--he was \"coming alive\"\nwith the garden.\n\nAs the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the\nLake of Como.  There he found the loveliness of a dream.  He spent his\ndays upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the\nsoft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that\nhe might sleep.  But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he\nknew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he thought, \"my body is growing stronger.\"\n\nIt was growing stronger but--because of the rare peaceful hours when\nhis thoughts were changed--his soul was slowly growing stronger, too.\nHe began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.\nNow and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what\nhe should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed\nagain and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it\nslept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.\nHe shrank from it.\n\nOne marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon\nwas high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver.  The\nstillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not\ngo into the villa he lived in.  He walked down to a little bowered\nterrace at the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the\nheavenly scents of the night.  He felt the strange calmness stealing\nover him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.\n\nHe did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his\ndream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming.  He\nremembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought\nhe was.  He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the\nlate roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he\nheard a voice calling.  It was sweet and clear and happy and far away.\nIt seemed very far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at\nhis very side.\n\n\"Archie! Archie! Archie!\" it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer\nthan before, \"Archie! Archie!\"\n\nHe thought he sprang to his feet not even startled.  It was such a real\nvoice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.\n\n\"Lilias! Lilias!\" he answered.  \"Lilias! where are you?\"\n\n\"In the garden,\" it came back like a sound from a golden flute.  \"In\nthe garden!\"\n\nAnd then the dream ended.  But he did not awaken.  He slept soundly and\nsweetly all through the lovely night.  When he did awake at last it was\nbrilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him.  He was an\nItalian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa\nwere, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign\nmaster might do.  No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or\nwhere he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or\nlie in the boat on the lake all night.  The man held a salver with some\nletters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them.  When\nhe had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand\nand looking at the lake.  His strange calm was still upon him and\nsomething more--a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done\nhad not happened as he thought--as if something had changed.  He was\nremembering the dream--the real--real dream.\n\n\"In the garden!\" he said, wondering at himself.  \"In the garden! But\nthe door is locked and the key is buried deep.\"\n\nWhen he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one\nlying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from\nYorkshire.  It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a\nhand he knew.  He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the\nfirst words attracted his attention at once.\n\n\n\"Dear Sir:\n\nI am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor.  It\nwas about Miss Mary I spoke.  I will make bold to speak again.  Please,\nsir, I would come home if I was you.  I think you would be glad to come\nand--if you will excuse me, sir--I think your lady would ask you to\ncome if she was here.\n\n                      Your obedient servant,\n                      Susan Sowerby.\"\n\n\nMr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.\nHe kept thinking about the dream.\n\n\"I will go back to Misselthwaite,\" he said.  \"Yes, I'll go at once.\"\n\nAnd he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to\nprepare for his return to England.\n\n\nIn a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad\njourney he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in\nall the ten years past.  During those years he had only wished to\nforget him.  Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories\nof him constantly drifted into his mind.  He remembered the black days\nwhen he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the\nmother was dead.  He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to\nlook at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that\neveryone had been sure it would die in a few days.  But to the surprise\nof those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then\neveryone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.\n\nHe had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father\nat all.  He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had\nshrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his\nown misery.  The first time after a year's absence he returned to\nMisselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and\nindifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes\nround them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had\nadored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as\ndeath.  After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,\nand all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a\nvicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.  He could only be kept from\nfuries dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.\n\nAll this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled\nhim through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was \"coming\nalive\" began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and\ndeeply.\n\n\"Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,\" he said to himself.\n\"Ten years is a long time.  It may be too late to do anything--quite\ntoo late.  What have I been thinking of!\"\n\nOf course this was the wrong Magic--to begin by saying \"too late.\" Even\nColin could have told him that.  But he knew nothing of Magic--either\nblack or white.  This he had yet to learn.  He wondered if Susan\nSowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly\ncreature had realized that the boy was much worse--was fatally ill.  If\nhe had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken\npossession of him he would have been more wretched than ever.  But the\ncalm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.  Instead of giving\nway to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe\nin better things.\n\n\"Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him good\nand control him?\" he thought.  \"I will go and see her on my way to\nMisselthwaite.\"\n\nBut when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the\ncottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a\ngroup and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him\nthat their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the\nmorning to help a woman who had a new baby.  \"Our Dickon,\" they\nvolunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where\nhe went several days each week.\n\nMr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round\nred-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he\nawoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot.  He smiled at\ntheir friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and\ngave it to \"our 'Lizabeth Ellen\" who was the oldest.\n\n\"If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for\neach of, you,\" he said.\n\nThen amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away,\nleaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.\n\nThe drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.\nWhy did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been\nsure he could never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and\nsky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing,\nnearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six\nhundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering\nto think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed\nwith the brocaded hangings.  Was it possible that perhaps he might find\nhim changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his\nshrinking from him?  How real that dream had been--how wonderful and\nclear the voice which called back to him, \"In the garden--In the\ngarden!\"\n\n\"I will try to find the key,\" he said.  \"I will try to open the door.\nI must--though I don't know why.\"\n\nWhen he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the\nusual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to\nthe remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher.  He went\ninto the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock.  She came to him somewhat\nexcited and curious and flustered.\n\n\"How is Master Colin, Medlock?\" he inquired.  \"Well, sir,\" Mrs. Medlock\nanswered, \"he's--he's different, in a manner of speaking.\"\n\n\"Worse?\" he suggested.\n\nMrs. Medlock really was flushed.\n\n\"Well, you see, sir,\" she tried to explain, \"neither Dr. Craven, nor\nthe nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might be\nchanging for the worse.  His appetite, sir, is past understanding--and\nhis ways--\"\n\n\"Has he become more--more peculiar?\" her master, asked, knitting his\nbrows anxiously.\n\n\"That's it, sir.  He's growing very peculiar--when you compare him with\nwhat he used to be.  He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began\nto eat something enormous--and then he stopped again all at once and\nthe meals were sent back just as they used to be.  You never knew, sir,\nperhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken.  The\nthings we've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave\na body trembling like a leaf.  He'd throw himself into such a state\nthat Dr. Craven said he couldn't be responsible for forcing him.  Well,\nsir, just without warning--not long after one of his worst tantrums he\nsuddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan\nSowerby's boy Dickon that could push his chair.  He took a fancy to\nboth Miss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if\nyou'll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until\nnight.\"\n\n\"How does he look?\" was the next question.\n\n\"If he took his food natural, sir, you'd think he was putting on\nflesh--but we're afraid it may be a sort of bloat.  He laughs sometimes\nin a queer way when he's alone with Miss Mary.  He never used to laugh\nat all.  Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you'll allow him.\nHe never was as puzzled in his life.\"\n\n\"Where is Master Colin now?\" Mr. Craven asked.\n\n\"In the garden, sir.  He's always in the garden--though not a human\ncreature is allowed to go near for fear they'll look at him.\"\n\nMr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.\n\n\"In the garden,\" he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he\nstood and repeated it again and again.  \"In the garden!\"\n\nHe had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was\nstanding in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went\nout of the room.  He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door\nin the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.  The\nfountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn\nflowers.  He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the\nivied walls.  He did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on\nthe path.  He felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had\nso long forsaken, and he did not know why.  As he drew near to it his\nstep became still more slow.  He knew where the door was even though\nthe ivy hung thick over it--but he did not know exactly where it\nlay--that buried key.\n\nSo he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment\nafter he had paused he started and listened--asking himself if he were\nwalking in a dream.\n\nThe ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs,\nno human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years--and yet\ninside the garden there were sounds.  They were the sounds of running\nscuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they\nwere strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices--exclamations and\nsmothered joyous cries.  It seemed actually like the laughter of young\nthings, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to\nbe heard but who in a moment or so--as their excitement mounted--would\nburst forth.  What in heaven's name was he dreaming of--what in\nheaven's name did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he\nheard things which were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear\nvoice had meant?\n\nAnd then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds\nforgot to hush themselves.  The feet ran faster and faster--they were\nnearing the garden door--there was quick strong young breathing and a\nwild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained--and the\ndoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back,\nand a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the\noutsider, dashed almost into his arms.\n\nMr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a\nresult of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to\nlook at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.\n\nHe was a tall boy and a handsome one.  He was glowing with life and his\nrunning had sent splendid color leaping to his face.  He threw the\nthick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray\neyes--eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a\nfringe.  It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.\n\"Who--What? Who!\" he stammered.\n\nThis was not what Colin had expected--this was not what he had planned.\nHe had never thought of such a meeting.  And yet to come dashing\nout--winning a race--perhaps it was even better.  He drew himself up to\nhis very tallest.  Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed\nthrough the door too, believed that he managed to make himself look\ntaller than he had ever looked before--inches taller.\n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"I'm Colin.  You can't believe it.  I scarcely can\nmyself.  I'm Colin.\"\n\nLike Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he\nsaid hurriedly:\n\n\"In the garden! In the garden!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" hurried on Colin.  \"It was the garden that did it--and Mary and\nDickon and the creatures--and the Magic.  No one knows.  We kept it to\ntell you when you came.  I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race.  I'm\ngoing to be an athlete.\"\n\nHe said it all so like a healthy boy--his face flushed, his words\ntumbling over each other in his eagerness--that Mr. Craven's soul shook\nwith unbelieving joy.\n\nColin put out his hand and laid it on his father's arm.\n\n\"Aren't you glad, Father?\" he ended.  \"Aren't you glad?  I'm going to\nlive forever and ever and ever!\"\n\nMr. Craven put his hands on both the boy's shoulders and held him\nstill.  He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.\n\n\"Take me into the garden, my boy,\" he said at last.  \"And tell me all\nabout it.\"\n\nAnd so they led him in.\n\nThe place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue\nand flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies\nstanding together--lilies which were white or white and ruby.  He\nremembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at\nthis season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.\nLate roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening\nthe hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an\nembowered temple of gold.  The newcomer stood silent just as the\nchildren had done when they came into its grayness.  He looked round\nand round.\n\n\"I thought it would be dead,\" he said.\n\n\"Mary thought so at first,\" said Colin.  \"But it came alive.\"\n\nThen they sat down under their tree--all but Colin, who wanted to stand\nwhile he told the story.\n\nIt was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought,\nas it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.  Mystery and Magic and\nwild creatures, the weird midnight meeting--the coming of the\nspring--the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah\nto his feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face.  The odd\ncompanionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept.\nThe listener laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears\ncame into his eyes when he was not laughing.  The Athlete, the\nLecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy\nyoung human thing.\n\n\"Now,\" he said at the end of the story, \"it need not be a secret any\nmore.  I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see\nme--but I am never going to get into the chair again.  I shall walk\nback with you, Father--to the house.\"\n\n\nBen Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on\nthis occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen\nand being invited into the servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a\nglass of beer he was on the spot--as he had hoped to be--when the most\ndramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present\ngeneration actually took place.  One of the windows looking upon the\ncourtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.  Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben\nhad come from the gardens, hoped that he might have caught sight of his\nmaster and even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin.\n\n\"Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?\" she asked.\n\nBen took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back\nof his hand.\n\n\"Aye, that I did,\" he answered with a shrewdly significant air.\n\n\"Both of them?\" suggested Mrs. Medlock.\n\n\"Both of 'em,\" returned Ben Weatherstaff.  \"Thank ye kindly, ma'am, I\ncould sup up another mug of it.\"\n\n\"Together?\" said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her\nexcitement.\n\n\"Together, ma'am,\" and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.\n\n\"Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to each\nother?\"\n\n\"I didna' hear that,\" said Ben, \"along o' only bein' on th' stepladder\nlookin, over th' wall.  But I'll tell thee this.  There's been things\ngoin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about.  An' what tha'll\nfind out tha'll find out soon.\"\n\nAnd it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and\nwaved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the\nshrubbery a piece of the lawn.\n\n\"Look there,\" he said, \"if tha's curious.  Look what's comin' across\nth' grass.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little\nshriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the\nservants' hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes\nalmost starting out of their heads.\n\nAcross the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many\nof them had never seen him.  And by his, side with his head up in the\nair and his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as\nany boy in Yorkshire--Master Colin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":4882.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 27","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210125021046\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/the-secret-garden\/summary\/chapter-27","summary_text":"The narrator jumps in to tell us that thoughts have a huge amount of power--let a bad thought get stuck in your head, and it's as dangerous as poison.

Colin has never actually been to church, since he's been too sick, so Dickon does the singing. And Colin decides that his Magic and the God of the Doxology might be the same thing. As they are finishing up their singing, a woman walks into the garden: Mrs. Sowerby, Dickon's mother. As soon as Mrs. Sowerby sees Colin, she tells him that he is just like his mother, and that Mr. Craven has to come home right away to see. She also admires Mary, who is growing into a pretty girl.

The narrator also says that only the courageous are able to do this; Master Craven, by contrast, has not been courageous&mdashhis mind is still full of his grief. The narrator finds Master Craven in the Austrian Tyrol, having \\\"forgotten and deserted his home and his duties.\\\" At first, the natural landscape does nothing to soothe his anguish. Then his eye comes to rest on a cluster of flowers&mdashforget-me-nots&mdashand he finds himself marveling at their beauty.

His body and soul begin to become still stronger during his time in Italy, at Lake Como, where he goes after his departure from Austria. One night, he dreams of the Mistress Craven; she is calling his name and asking him to come find her in their garden. The next morning, he receives a letter from Susan Sowerby, advising him to come back to Misselthwaite at once: he must see Colin, she says, as his late wife would want him to. She does not explain why. Archibald immediately makes preparations to return home by rail. On the journey to England, Master Craven muses about his son and his history: he thinks of the way he has neglected Colin, for he has never felt at all like the father of such an hysteric. He thinks of the way Colin's eyes&mdashso like and yet so horribly unlike his mother's&mdashfill him with aversion. And yet, he remains serene, and resolves to at least try to rectify his relationship with his son upon his return. Master Craven is much pleased by his return to moor, and stops at Susan Sowerby's house to make a tiny gift to her children. At the manor, he immediately sets off for the garden to look for his son, as Mrs. Medlock says that he will find Colin there. He is astonished to hear sounds of children running and laughing, coming from beyond the secret garden's wall. Suddenly, the door is flung open, and Colin tumbles out into his father's arms. Master Craven, ecstatic to find him healthy, embraces Colin, and asks his son to show him around the secret garden. Colin does so, and tells him the entire story of its discovery and its reawakening. The three of them&mdashColin, Mary, and Master Craven&mdashwalk back to the manor house. Each and every person is utterly astounded by Archibald's happiness and Colin's vigor, now that it is no longer a secret.\", \"analysis\": \"This chapter marks the lengthiest of the narrator's intervention into the text. It serves a primarily didactic  function, in that it provides a kind of abstract of Colin and Mary's transformations, and of the book's major theme: the idea, taken from Christian Science, that thoughts alone are enough to determine one's health and well-being. The 19th century person who made this \\\"discovery\\\" is Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science. Baker Eddy's magnum opus, Science and Health, is to Christian Scientists what the Bible is to conventional Christians, or what Dianetics is to Scientologists. This chapter also marks the second time that the narrator does not present events in a straightforward chronological fashion: the other instance is at the beginning of the novel, in which she retrospectively looks at Mary's time in India from the point of view of Misselthwaite. The narrator traces Archibald Craven's travels, which occur at the same time as the events that make up the bulk of the novel. His travels demonstrate his extreme estrangement from that process of rebirth, even as it affects him: he begins to feel alive as the garden is brought back to life. The reader thereby realizes that the garden is as closely connected to his spirit as it is to his late wife's, although for a different reason. For him, its resurrection is his because it is, in some sense, what remains of his wife on earth. Susan Sowerby's summoning of Master Craven back to the manor is significant for several reasons. On the one hand, it indicates how thoroughly she has adopted Colin's cause; on the other, it puts her in the position of speaking for Mistress Craven, with whom she seems to have unusual sympathy. In the previous chapter she bends to kiss the garden's flowers, just as Mistress Craven used to. Furthermore, it indicates that she, like her son, is above the absurd indignities of class disparity: she writes to Master Craven despite the fact that he is \\\"above her station\\\" because she is, in reality, finer than he is&mdashand they both are aware of it. Archibald's dream of his wife brings him back to the garden. The dream is also, implicitly, a dream of his son: he ardently embraces Colin, in large part, because his eyes are now so like his mother's. This reader could not help but be made uncomfortable by how easily Master Craven was forgiven for his gross neglect of his son; though this is, of course, a dilemma each reader must resolve for himself. At novel's end, all of the secrets are out: that of the garden, of Mary's improvement, and of Colin's. Since secrets are the novel's animating force, it is entirely in keeping with the logic of the narrative that the story should end here.\"}","chapter":"\nIn each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have\nbeen discovered.  In the last century more amazing things were found\nout than in any century before.  In this new century hundreds of things\nstill more astounding will be brought to light.  At first people refuse\nto believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to\nhope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and\nall the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.  One of the\nnew things people began to find out in the last century was that\nthoughts--just mere thoughts--are as powerful as electric batteries--as\ngood for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.  To let a sad\nthought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a\nscarlet fever germ get into your body.  If you let it stay there after\nit has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.\n\nSo long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about\nher dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to\nbe pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced,\nsickly, bored and wretched child.  Circumstances, however, were very\nkind to her, though she was not at all aware of it.  They began to push\nher about for her own good.  When her mind gradually filled itself with\nrobins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed\nold gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime\nand with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor\nboy and his \"creatures,\" there was no room left for the disagreeable\nthoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow\nand tired.\n\nSo long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his\nfears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and\nreflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical\nhalf-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and\nthe spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand\nupon his feet if he tried to do it.  When new beautiful thoughts began\nto push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his\nblood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like\na flood.  His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and\nthere was nothing weird about it at all.  Much more surprising things\ncan happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought\ncomes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it\nout by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.  Two things\ncannot be in one place.\n\n         \"Where, you tend a rose, my lad,\n         A thistle cannot grow.\"\n\nWhile the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming\nalive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away\nbeautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains\nof Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind\nfilled with dark and heart-broken thinking.  He had not been\ncourageous; he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place\nof the dark ones.  He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he\nhad lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming\nall about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought\nthem.  A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and\nhe had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused\nobstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.  He had\nforgotten and deserted his home and his duties.  When he traveled\nabout, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong\ndone to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him\nwith gloom.  Most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man\nwith some hidden crime on his soul.  He, was a tall man with a drawn\nface and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel\nregisters was, \"Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire,\nEngland.\"\n\nHe had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his\nstudy and told her she might have her \"bit of earth.\" He had been in\nthe most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere\nmore than a few days.  He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots.\nHe had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and\nhad looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them\nwith such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.\n\nBut the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he\nrealized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had\nhappened.  He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he\nhad been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any\nman's soul out of shadow.  He had walked a long way and it had not\nlifted his.  But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down\nto rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.  It was a clear little stream\nwhich ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious\ndamp greenness.  Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low\nlaughter as it bubbled over and round stones.  He saw birds come and\ndip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away.\nIt seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness\nseem deeper.  The valley was very, very still.\n\nAs he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven\ngradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the\nvalley itself.  He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.\nHe sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things\ngrowing at its edge.  There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots\ngrowing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he\nfound himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things\nyears ago.  He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and\nwhat wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.  He did not\nknow that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind--filling\nand filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.  It was as\nif a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had\nrisen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away.  But of\ncourse he did not think of this himself.  He only knew that the valley\nseemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright\ndelicate blueness.  He did not know how long he sat there or what was\nhappening to him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he\ngot up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft\nbreath and wondering at himself.  Something seemed to have been unbound\nand released in him, very quietly.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand over\nhis forehead.  \"I almost feel as if--I were alive!\"\n\nI do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to\nbe able to explain how this had happened to him.  Neither does any one\nelse yet.  He did not understand at all himself--but he remembered this\nstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he\nfound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out\nas he went into the secret garden:\n\n\"I am going to live forever and ever and ever!\"\n\nThe singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he\nslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long.  He did\nnot know that it could be kept.  By the next night he had opened the\ndoors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing\nback.  He left the valley and went on his wandering way again.  But,\nstrange as it seemed to him, there were minutes--sometimes\nhalf-hours--when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to\nlift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.\nSlowly--slowly--for no reason that he knew of--he was \"coming alive\"\nwith the garden.\n\nAs the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the\nLake of Como.  There he found the loveliness of a dream.  He spent his\ndays upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the\nsoft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that\nhe might sleep.  But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he\nknew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he thought, \"my body is growing stronger.\"\n\nIt was growing stronger but--because of the rare peaceful hours when\nhis thoughts were changed--his soul was slowly growing stronger, too.\nHe began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.\nNow and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what\nhe should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed\nagain and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it\nslept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.\nHe shrank from it.\n\nOne marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon\nwas high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver.  The\nstillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not\ngo into the villa he lived in.  He walked down to a little bowered\nterrace at the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the\nheavenly scents of the night.  He felt the strange calmness stealing\nover him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.\n\nHe did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his\ndream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming.  He\nremembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought\nhe was.  He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the\nlate roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he\nheard a voice calling.  It was sweet and clear and happy and far away.\nIt seemed very far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at\nhis very side.\n\n\"Archie! Archie! Archie!\" it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer\nthan before, \"Archie! Archie!\"\n\nHe thought he sprang to his feet not even startled.  It was such a real\nvoice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.\n\n\"Lilias! Lilias!\" he answered.  \"Lilias! where are you?\"\n\n\"In the garden,\" it came back like a sound from a golden flute.  \"In\nthe garden!\"\n\nAnd then the dream ended.  But he did not awaken.  He slept soundly and\nsweetly all through the lovely night.  When he did awake at last it was\nbrilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him.  He was an\nItalian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa\nwere, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign\nmaster might do.  No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or\nwhere he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or\nlie in the boat on the lake all night.  The man held a salver with some\nletters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them.  When\nhe had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand\nand looking at the lake.  His strange calm was still upon him and\nsomething more--a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done\nhad not happened as he thought--as if something had changed.  He was\nremembering the dream--the real--real dream.\n\n\"In the garden!\" he said, wondering at himself.  \"In the garden! But\nthe door is locked and the key is buried deep.\"\n\nWhen he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one\nlying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from\nYorkshire.  It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a\nhand he knew.  He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the\nfirst words attracted his attention at once.\n\n\n\"Dear Sir:\n\nI am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor.  It\nwas about Miss Mary I spoke.  I will make bold to speak again.  Please,\nsir, I would come home if I was you.  I think you would be glad to come\nand--if you will excuse me, sir--I think your lady would ask you to\ncome if she was here.\n\n                      Your obedient servant,\n                      Susan Sowerby.\"\n\n\nMr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.\nHe kept thinking about the dream.\n\n\"I will go back to Misselthwaite,\" he said.  \"Yes, I'll go at once.\"\n\nAnd he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to\nprepare for his return to England.\n\n\nIn a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad\njourney he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in\nall the ten years past.  During those years he had only wished to\nforget him.  Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories\nof him constantly drifted into his mind.  He remembered the black days\nwhen he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the\nmother was dead.  He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to\nlook at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that\neveryone had been sure it would die in a few days.  But to the surprise\nof those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then\neveryone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.\n\nHe had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father\nat all.  He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had\nshrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his\nown misery.  The first time after a year's absence he returned to\nMisselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and\nindifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes\nround them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had\nadored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as\ndeath.  After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,\nand all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a\nvicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.  He could only be kept from\nfuries dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.\n\nAll this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled\nhim through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was \"coming\nalive\" began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and\ndeeply.\n\n\"Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,\" he said to himself.\n\"Ten years is a long time.  It may be too late to do anything--quite\ntoo late.  What have I been thinking of!\"\n\nOf course this was the wrong Magic--to begin by saying \"too late.\" Even\nColin could have told him that.  But he knew nothing of Magic--either\nblack or white.  This he had yet to learn.  He wondered if Susan\nSowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly\ncreature had realized that the boy was much worse--was fatally ill.  If\nhe had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken\npossession of him he would have been more wretched than ever.  But the\ncalm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.  Instead of giving\nway to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe\nin better things.\n\n\"Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him good\nand control him?\" he thought.  \"I will go and see her on my way to\nMisselthwaite.\"\n\nBut when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the\ncottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a\ngroup and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him\nthat their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the\nmorning to help a woman who had a new baby.  \"Our Dickon,\" they\nvolunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where\nhe went several days each week.\n\nMr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round\nred-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he\nawoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot.  He smiled at\ntheir friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and\ngave it to \"our 'Lizabeth Ellen\" who was the oldest.\n\n\"If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for\neach of, you,\" he said.\n\nThen amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away,\nleaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.\n\nThe drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.\nWhy did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been\nsure he could never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and\nsky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing,\nnearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six\nhundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering\nto think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed\nwith the brocaded hangings.  Was it possible that perhaps he might find\nhim changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his\nshrinking from him?  How real that dream had been--how wonderful and\nclear the voice which called back to him, \"In the garden--In the\ngarden!\"\n\n\"I will try to find the key,\" he said.  \"I will try to open the door.\nI must--though I don't know why.\"\n\nWhen he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the\nusual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to\nthe remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher.  He went\ninto the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock.  She came to him somewhat\nexcited and curious and flustered.\n\n\"How is Master Colin, Medlock?\" he inquired.  \"Well, sir,\" Mrs. Medlock\nanswered, \"he's--he's different, in a manner of speaking.\"\n\n\"Worse?\" he suggested.\n\nMrs. Medlock really was flushed.\n\n\"Well, you see, sir,\" she tried to explain, \"neither Dr. Craven, nor\nthe nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might be\nchanging for the worse.  His appetite, sir, is past understanding--and\nhis ways--\"\n\n\"Has he become more--more peculiar?\" her master, asked, knitting his\nbrows anxiously.\n\n\"That's it, sir.  He's growing very peculiar--when you compare him with\nwhat he used to be.  He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began\nto eat something enormous--and then he stopped again all at once and\nthe meals were sent back just as they used to be.  You never knew, sir,\nperhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken.  The\nthings we've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave\na body trembling like a leaf.  He'd throw himself into such a state\nthat Dr. Craven said he couldn't be responsible for forcing him.  Well,\nsir, just without warning--not long after one of his worst tantrums he\nsuddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan\nSowerby's boy Dickon that could push his chair.  He took a fancy to\nboth Miss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if\nyou'll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until\nnight.\"\n\n\"How does he look?\" was the next question.\n\n\"If he took his food natural, sir, you'd think he was putting on\nflesh--but we're afraid it may be a sort of bloat.  He laughs sometimes\nin a queer way when he's alone with Miss Mary.  He never used to laugh\nat all.  Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you'll allow him.\nHe never was as puzzled in his life.\"\n\n\"Where is Master Colin now?\" Mr. Craven asked.\n\n\"In the garden, sir.  He's always in the garden--though not a human\ncreature is allowed to go near for fear they'll look at him.\"\n\nMr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.\n\n\"In the garden,\" he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he\nstood and repeated it again and again.  \"In the garden!\"\n\nHe had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was\nstanding in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went\nout of the room.  He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door\nin the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.  The\nfountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn\nflowers.  He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the\nivied walls.  He did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on\nthe path.  He felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had\nso long forsaken, and he did not know why.  As he drew near to it his\nstep became still more slow.  He knew where the door was even though\nthe ivy hung thick over it--but he did not know exactly where it\nlay--that buried key.\n\nSo he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment\nafter he had paused he started and listened--asking himself if he were\nwalking in a dream.\n\nThe ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs,\nno human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years--and yet\ninside the garden there were sounds.  They were the sounds of running\nscuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they\nwere strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices--exclamations and\nsmothered joyous cries.  It seemed actually like the laughter of young\nthings, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to\nbe heard but who in a moment or so--as their excitement mounted--would\nburst forth.  What in heaven's name was he dreaming of--what in\nheaven's name did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he\nheard things which were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear\nvoice had meant?\n\nAnd then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds\nforgot to hush themselves.  The feet ran faster and faster--they were\nnearing the garden door--there was quick strong young breathing and a\nwild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained--and the\ndoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back,\nand a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the\noutsider, dashed almost into his arms.\n\nMr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a\nresult of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to\nlook at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.\n\nHe was a tall boy and a handsome one.  He was glowing with life and his\nrunning had sent splendid color leaping to his face.  He threw the\nthick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray\neyes--eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a\nfringe.  It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.\n\"Who--What? Who!\" he stammered.\n\nThis was not what Colin had expected--this was not what he had planned.\nHe had never thought of such a meeting.  And yet to come dashing\nout--winning a race--perhaps it was even better.  He drew himself up to\nhis very tallest.  Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed\nthrough the door too, believed that he managed to make himself look\ntaller than he had ever looked before--inches taller.\n\n\"Father,\" he said, \"I'm Colin.  You can't believe it.  I scarcely can\nmyself.  I'm Colin.\"\n\nLike Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he\nsaid hurriedly:\n\n\"In the garden! In the garden!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" hurried on Colin.  \"It was the garden that did it--and Mary and\nDickon and the creatures--and the Magic.  No one knows.  We kept it to\ntell you when you came.  I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race.  I'm\ngoing to be an athlete.\"\n\nHe said it all so like a healthy boy--his face flushed, his words\ntumbling over each other in his eagerness--that Mr. Craven's soul shook\nwith unbelieving joy.\n\nColin put out his hand and laid it on his father's arm.\n\n\"Aren't you glad, Father?\" he ended.  \"Aren't you glad?  I'm going to\nlive forever and ever and ever!\"\n\nMr. Craven put his hands on both the boy's shoulders and held him\nstill.  He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.\n\n\"Take me into the garden, my boy,\" he said at last.  \"And tell me all\nabout it.\"\n\nAnd so they led him in.\n\nThe place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue\nand flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies\nstanding together--lilies which were white or white and ruby.  He\nremembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at\nthis season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.\nLate roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening\nthe hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an\nembowered temple of gold.  The newcomer stood silent just as the\nchildren had done when they came into its grayness.  He looked round\nand round.\n\n\"I thought it would be dead,\" he said.\n\n\"Mary thought so at first,\" said Colin.  \"But it came alive.\"\n\nThen they sat down under their tree--all but Colin, who wanted to stand\nwhile he told the story.\n\nIt was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought,\nas it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion.  Mystery and Magic and\nwild creatures, the weird midnight meeting--the coming of the\nspring--the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah\nto his feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face.  The odd\ncompanionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept.\nThe listener laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears\ncame into his eyes when he was not laughing.  The Athlete, the\nLecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy\nyoung human thing.\n\n\"Now,\" he said at the end of the story, \"it need not be a secret any\nmore.  I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see\nme--but I am never going to get into the chair again.  I shall walk\nback with you, Father--to the house.\"\n\n\nBen Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on\nthis occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen\nand being invited into the servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a\nglass of beer he was on the spot--as he had hoped to be--when the most\ndramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present\ngeneration actually took place.  One of the windows looking upon the\ncourtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.  Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben\nhad come from the gardens, hoped that he might have caught sight of his\nmaster and even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin.\n\n\"Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?\" she asked.\n\nBen took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back\nof his hand.\n\n\"Aye, that I did,\" he answered with a shrewdly significant air.\n\n\"Both of them?\" suggested Mrs. Medlock.\n\n\"Both of 'em,\" returned Ben Weatherstaff.  \"Thank ye kindly, ma'am, I\ncould sup up another mug of it.\"\n\n\"Together?\" said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her\nexcitement.\n\n\"Together, ma'am,\" and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.\n\n\"Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to each\nother?\"\n\n\"I didna' hear that,\" said Ben, \"along o' only bein' on th' stepladder\nlookin, over th' wall.  But I'll tell thee this.  There's been things\ngoin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about.  An' what tha'll\nfind out tha'll find out soon.\"\n\nAnd it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and\nwaved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the\nshrubbery a piece of the lawn.\n\n\"Look there,\" he said, \"if tha's curious.  Look what's comin' across\nth' grass.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little\nshriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the\nservants' hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes\nalmost starting out of their heads.\n\nAcross the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many\nof them had never seen him.  And by his, side with his head up in the\nair and his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as\nany boy in Yorkshire--Master Colin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":4882.0,"summary_name":"Chapter XXVII","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210124225111\/https:\/\/www.sparknotes.com\/lit\/secretgarden\/section17\/","summary_text":"The omniscient narrator opens the chapter by musing on the wonder of human invention, and suggests that one of the most remarkable ones of the previous  century was the idea that \"thoughts...are as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.\" She then notes the way in which both Colin and Mary have changed their negative thoughts to positive ones, and have flourished as a result.

His body and soul begin to become still stronger during his time in Italy, at Lake Como, where he goes after his departure from Austria. One night, he dreams of the Mistress Craven; she is calling his name and asking him to come find her in their garden.

And yet, he remains serene, and resolves to at least try to rectify his relationship with his son upon his return. Master Craven is much pleased by his return to moor, and stops at Susan Sowerby's house to make a tiny gift to her children. At the manor, he immediately sets off for the garden to look for his son, as Mrs. Medlock says that he will find Colin there. He is astonished to hear sounds of children running and laughing, coming from beyond the secret garden's wall. Suddenly, the door is flung open, and Colin tumbles out into his father's arms. Master Craven, ecstatic to find him healthy, embraces Colin, and asks his son to show him around the secret garden. Colin does so, and tells him the entire story of its discovery and its reawakening.

Each and every person is utterly astounded by Archibald's happiness and Colin's vigor, now that it is no longer a secret.","summary_analysis":"This chapter marks the lengthiest of the narrator's intervention into the text. It serves a primarily didactic  function, in that it provides a kind of abstract of Colin and Mary's transformations, and of the book's major theme: the idea, taken from Christian Science, that thoughts alone are enough to determine one's health and well-being. The 19th century person who made this \"discovery\" is Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science. Baker Eddy's magnum opus, Science and Health, is to Christian Scientists what the Bible is to conventional Christians, or what Dianetics is to Scientologists. This chapter also marks the second time that the narrator does not present events in a straightforward chronological fashion: the other instance is at the beginning of the novel, in which she retrospectively looks at Mary's time in India from the point of view of Misselthwaite. The narrator traces Archibald Craven's travels, which occur at the same time as the events that make up the bulk of the novel. His travels demonstrate his extreme estrangement from that process of rebirth, even as it affects him: he begins to feel alive as the garden is brought back to life. The reader thereby realizes that the garden is as closely connected to his spirit as it is to his late wife's, although for a different reason. For him, its resurrection is his because it is, in some sense, what remains of his wife on earth. Susan Sowerby's summoning of Master Craven back to the manor is significant for several reasons. On the one hand, it indicates how thoroughly she has adopted Colin's cause; on the other, it puts her in the position of speaking for Mistress Craven, with whom she seems to have unusual sympathy. In the previous chapter she bends to kiss the garden's flowers, just as Mistress Craven used to. Furthermore, it indicates that she, like her son, is above the absurd indignities of class disparity: she writes to Master Craven despite the fact that he is \"above her station\" because she is, in reality, finer than he is&mdashand they both are aware of it. Archibald's dream of his wife brings him back to the garden. The dream is also, implicitly, a dream of his son: he ardently embraces Colin, in large part, because his eyes are now so like his mother's. This reader could not help but be made uncomfortable by how easily Master Craven was forgiven for his gross neglect of his son; though this is, of course, a dilemma each reader must resolve for himself. At novel's end, all of the secrets are out: that of the garden, of Mary's improvement, and of Colin's. Since secrets are the novel's animating force, it is entirely in keeping with the logic of the narrative that the story should end here.","summary_length":491.0,"analysis_length":467.0,"chap_int":27,"previous summary id":["chapter 26","chapter xxvi"],"previous chapter":["Colin has found a new hobby: He likes to lecture about the Magic to anyone who will listen . As Colin is weeding and working in the garden, he suddenly realizes that he is doing as good a job as Mary and Dickon. In fact, Colin has become completely well. He is so happy that he wants to sing--something. Ben Weatherstaff isn't religious, but he suggests the \"Doxology\" . Colin has never actually been to church, since he's been too sick, so Dickon does the singing. And Colin decides that his Magic and the God of the Doxology might be the same thing. As they are finishing up their singing, a woman walks into the garden: Mrs. Sowerby, Dickon's mother. As soon as Mrs. Sowerby sees Colin, she tells him that he is just like his mother, and that Mr. Craven has to come home right away to see. She also admires Mary, who is growing into a pretty girl. Mrs. Sowerby agrees that the Magic is just one name for what she calls \"the Good Thing\" . It doesn't matter what people call it, as long as they have faith. Mrs. Sowerby says they won't have to keep up this act of Colin's ill health for much longer--Mr. Craven will come home soon. As Colin is leaving that afternoon, he tells Mrs. Sowerby that he wishes she were his mother as well as Dickon's. Mrs. Sowerby is so moved that she promises Colin that his mother is in this garden with him--and, again, Mr. Craven will be home soon.","While Colin is lecturing in the garden, Ben Weatherstaff marvels at how strong he has become, and at how much he looks like his mother. Colin says that his experiment has succeeded, and that he intends to write a book about Magic quite soon. Suddenly overwhelmed by the miracle of his own health, he leaps up and shouts that he \"shall live forever and ever and ever. Ben Weatherstaff suggests that Colin sing the Doxology  to express his joy and thankfulness. Dickon tells them that he and his mother believe that the skylarks themselves sing this hymn, which runs: \"Praise God from whom all blessings flow, Praise Him all creatures here below, Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host, Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Colin immediately likes the song, and remarks that it means precisely what he does when he says that he is thankful to the Magic; perhaps God and Magic \"are the same thing. Suddenly, Mrs. Sowerby appears at the garden door, and Dickon immediately runs to her. She is a beautiful woman with gentle, all-encompassing eyes; she wears a long blue cloak that appears very picturesque in the dappled sunlight. She, too, is taken aback by how much Colin looks like his mother. Mrs. Sowerby is full of affection for him, and calls Colin \"lad\" as if he were her own child. She also embraces Mary, exclaims of her prettiness, and compares her to one of her own daughters. The children show Mrs. Sowerby every part of the secret garden; Colin and Mary are irresistibly drawn to the \"warm, supported feeling\" that she inspires in both of them. Colin asks her if she believes in Magic, and she ardently replies that she does, although she doesn't call it by that name. For Mrs. Sowerby, it does not matter what its proper name is: it is merely \"the Big Good Thing,\" the \"Joy Maker. The group vows to make a visit to the Sowerbys' cottage. Mrs. Sowerby says that Master Craven must come home soon, so that he might see the dramatic change in his son. Colin is very touched, and says that he wishes that she were his mother as well as Dickon's.

He thinks of the way Colin's eyes&mdashso like and yet so horribly unlike his mother's&mdashfill him with aversion. And yet, he remains serene, and resolves to at least try to rectify his relationship with his son upon his return. Master Craven is much pleased by his return to moor, and stops at Susan Sowerby's house to make a tiny gift to her children. At the manor, he immediately sets off for the garden to look for his son, as Mrs. Medlock says that he will find Colin there. He is astonished to hear sounds of children running and laughing, coming from beyond the secret garden's wall. Suddenly, the door is flung open, and Colin tumbles out into his father's arms. Master Craven, ecstatic to find him healthy, embraces Colin, and asks his son to show him around the secret garden. Colin does so, and tells him the entire story of its discovery and its reawakening. The three of them&mdashColin, Mary, and Master Craven&mdashwalk back to the manor house. Each and every person is utterly astounded by Archibald's happiness and Colin's vigor, now that it is no longer a secret."}

The men comment on Pegeen's infatuation with Christy, who has routed every competitor on the beach. Though they acknowledge his skill as an athlete, they are annoyed by his incessant bragging over his heroic deed. They then discuss a collection of skulls on display in Dublin. Old Mahon enters to hear their talk, and shows them his own skull injury. When he attributes it to his good-for-nothing son, the men grow suspicious and ask for more detail. Mahon promises to oblige if they feed him supper, and reveals that he has been earning bed and board in exchange for the story of his son's attack. Widow Quin enters to find them in conversation, and she quickly separates them from one another. After giving Old Mahon a drink, she confides to Jimmy and Philly that Mahon is raving. She tells them how he had initially attributed his head fracture to a tinker's blow, but has changed his story after hearing tell of Christy's deed. Meanwhile, Mahon grows maudlin, lamenting his son's betrayal. Finding him credible, Jimmy and Philly ask for more detail about the son. However, the widow slyly interjects by asking Mahon whether his son was a great athlete. Naturally, Mahon denies that claim, insisting the boy is a mangy cur. Suddenly, they hear the crowd roaring from the beach. Though the sound pierces Mahon's aching head, he is curious about the commotion, and joins Jimmy and Philly to watch a tremendously exciting mule race in the distance. They all exclaim over the skill of the race champion, and then note that the crowd is carrying him towards the pub. When he recognizes this champion as Christy, Mahon cries out in shock. The widow insists his perception has been obscured by his injury, since his son could never have achieved such a victory. Confused, Mahon concedes the point, and insists he must check himself into an insane asylum, admitting that he has spent time there in the past. He exits, followed by Jimmy and Philly, who remain suspicious of the widow's story. As he is carried in by the crowd, overcome with prizes, Christy boasts that his mule race victory is nothing compared to his heroic murder. Pegeen proudly tends to Christy as the crowd disperses to watch the final event down on the beach. Once they are alone, Christy declares his wish to wed Pegeen in a fortnight. Pegeen hedges, insinuating he is a skirt-chaser. He rejects this suggestion, wooing her poetically and tenderly in the process. She softens, speaking tenderly in turn. Finally, Pegeen consents to marriage, noting how fortunate it is that she already has a dress. Michael, still drunk, enters with Shawn. Death still on his mind from the wake, Michael chastises Christy for having deprived his father of a Christian burial. Shawn then announces that he has received Father Reilly's dispensation, and that Michael has consented to have him and Pegeen married today. Michael adds that he does not want to leave Pegeen alone any longer with a reprobate like Christy. Pegeen defies her father by declaring her plan to marry Christy. Horrified his daughter would prefer a father-killer to a decent Christian, Michael urges Shawn to challenge Christy. Shawn's cowardly refusal to stand up for himself only hardens Pegeen against him. Shawn does tries to argue his case, citing the ring he has already bought, the promise he has made to give the family heifers, and the church's permission, but Pegeen remains unmoved. Christy threatens to murder Shawn if he persists, and Michael grows incensed at the suggestion, adding that he cannot allow a murder in his pub, especially since he has stocked so much illegal moonshine for the night's celebration. He encourages the men to bring their battle down to the beach, but Shawn remains steadfast in his refusal to fight. Michael reassesses the situation: If the goal of marriage is to procreate, then better Pegeen should procreate with brave Christy than create any small replicas of the cowardly Shawn. Convinced, Michael gives his blessing to Pegeen and Christy by bringing their hands together. They hear a hubbub outside, and then Old Mahon bursts in, followed by the crowd and Widow Quin. Mahon rushes at Christy, who cowers before his father's blows. Pegeen intervenes in the fight, and Old Mahon reveals that he is Christy's father. Pegeen immediately renounces Christy, who desperately claims that Mahon is a lunatic, and turns to Widow Quin to validate the lie. But Widow Quin can no longer hide the truth, and the crowd roars with pleasure at seeing Christy's lie unravel. Christy begs mercy for a moment, but then, in a sudden and lyrical expression of his fate, he accepts his own lowliness. Unfit for happiness, he could never endure the terrible splendor of a girl like Pegeen. Covering her tears, Pegeen urges Mahon to take his son away before she sets the town's boys on him. Her manner is derisive and desperate. As Mahon struggles to drag Christy away, the crowd eggs on the fight, until Christy turns on them, brandishing a spade. They back away gingerly, jeering in amusement that Christy has gone mad. Mahon goads his son once again, and Christy chases him from the building, the spade raised high. Everyone rushes out, following Christy. Offstage, there is a great yell, followed be silence. A dazed Christy stumbles back in, followed by the Widow Quin, who warns that he must leave at once since the crowd has turned on him. However, Christy refuses, hoping that Pegeen will want him again now that he has truly killed his father. The widow counters that there are woman like Pegeen all over the country, but he is unmoved. Sara runs in and removes her petticoats, hoping Christy will wear them as a makeshift disguise. However, Christy threatens the two women with a stool, and the widow suggests they should fetch the doctor since the man has clearly gone mad. They leave him alone. From the doorway, Michael, Philly, Shawn and Pegeen strategize how to trap Christy in a loop of rope. A frightened Shawn refuses to participate, so the others enter together and land the rope around his arms. Caught, Christy asks Pegeen how she feels about him now that he has actually committed the parricide. Pegeen answers: \\\"I'll say, a strange man is a marvel, with his mighty talk; but what's a squabble in your back yard, and the blow of a loy, have taught me that there's a great gap between a gallous story and a dirty deed\\\" . In other words, the act is far less attractive in reality than it is in a story. She then instructs the men to take Christy away, lest they all go on trial for his crime. Christy begs for mercy and release, promising to run away and live like a wild man in the rough. They pull the rope tighter, and Pegeen threatens to burn his legs in the fire. In a speech of elevated language, Christy threatens to kill them before he's hanged. As he writhes on the floor, he bites at Shawn's leg, laughing. He proudly anticipates Satan's welcome once he reaches hell, for none too many have \\\"killed their da\\\" in County Mayo . Unnoticed, Old Mahon crawls in on all fours. As Christy struggles, Pegeen burns his leg with a sod and they drag him along the floor until he comes face to face with his father. Christy asks his father if he has come to be a killed a third time, but Mahon merely inquires why he is tied up. Michael apologetically explains that they must bring Christy to the authorities in order to protect themselves from charges of criminal activity. Mahon responds that he cares nothing for what happens to Michael and this crew, but that he and his son will certainly amuse themselves for years to come with stories of Mayo's villainy. Mahon loosens Christy's bonds, and order his son to leave with him. Christy agrees, but insists that he will be the \\\"gallant captain\\\" and his father the \\\"heathen slave\\\" . He pushes Old Mahon, warning that he himself is the boss now, and the dazed older man wonders whether he has gone \\\"crazy again,\\\" so strange is his son's aggressive behavior . Christy thanks the assembled group, explaining that from this day forward, he will go \\\"romancing through a romping lifetime\\\" . Then, he and his father exit. Shawn approaches Pegeen, overjoyed that they can now wed. As he complains about the bite on his leg, Pegeen boxes his ears and sends him out of her sight. In a flurry, mostly to herself, Pegeen laments Christy's departure, crying wildly, \\\"Oh, my grief, I've lost him surely. I've lost the only Playboy of the Western World\\\" .\", \"analysis\": \"In 1896, Synge joined W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory and George Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society. The Irish National Theatre -- rechristened The Abbey Theatre in 1904 -- intended to provide a \\\"Theory of Regeneration\\\" for Irish culture. This regeneration took the form of artistic exploration intended to revitalize contemporary Irish identity following decades of poverty, famine and political impotence under the grip of the English crown. In this way, political nationalism became literary nationalism, as the public declared its identity largely by embracing Ireland's rich literary past of hero-centered myth and saga. One of the most famous heroes of Irish myth is Cu Chulainn , about whom writings date from the 8th century. A tragic turn of Cu Chulainn's story is that he killed his own son, mistaking the boy for an intruder. His mistake was largely the result of not having seen his son for 8 years. The Abbey Theatre's audience certainly recognized the Cu Chulainn allusion within The Playboy, but also noted that Synge had inverted it, making it craven rather than heroic. Where Cu Chulainn - living alone, without family - possessed extraordinary strength and wisdom, here Christy - previously joined at the hip to his drunken father - was dull and weak-limbed, never having traveled before stumbling upon Mayo. Cu Chulainn purposefully slew an intruder, learning afterwards the boy was his son. Christy struck haphazardly at his father, contriving afterwards to elevate the act to heroic murder. Cu Chulainn's grief brought him low; Christy's lie raised him up. If the inversion of the Cu Chulainn legend offended, worse still was the perceived inversion of the Biblical father-son relationship. God-the-father, beneficent and almighty, sacrifices his only son for the salvation of all mankind, but pathetic and weak Christy , smites his only father solely for his own personal good. In a further twist to the allusion, Christy \\\"kills\\\" his father three times, all of them metaphorical, in a fantasia of parricide. These acts lead to Christy's rebirth at the end of the play, again evoking Christ's rebirth. Consider that Pegeen burns Christy's leg: It is baptism by fire. At the end of the play, one can begin to see why the play was so controversial. Synge seems to be deliberately flouting the myths and beliefs by which his audience defined themselves. He presents a country full of ironic chaos, hardly the romantic stuff of National Regeneration. By the end of the play, the villagers of County Mayo have no one left on whom to pin their hopes or to enact their dreams. Synge leaves them adrift, devoid of focus. Christy, on the other hand, rises from the ashes of his ordeal a new man with new eyes. Unfettered by love, law, morality or god, he exits the play a \\\"gallant master with his heathen slave\\\" . Christ died for everyone, and everyone was better because of it. Christy murdered for himself, and everyone but him is worse off as a result. In a sense, it is almost as is Synge is merely trying to provoke and mock, rather than to make any coherent point. And yet one realizes with distance how the play does indeed celebrate mankind, though it does so by celebrating the power of the individual and the imagination. The shared cultural myths prove less powerful in this play than does the individual's capacity for self-creation. Christy's self-creation begins as literal fiction, one in which he is the hero of his own tall tale, but ends as fiction literalized, as Christy grows to inhabit his own lie's words. He becomes what he creates. Expression engenders desire, awakening a new capacity for action. It is not Christy's burgeoning confidence in wooing Pegeen that represents this newfound capacity for action, nor is it his unexpected athletic prowess in the beach games. It is not even his mad dash offstage to \\\"murder\\\" his father a second time. Instead, it is, ironically, the failure of words - the failure of the lie - that ultimately empowers him. In the moment where Pegeen turns against him, Christy has his great epiphany: \\\"...you're after making a mighty man of me this day by the power of a lie...\\\" . By recognizing how his imagination could have such power over his actual life, Christy ensures that his change will not be temporary, but will persist. Moreover, the lie is powerful precisely because it has no direct correlation to truth. What Christy loses when Pegeen repudiates him is a fall from her imagination. His lie has failed. However, what he does in turn shows the full capacity of human self-determination. He decides to continue believing it. By the end of the play, he has deemed her unworthy of him, rather than the other way around. If Christy has fallen from Pegeen's imagination, then he merely needs to reorder his perspective so that it is her imagination that has suffered worse. Because she can no longer accept the lie of his great heroism - whereas he decides to continue believing it - she is worse off than he is, and so is he able to leave the pub with his head held high. Thus would the original audience has been terribly and violently confused. From their perspective, Christy seemed like a loser, a murderer, a liar. And yet from his perspective - and from the playwright's - he exits the pub a true \\\"playboy\\\" - a man of genuine self-confidence triumphing through imagination, language and potential. His triumph has nothing to do with the violence of patricide, but rather with the discovery of his individual power. As Christy leaves with such power, Pegeen's loss is felt even greater. Synge's deliberate attempt to write a theatre of both \\\"reality\\\" and \\\"joy\\\" finds a great articulation in the play's final moment. His affection for the lives and language of the Mayo villagers is unmistakable throughout. They are all such colorful characters with great theatricality. And yet that joy is matched by the \\\"reality\\\" of their desperation, born from being so separated from the rest of the world, living a life where a vivacious girl like Pegeen will end up marrying a craven like Shawn simply from traditional expectations and a lack of options. The comedic play ends on a terribly tragic note as Pegeen realizes the reality of her life, a reality divorced from the power to create a new world as Christy has for himself. She chose the reality of her village over his imaginative potential, and thus has \\\"lost the only Playboy in the Western World\\\" .\"}","chapter":"SCENE, [as before. Later in the day. Jimmy comes in, slightly drunk.]\n\nJIMMY -- [calls.] Pegeen! (Crosses to inner door.) Pegeen Mike! (Comes\nback again into the room.) Pegeen! (Philly comes in in the same state.)\n(To Philly.) Did you see herself?\n\nPHILLY. I did not; but I sent Shawn Keogh with the ass cart for to bear\nhim home. (Trying cupboards which are locked.) Well, isn't he a nasty\nman to get into such staggers at a morning wake? and isn't herself the\ndivil's daughter for locking, and she so fussy after that young gaffer,\nyou might take your death with drought and none to heed you?\n\nJIMMY. It's little wonder she'd be fussy, and he after bringing bankrupt\nruin on the roulette man, and the trick-o'-the-loop man, and breaking\nthe nose of the cockshot-man, and winning all in the sports below,\nracing, lepping, dancing, and the Lord knows what! He's right luck, I'm\ntelling you.\n\nPHILLY. If he has, he'll be rightly hobbled yet, and he not able to say\nten words without making a brag of the way he killed his father, and the\ngreat blow he hit with the loy.\n\nJIMMY. A man can't hang by his own informing, and his father should be\nrotten by now. [Old Mahon passes window slowly.]\n\nPHILLY. Supposing a man's digging spuds in that field with a long spade,\nand supposing he flings up the two halves of that skull, what'll be said\nthen in the papers and the courts of law?\n\nJIMMY. They'd say it was an old Dane, maybe, was drowned in the flood.\n(Old Mahon comes in and sits down near door listening.) Did you never\nhear tell of the skulls they have in the city of Dublin, ranged out like\nblue jugs in a cabin of Connaught?\n\nPHILLY. And you believe that?\n\nJIMMY -- [pugnaciously.] Didn't a lad see them and he after coming\nfrom harvesting in the Liverpool boat? \"They have them there,\" says he,\n\"making a show of the great people there was one time walking the world.\nWhite skulls and black skulls and yellow skulls, and some with full\nteeth, and some haven't only but one.\"\n\nPHILLY. It was no lie, maybe, for when I was a young lad there was a\ngraveyard beyond the house with the remnants of a man who had thighs as\nlong as your arm. He was a horrid man, I'm telling you, and there was\nmany a fine Sunday I'd put him together for fun, and he with shiny\nbones, you wouldn't meet the like of these days in the cities of the\nworld.\n\nMAHON -- [getting up.] -- You wouldn't is it? Lay your eyes on that\nskull, and tell me where and when there was another the like of it, is\nsplintered only from the blow of a loy.\n\nPHILLY. Glory be to God! And who hit you at all?\n\nMAHON -- [triumphantly.] It was my own son hit me. Would you believe\nthat?\n\nJIMMY. Well, there's wonders hidden in the heart of man!\n\nPHILLY -- [suspiciously.] And what way was it done?\n\nMAHON -- [wandering about the room.] -- I'm after walking hundreds and\nlong scores of miles, winning clean beds and the fill of my belly four\ntimes in the day, and I doing nothing but telling stories of that naked\ntruth. (He comes to them a little aggressively.) Give me a supeen and\nI'll tell you now. [Widow Quin comes in and stands aghast behind him. He\nis facing Jimmy and Philly, who are on the left.]\n\nJIMMY. Ask herself beyond. She's the stuff hidden in her shawl.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [coming to Mahon quickly.] -- you here, is it? You didn't\ngo far at all?\n\nMAHON. I seen the coasting steamer passing, and I got a drought upon me\nand a cramping leg, so I said, \"The divil go along with him,\" and turned\nagain. (Looking under her shawl.) And let you give me a supeen, for I'm\ndestroyed travelling since Tuesday was a week.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [getting a glass, in a cajoling tone.] -- Sit down then by\nthe fire and take your ease for a space. You've a right to be destroyed\nindeed, with your walking, and fighting, and facing the sun (giving him\npoteen from a stone jar she has brought in.) There now is a drink for\nyou, and may it be to your happiness and length of life.\n\nMAHON -- [taking glass greedily and sitting down by fire.] -- God\nincrease you!\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [taking men to the right stealthily.] -- Do you know what?\nThat man's raving from his wound to-day, for I met him a while since\ntelling a rambling tale of a tinker had him destroyed. Then he heard of\nChristy's deed, and he up and says it was his son had cracked his skull.\nO isn't madness a fright, for he'll go killing someone yet, and he\nthinking it's the man has struck him so?\n\nJIMMY -- [entirely convinced.] It's a fright, surely. I knew a party\nwas kicked in the head by a red mare, and he went killing horses a great\nwhile, till he eat the insides of a clock and died after.\n\nPHILLY -- [with suspicion.] -- Did he see Christy?\n\nWIDOW QUIN. He didn't. (With a warning gesture.) Let you not be putting\nhim in mind of him, or you'll be likely summoned if there's murder done.\n(Looking round at Mahon.) Whisht! He's listening. Wait now till you hear\nme taking him easy and unravelling all. (She goes to Mahon.) And what\nway are you feeling, mister? Are you in contentment now?\n\nMAHON -- [slightly emotional from his drink.] -- I'm poorly only, for\nit's a hard story the way I'm left to-day, when it was I did tend him\nfrom his hour of birth, and he a dunce never reached his second book,\nthe way he'd come from school, many's the day, with his legs lamed under\nhim, and he blackened with his beatings like a tinker's ass. It's a hard\nstory, I'm saying, the way some do have their next and nighest raising\nup a hand of murder on them, and some is lonesome getting their death\nwith lamentation in the dead of night.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [not knowing what to say.] -- To hear you talking so\nquiet, who'd know you were the same fellow we seen pass to-day?\n\nMAHON. I'm the same surely. The wrack and ruin of three score years;\nand it's a terror to live that length, I tell you, and to have your\nsons going to the dogs against you, and you wore out scolding them, and\nskelping them, and God knows what.\n\nPHILLY -- [to Jimmy.] -- He's not raving. (To Widow Quin.) Will you ask\nhim what kind was his son?\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [to Mahon, with a peculiar look.] -- Was your son that\nhit you a lad of one year and a score maybe, a great hand at racing and\nlepping and licking the world?\n\nMAHON -- [turning on her with a roar of rage.] -- Didn't you hear me say\nhe was the fool of men, the way from this out he'll know the orphan's\nlot with old and young making game of him and they swearing, raging,\nkicking at him like a mangy cur. [A great burst of cheering outside,\nsomeway off.]\n\nMAHON -- [putting his hands to his ears.] -- What in the name of God do\nthey want roaring below?\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [with the shade of a smile.] -- They're cheering a young\nlad, the champion Playboy of the Western World. [More cheering.]\n\nMAHON -- [going to window.] It'd split my heart to hear them, and I with\npulses in my brain-pan for a week gone by. Is it racing they are?\n\nJIMMY -- [looking from door.] -- It is then. They are mounting him for\nthe mule race will be run upon the sands. That's the playboy on the\nwinkered mule.\n\nMAHON [puzzled.] That lad, is it? If you said it was a fool he was,\nI'd have laid a mighty oath he was the likeness of my wandering son\n(uneasily, putting his hand to his head.) Faith, I'm thinking I'll go\nwalking for to view the race.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [stopping him, sharply.] -- You will not. You'd best take\nthe road to Belmullet, and not be dilly-dallying in this place where\nthere isn't a spot you could sleep.\n\nPHILLY -- [coming forward.] -- Don't mind her. Mount there on the bench\nand you'll have a view of the whole. They're hurrying before the tide\nwill rise, and it'd be near over if you went down the pathway through\nthe crags below.\n\nMAHON [mounts on bench, Widow Quin beside him.] -- That's a right view\nagain the edge of the sea. They're coming now from the point. He's\nleading. Who is he at all?\n\nWIDOW QUIN. He's the champion of the world, I tell you, and there isn't\na hop'orth isn't falling lucky to his hands to-day.\n\nPHILLY -- [looking out, interested in the race.] -- Look at that.\nThey're pressing him now.\n\nJIMMY. He'll win it yet.\n\nPHILLY. Take your time, Jimmy Farrell. It's too soon to say.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [shouting.] Watch him taking the gate. There's riding.\n\nJIMMY -- [cheering.] More power to the young lad!\n\nMAHON. He's passing the third.\n\nJIMMY. He'll lick them yet!\n\nWIDOW QUIN. He'd lick them if he was running races with a score itself.\n\nMAHON. Look at the mule he has, kicking the stars.\n\nWIDOW QUIN. There was a lep! (catching hold of Mahon in her excitement.)\nHe's fallen! He's mounted again! Faith, he's passing them all!\n\nJIMMY. Look at him skelping her!\n\nPHILLY. And the mountain girls hooshing him on!\n\nJIMMY. It's the last turn! The post's cleared for them now!\n\nMAHON. Look at the narrow place. He'll be into the bogs! (With a yell.)\nGood rider! He's through it again!\n\nJIMMY. He neck and neck!\n\nMAHON. Good boy to him! Flames, but he's in! [Great cheering, in which\nall join.]\n\nMAHON [with hesitation.] What's that? They're raising him up. They're\ncoming this way. (With a roar of rage and astonishment.) It's Christy!\nby the stars of God! I'd know his way of spitting and he astride the\nmoon. [He jumps down and makes for the door, but Widow Quin catches him\nand pulls him back.]\n\nWIDOW QUIN. Stay quiet, will you. That's not your son. (To Jimmy.) Stop\nhim, or you'll get a month for the abetting of manslaughter and be fined\nas well.\n\nJIMMY. I'll hold him.\n\nMAHON [struggling.] Let me out! Let me out, the lot of you! till I have\nmy vengeance on his head to-day.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [shaking him, vehemently.] -- That's not your son. That's\na man is going to make a marriage with the daughter of this house, a\nplace with fine trade, with a license, and with poteen too.\n\nMAHON -- [amazed.] That man marrying a decent and a moneyed girl! Is it\nmad yous are? Is it in a crazy-house for females that I'm landed now?\n\nWIDOW QUIN. It's mad yourself is with the blow upon your head. That lad\nis the wonder of the Western World.\n\nMAHON. I seen it's my son.\n\nWIDOW QUIN. You seen that you're mad. (Cheering outside.) Do you hear\nthem cheering him in the zig-zags of the road? Aren't you after saying\nthat your son's a fool, and how would they be cheering a true idiot\nborn?\n\nMAHON -- [getting distressed.] -- It's maybe out of reason that that\nman's himself. (Cheering again.) There's none surely will go cheering\nhim. Oh, I'm raving with a madness that would fright the world! (He sits\ndown with his hand to his head.) There was one time I seen ten scarlet\ndivils letting on they'd cork my spirit in a gallon can; and one time I\nseen rats as big as badgers sucking the life blood from the butt of\nmy lug; but I never till this day confused that dribbling idiot with a\nlikely man. I'm destroyed surely.\n\nWIDOW QUIN. And who'd wonder when it's your brain-pan that is gaping\nnow?\n\nMAHON. Then the blight of the sacred drought upon myself and him, for\nI never went mad to this day, and I not three weeks with the Limerick\ngirls drinking myself silly, and parlatic from the dusk to dawn. (To\nWidow Quin, suddenly.) Is my visage astray?\n\nWIDOW QUIN. It is then. You're a sniggering maniac, a child could see.\n\nMAHON -- [getting up more cheerfully.] -- Then I'd best be going to\nthe union beyond, and there'll be a welcome before me, I tell you (with\ngreat pride), and I a terrible and fearful case, the way that there I\nwas one time, screeching in a straightened waistcoat, with seven doctors\nwriting out my sayings in a printed book. Would you believe that?\n\nWIDOW QUIN. If you're a wonder itself, you'd best be hasty, for them\nlads caught a maniac one time and pelted the poor creature till he ran\nout, raving and foaming, and was drowned in the sea.\n\nMAHON -- [with philosophy.] -- It's true mankind is the divil when your\nhead's astray. Let me out now and I'll slip down the boreen, and not see\nthem so.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [showing him out.] -- That's it. Run to the right, and not\na one will see. [He runs off.]\n\nPHILLY -- [wisely.] You're at some gaming, Widow Quin; but I'll walk\nafter him and give him his dinner and a time to rest, and I'll see then\nif he's raving or as sane as you.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [annoyed.] If you go near that lad, let you be wary of\nyour head, I'm saying. Didn't you hear him telling he was crazed at\ntimes?\n\nPHILLY. I heard him telling a power; and I'm thinking we'll have right\nsport, before night will fall. [He goes out.]\n\nJIMMY. Well, Philly's a conceited and foolish man. How could that madman\nhave his senses and his brain-pan slit? I'll go after them and see him\nturn on Philly now. [He goes; Widow Quin hides poteen behind counter.\nThen hubbub outside.]\n\nVOICES. There you are! Good jumper! Grand lepper! Darlint boy! He's the\nracer! Bear him on, will you! [Christy comes in, in Jockey's dress, with\nPegeen Mike, Sara, and other girls, and men.]\n\nPEGEEN -- [to crowd.] -- Go on now and don't destroy him and he\ndrenching with sweat. Go along, I'm saying, and have your tug-of-warring\ntill he's dried his skin.\n\nCROWD. Here's his prizes! A bagpipes! A fiddle was played by a poet in\nthe years gone by! A flat and three-thorned blackthorn would lick the\nscholars out of Dublin town!\n\nCHRISTY -- [taking prizes from the men.] -- Thank you kindly, the lot of\nyou. But you'd say it was little only I did this day if you'd seen me a\nwhile since striking my one single blow.\n\nTOWN CRIER -- [outside, ringing a bell.] -- Take notice, last event of\nthis day! Tug-of-warring on the green below! Come on, the lot of you!\nGreat achievements for all Mayo men!\n\nPEGEEN. Go on, and leave him for to rest and dry. Go on, I tell you, for\nhe'll do no more. (She hustles crowd out; Widow Quin following them.)\n\nMEN -- [going.] -- Come on then. Good luck for the while!\n\nPEGEEN -- [radiantly, wiping his face with her shawl.] -- Well, you're\nthe lad, and you'll have great times from this out when you could win\nthat wealth of prizes, and you sweating in the heat of noon!\n\nCHRISTY -- [looking at her with delight.] -- I'll have great times if\nI win the crowning prize I'm seeking now, and that's your promise that\nyou'll wed me in a fortnight, when our banns is called.\n\nPEGEEN -- [backing away from him.] -- You've right daring to go ask\nme that, when all knows you'll be starting to some girl in your own\ntownland, when your father's rotten in four months, or five.\n\nCHRISTY -- [indignantly.] Starting from you, is it? (He follows her.)\nI will not, then, and when the airs is warming in four months, or five,\nit's then yourself and me should be pacing Neifin in the dews of night,\nthe times sweet smells do be rising, and you'd see a little shiny new\nmoon, maybe, sinking on the hills.\n\nPEGEEN [looking at him playfully.] -- And it's that kind of a poacher's\nlove you'd make, Christy Mahon, on the sides of Neifin, when the night\nis down?\n\nCHRISTY. It's little you'll think if my love's a poacher's, or an\nearl's itself, when you'll feel my two hands stretched around you, and I\nsqueezing kisses on your puckered lips, till I'd feel a kind of pity for\nthe Lord God is all ages sitting lonesome in his golden chair.\n\nPEGEEN. That'll be right fun, Christy Mahon, and any girl would walk her\nheart out before she'd meet a young man was your like for eloquence, or\ntalk, at all.\n\nCHRISTY -- [encouraged.] Let you wait, to hear me talking, till we're\nastray in Erris, when Good Friday's by, drinking a sup from a well,\nand making mighty kisses with our wetted mouths, or gaming in a gap\nor sunshine, with yourself stretched back unto your necklace, in the\nflowers of the earth.\n\nPEGEEN -- [in a lower voice, moved by his tone.] -- I'd be nice so, is\nit?\n\nCHRISTY -- [with rapture.] -- If the mitred bishops seen you that time,\nthey'd be the like of the holy prophets, I'm thinking, do be straining\nthe bars of Paradise to lay eyes on the Lady Helen of Troy, and she\nabroad, pacing back and forward, with a nosegay in her golden shawl.\n\nPEGEEN -- [with real tenderness.] -- And what is it I have, Christy\nMahon, to make me fitting entertainment for the like of you, that has\nsuch poet's talking, and such bravery of heart?\n\nCHRISTY -- [in a low voice.] -- Isn't there the light of seven heavens\nin your heart alone, the way you'll be an angel's lamp to me from this\nout, and I abroad in the darkness, spearing salmons in the Owen, or the\nCarrowmore?\n\nPEGEEN. If I was your wife, I'd be along with you those nights, Christy\nMahon, the way you'd see I was a great hand at coaxing bailiffs, or\ncoining funny nick-names for the stars of night.\n\nCHRISTY. You, is it? Taking your death in the hailstones, or in the fogs\nof dawn.\n\nPEGEEN. Yourself and me would shelter easy in a narrow bush, (with a\nqualm of dread) but we're only talking, maybe, for this would be a poor,\nthatched place to hold a fine lad is the like of you.\n\nCHRISTY -- [putting his arm round her.] -- If I wasn't a good Christian,\nit's on my naked knees I'd be saying my prayers and paters to every\njackstraw you have roofing your head, and every stony pebble is paving\nthe laneway to your door.\n\nPEGEEN -- [radiantly.] If that's the truth, I'll be burning candles from\nthis out to the miracles of God that have brought you from the south\nto-day, and I, with my gowns bought ready, the way that I can wed you,\nand not wait at all.\n\nCHRISTY. It's miracles, and that's the truth. Me there toiling a long\nwhile, and walking a long while, not knowing at all I was drawing all\ntimes nearer to this holy day.\n\nPEGEEN. And myself, a girl, was tempted often to go sailing the seas\ntill I'd marry a Jew-man, with ten kegs of gold, and I not knowing at\nall there was the like of you drawing nearer, like the stars of God.\n\nCHRISTY. And to think I'm long years hearing women talking that talk,\nto all bloody fools, and this the first time I've heard the like of your\nvoice talking sweetly for my own delight.\n\nPEGEEN. And to think it's me is talking sweetly, Christy Mahon, and I\nthe fright of seven townlands for my biting tongue. Well, the heart's a\nwonder; and, I'm thinking, there won't be our like in Mayo, for gallant\nlovers, from this hour, to-day. (Drunken singing is heard outside.)\nThere's my father coming from the wake, and when he's had his sleep\nwe'll tell him, for he's peaceful then. [They separate.]\n\nMICHAEL -- [singing outside] -- The jailor and the turnkey They quickly\nran us down, And brought us back as prisoners Once more to Cavan town.\n[He comes in supported by Shawn.] There we lay bewailing All in a prison\nbound.... [He sees Christy. Goes and shakes him drunkenly by the hand,\nwhile Pegeen and Shawn talk on the left.]\n\nMICHAEL -- [to Christy.] -- The blessing of God and the holy angels on\nyour head, young fellow. I hear tell you're after winning all in the\nsports below; and wasn't it a shame I didn't bear you along with me to\nKate Cassidy's wake, a fine, stout lad, the like of you, for you'd never\nsee the match of it for flows of drink, the way when we sunk her bones\nat noonday in her narrow grave, there were five men, aye, and six men,\nstretched out retching speechless on the holy stones.\n\nCHRISTY -- [uneasily, watching Pegeen.] -- Is that the truth?\n\nMICHAEL. It is then, and aren't you a louty schemer to go burying your\npoor father unbeknownst when you'd a right to throw him on the crupper\nof a Kerry mule and drive him westwards, like holy Joseph in the days\ngone by, the way we could have given him a decent burial, and not have\nhim rotting beyond, and not a Christian drinking a smart drop to the\nglory of his soul?\n\nCHRISTY -- [gruffly.] It's well enough he's lying, for the likes of him.\n\nMICHAEL -- [slapping him on the back.] -- Well, aren't you a hardened\nslayer? It'll be a poor thing for the household man where you go\nsniffing for a female wife; and (pointing to Shawn) look beyond at that\nshy and decent Christian I have chosen for my daughter's hand, and I\nafter getting the gilded dispensation this day for to wed them now.\n\nCHRISTY. And you'll be wedding them this day, is it?\n\nMICHAEL -- [drawing himself up.] -- Aye. Are you thinking, if I'm drunk\nitself, I'd leave my daughter living single with a little frisky rascal\nis the like of you?\n\nPEGEEN -- [breaking away from Shawn.] -- Is it the truth the\ndispensation's come?\n\nMICHAEL -- [triumphantly.] Father Reilly's after reading it in gallous\nLatin, and \"It's come in the nick of time,\" says he; \"so I'll wed them\nin a hurry, dreading that young gaffer who'd capsize the stars.\"\n\nPEGEEN -- [fiercely.] He's missed his nick of time, for it's that lad,\nChristy Mahon, that I'm wedding now.\n\nMICHAEL -- [loudly with horror.] -- You'd be making him a son to me, and\nhe wet and crusted with his father's blood?\n\nPEGEEN. Aye. Wouldn't it be a bitter thing for a girl to go marrying the\nlike of Shaneen, and he a middling kind of a scarecrow, with no savagery\nor fine words in him at all?\n\nMICHAEL -- [gasping and sinking on a chair.] -- Oh, aren't you a heathen\ndaughter to go shaking the fat of my heart, and I swamped and drownded\nwith the weight of drink? Would you have them turning on me the way that\nI'd be roaring to the dawn of day with the wind upon my heart? Have you\nnot a word to aid me, Shaneen? Are you not jealous at all?\n\nSHANEEN -- [In great misery.] -- I'd be afeard to be jealous of a man\ndid slay his da.\n\nPEGEEN. Well, it'd be a poor thing to go marrying your like. I'm seeing\nthere's a world of peril for an orphan girl, and isn't it a great\nblessing I didn't wed you, before himself came walking from the west or\nsouth?\n\nSHAWN. It's a queer story you'd go picking a dirty tramp up from the\nhighways of the world.\n\nPEGEEN -- [playfully.] And you think you're a likely beau to go straying\nalong with, the shiny Sundays of the opening year, when it's sooner on\na bullock's liver you'd put a poor girl thinking than on the lily or the\nrose?\n\nSHAWN. And have you no mind of my weight of passion, and the holy\ndispensation, and the drift of heifers I am giving, and the golden ring?\n\nPEGEEN. I'm thinking you're too fine for the like of me, Shawn Keogh of\nKillakeen, and let you go off till you'd find a radiant lady with droves\nof bullocks on the plains of Meath, and herself bedizened in the diamond\njewelleries of Pharaoh's ma. That'd be your match, Shaneen. So God save\nyou now! [She retreats behind Christy.]\n\nSHAWN. Won't you hear me telling you...?\n\nCHRISTY -- [with ferocity.] -- Take yourself from this, young fellow, or\nI'll maybe add a murder to my deeds to-day.\n\nMICHAEL -- [springing up with a shriek.] -- Murder is it? Is it mad yous\nare? Would you go making murder in this place, and it piled with poteen\nfor our drink to-night? Go on to the foreshore if it's fighting you\nwant, where the rising tide will wash all traces from the memory of man.\n[Pushing Shawn towards Christy.]\n\nSHAWN -- [shaking himself free, and getting behind Michael.] -- I'll\nnot fight him, Michael James. I'd liefer live a bachelor, simmering in\npassions to the end of time, than face a lepping savage the like of him\nhas descended from the Lord knows where. Strike him yourself, Michael\nJames, or you'll lose my drift of heifers and my blue bull from Sneem.\n\nMICHAEL. Is it me fight him, when it's father-slaying he's bred to now?\n(Pushing Shawn.) Go on you fool and fight him now.\n\nSHAWN -- [coming forward a little.] -- Will I strike him with my hand?\n\nMICHAEL. Take the loy is on your western side.\n\nSHAWN. I'd be afeard of the gallows if I struck him with that.\n\nCHRISTY -- [taking up the loy.] -- Then I'll make you face the gallows\nor quit off from this. [Shawn flies out of the door.]\n\nCHRISTY. Well, fine weather be after him, (going to Michael, coaxingly)\nand I'm thinking you wouldn't wish to have that quaking blackguard in\nyour house at all. Let you give us your blessing and hear her swear her\nfaith to me, for I'm mounted on the spring-tide of the stars of luck,\nthe way it'll be good for any to have me in the house.\n\nPEGEEN [at the other side of Michael.] -- Bless us now, for I swear to\nGod I'll wed him, and I'll not renege.\n\nMICHAEL -- [standing up in the centre, holding on to both of them.] --\nIt's the will of God, I'm thinking, that all should win an easy or a\ncruel end, and it's the will of God that all should rear up lengthy\nfamilies for the nurture of the earth. What's a single man, I ask you,\neating a bit in one house and drinking a sup in another, and he with no\nplace of his own, like an old braying jackass strayed upon the rocks?\n(To Christy.) It's many would be in dread to bring your like into their\nhouse for to end them, maybe, with a sudden end; but I'm a decent man\nof Ireland, and I liefer face the grave untimely and I seeing a score of\ngrandsons growing up little gallant swearers by the name of God, than\ngo peopling my bedside with puny weeds the like of what you'd breed, I'm\nthinking, out of Shaneen Keogh. (He joins their hands.) A daring fellow\nis the jewel of the world, and a man did split his father's middle with\na single clout, should have the bravery of ten, so may God and Mary and\nSt. Patrick bless you, and increase you from this mortal day.\n\nCHRISTY AND PEGEEN. Amen, O Lord!\n\n[Hubbub outside.]\n\n[Old Mahon rushes in, followed by all the crowd, and Widow Quin. He\nmakes a rush at Christy, knocks him down, and begins to beat him.]\n\nPEGEEN -- [dragging back his arm.] -- Stop that, will you. Who are you\nat all?\n\nMAHON. His father, God forgive me!\n\nPEGEEN -- [drawing back.] -- Is it rose from the dead?\n\nMAHON. Do you think I look so easy quenched with the tap of a loy?\n[Beats Christy again.]\n\nPEGEEN -- [glaring at Christy.] -- And it's lies you told, letting on\nyou had him slitted, and you nothing at all.\n\nCHRISTY -- [clutching Mahon's stick.] -- He's not my father. He's a\nraving maniac would scare the world. (Pointing to Widow Quin.) Herself\nknows it is true.\n\nCROWD. You're fooling Pegeen! The Widow Quin seen him this day, and you\nlikely knew! You're a liar!\n\nCHRISTY -- [dumbfounded.] It's himself was a liar, lying stretched out\nwith an open head on him, letting on he was dead.\n\nMAHON. Weren't you off racing the hills before I got my breath with the\nstart I had seeing you turn on me at all?\n\nPEGEEN. And to think of the coaxing glory we had given him, and he after\ndoing nothing but hitting a soft blow and chasing northward in a sweat\nof fear. Quit off from this.\n\nCHRISTY -- [piteously.] You've seen my doings this day, and let you save\nme from the old man; for why would you be in such a scorch of haste to\nspur me to destruction now?\n\nPEGEEN. It's there your treachery is spurring me, till I'm hard set to\nthink you're the one I'm after lacing in my heart-strings half-an-hour\ngone by. (To Mahon.) Take him on from this, for I think bad the world\nshould see me raging for a Munster liar, and the fool of men.\n\nMAHON. Rise up now to retribution, and come on with me.\n\nCROWD -- [jeeringly.] There's the playboy! There's the lad thought he'd\nrule the roost in Mayo. Slate him now, mister.\n\nCHRISTY -- [getting up in shy terror.] -- What is it drives you to\ntorment me here, when I'd asked the thunders of the might of God to\nblast me if I ever did hurt to any saving only that one single blow.\n\nMAHON -- [loudly.] If you didn't, you're a poor good-for-nothing, and\nisn't it by the like of you the sins of the whole world are committed?\n\nCHRISTY -- [raising his hands.] -- In the name of the Almighty God....\n\nMAHON. Leave troubling the Lord God. Would you have him sending down\ndroughts, and fevers, and the old hen and the cholera morbus?\n\nCHRISTY -- [to Widow Quin.] -- Will you come between us and protect me\nnow?\n\nWIDOW QUIN. I've tried a lot, God help me, and my share is done.\n\nCHRISTY -- [looking round in desperation.] -- And I must go back into\nmy torment is it, or run off like a vagabond straying through the Unions\nwith the dusts of August making mudstains in the gullet of my throat,\nor the winds of March blowing on me till I'd take an oath I felt them\nmaking whistles of my ribs within?\n\nSARA. Ask Pegeen to aid you. Her like does often change.\n\nCHRISTY. I will not then, for there's torment in the splendour of her\nlike, and she a girl any moon of midnight would take pride to meet,\nfacing southwards on the heaths of Keel. But what did I want crawling\nforward to scorch my understanding at her flaming brow?\n\nPEGEEN -- [to Mahon, vehemently, fearing she will break into tears.] --\nTake him on from this or I'll set the young lads to destroy him here.\n\nMAHON -- [going to him, shaking his stick.] -- Come on now if you\nwouldn't have the company to see you skelped.\n\nPEGEEN -- [half laughing, through her tears.] -- That's it, now the\nworld will see him pandied, and he an ugly liar was playing off the\nhero, and the fright of men.\n\nCHRISTY -- [to Mahon, very sharply.] -- Leave me go!\n\nCROWD. That's it. Now Christy. If them two set fighting, it will lick\nthe world.\n\nMAHON -- [making a grab at Christy.] -- Come here to me.\n\nCHRISTY -- [more threateningly.] -- Leave me go, I'm saying.\n\nMAHON. I will maybe, when your legs is limping, and your back is blue.\n\nCROWD. Keep it up, the two of you. I'll back the old one. Now the\nplayboy.\n\nCHRISTY -- [in low and intense voice.] -- Shut your yelling, for if\nyou're after making a mighty man of me this day by the power of a lie,\nyou're setting me now to think if it's a poor thing to be lonesome,\nit's worse maybe to go mixing with the fools of earth. [Mahon makes a\nmovement towards him.]\n\nCHRISTY -- [almost shouting.] -- Keep off... lest I do show a blow\nunto the lot of you would set the guardian angels winking in the clouds\nabove. [He swings round with a sudden rapid movement and picks up a\nloy.]\n\nCROWD -- [half frightened, half amused.] -- He's going mad! Mind\nyourselves! Run from the idiot!\n\nCHRISTY. If I am an idiot, I'm after hearing my voice this day saying\nwords would raise the topknot on a poet in a merchant's town. I've won\nyour racing, and your lepping, and...\n\nMAHON. Shut your gullet and come on with me.\n\nCHRISTY. I'm going, but I'll stretch you first. [He runs at old Mahon\nwith the loy, chases him out of the door, followed by crowd and Widow\nQuin. There is a great noise outside, then a yell, and dead silence for\na moment. Christy comes in, half dazed, and goes to fire.]\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [coming in, hurriedly, and going to him.] -- They're\nturning again you. Come on, or you'll be hanged, indeed.\n\nCHRISTY. I'm thinking, from this out, Pegeen'll be giving me praises the\nsame as in the hours gone by.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [impatiently.] Come by the back-door. I'd think bad to\nhave you stifled on the gallows tree.\n\nCHRISTY -- [indignantly.] I will not, then. What good'd be my life-time,\nif I left Pegeen?\n\nWIDOW QUIN. Come on, and you'll be no worse than you were last night;\nand you with a double murder this time to be telling to the girls.\n\nCHRISTY. I'll not leave Pegeen Mike.\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [impatiently.] Isn't there the match of her in every\nparish public, from Binghamstown unto the plain of Meath? Come on, I\ntell you, and I'll find you finer sweethearts at each waning moon.\n\nCHRISTY. It's Pegeen I'm seeking only, and what'd I care if you brought\nme a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts itself, maybe,\nfrom this place to the Eastern World?\n\nSARA -- [runs in, pulling off one of her petticoats.] -- They're going\nto hang him. (Holding out petticoat and shawl.) Fit these upon him, and\nlet him run off to the east.\n\nWIDOW QUIN. He's raving now; but we'll fit them on him, and I'll take\nhim, in the ferry, to the Achill boat.\n\nCHRISTY -- [struggling feebly.] -- Leave me go, will you? when I'm\nthinking of my luck to-day, for she will wed me surely, and I a proven\nhero in the end of all. [They try to fasten petticoat round him.]\n\nWIDOW QUIN. Take his left hand, and we'll pull him now. Come on, young\nfellow.\n\nCHRISTY -- [suddenly starting up.] -- You'll be taking me from her?\nYou're jealous, is it, of her wedding me? Go on from this. [He snatches\nup a stool, and threatens them with it.]\n\nWIDOW QUIN -- [going.] -- It's in the mad-house they should put him,\nnot in jail, at all. We'll go by the back-door, to call the doctor, and\nwe'll save him so. [She goes out, with Sara, through inner room. Men\ncrowd in the doorway. Christy sits down again by the fire.]\n\nMICHAEL -- [in a terrified whisper.] -- Is the old lad killed surely?\n\nPHILLY. I'm after feeling the last gasps quitting his heart. [They peer\nin at Christy.]\n\nMICHAEL -- [with a rope.] -- Look at the way he is. Twist a hangman's\nknot on it, and slip it over his head, while he's not minding at all.\n\nPHILLY. Let you take it, Shaneen. You're the soberest of all that's\nhere.\n\nSHAWN. Is it me to go near him, and he the wickedest and worst with me?\nLet you take it, Pegeen Mike.\n\nPEGEEN. Come on, so. [She goes forward with the others, and they drop\nthe double hitch over his head.]\n\nCHRISTY. What ails you?\n\nSHAWN -- [triumphantly, as they pull the rope tight on his arms.] --\nCome on to the peelers, till they stretch you now.\n\nCHRISTY. Me!\n\nMICHAEL. If we took pity on you, the Lord God would, maybe, bring us\nruin from the law to-day, so you'd best come easy, for hanging is an\neasy and a speedy end.\n\nCHRISTY. I'll not stir. (To Pegeen.) And what is it you'll say to me,\nand I after doing it this time in the face of all?\n\nPEGEEN. I'll say, a strange man is a marvel, with his mighty talk; but\nwhat's a squabble in your back-yard, and the blow of a loy, have taught\nme that there's a great gap between a gallous story and a dirty deed.\n(To Men.) Take him on from this, or the lot of us will be likely put on\ntrial for his deed to-day.\n\nCHRISTY -- [with horror in his voice.] -- And it's yourself will send me\noff, to have a horny-fingered hangman hitching his bloody slip-knots at\nthe butt of my ear.\n\nMEN -- [pulling rope.] -- Come on, will you? [He is pulled down on the\nfloor.]\n\nCHRISTY -- [twisting his legs round the table.] -- Cut the rope, Pegeen,\nand I'll quit the lot of you, and live from this out, like the madmen of\nKeel, eating muck and green weeds, on the faces of the cliffs.\n\nPEGEEN. And leave us to hang, is it, for a saucy liar, the like of you?\n(To men.) Take him on, out from this.\n\nSHAWN. Pull a twist on his neck, and squeeze him so.\n\nPHILLY. Twist yourself. Sure he cannot hurt you, if you keep your\ndistance from his teeth alone.\n\nSHAWN. I'm afeard of him. (To Pegeen.) Lift a lighted sod, will you, and\nscorch his leg.\n\nPEGEEN -- [blowing the fire, with a bellows.] Leave go now, young\nfellow, or I'll scorch your shins.\n\nCHRISTY. You're blowing for to torture me (His voice rising and growing\nstronger.) That's your kind, is it? Then let the lot of you be wary,\nfor, if I've to face the gallows, I'll have a gay march down, I tell\nyou, and shed the blood of some of you before I die.\n\nSHAWN -- [in terror.] -- Keep a good hold, Philly. Be wary, for the love\nof God. For I'm thinking he would liefest wreak his pains on me.\n\nCHRISTY -- [almost gaily.] -- If I do lay my hands on you, it's the way\nyou'll be at the fall of night, hanging as a scarecrow for the fowls of\nhell. Ah, you'll have a gallous jaunt I'm saying, coaching out through\nLimbo with my father's ghost.\n\nSHAWN -- [to Pegeen.] -- Make haste, will you? Oh, isn't he a holy\nterror, and isn't it true for Father Reilly, that all drink's a curse\nthat has the lot of you so shaky and uncertain now?\n\nCHRISTY. If I can wring a neck among you, I'll have a royal judgment\nlooking on the trembling jury in the courts of law. And won't there be\ncrying out in Mayo the day I'm stretched upon the rope with ladies in\ntheir silks and satins snivelling in their lacy kerchiefs, and they\nrhyming songs and ballads on the terror of my fate? [He squirms round on\nthe floor and bites Shawn's leg.]\n\nSHAWN -- [shrieking.] My leg's bit on me. He's the like of a mad dog,\nI'm thinking, the way that I will surely die.\n\nCHRISTY -- [delighted with himself.] -- You will then, the way you can\nshake out hell's flags of welcome for my coming in two weeks or three,\nfor I'm thinking Satan hasn't many have killed their da in Kerry, and\nin Mayo too. [Old Mahon comes in behind on all fours and looks on\nunnoticed.]\n\nMEN -- [to Pegeen.] -- Bring the sod, will you?\n\nPEGEEN [coming over.] -- God help him so. (Burns his leg.)\n\nCHRISTY -- [kicking and screaming.] -- O, glory be to God! [He kicks\nloose from the table, and they all drag him towards the door.]\n\nJIMMY -- [seeing old Mahon.] -- Will you look what's come in? [They all\ndrop Christy and run left.]\n\nCHRISTY -- [scrambling on his knees face to face with old Mahon.] -- Are\nyou coming to be killed a third time, or what ails you now?\n\nMAHON. For what is it they have you tied?\n\nCHRISTY. They're taking me to the peelers to have me hanged for slaying\nyou.\n\nMICHAEL -- [apologetically.] It is the will of God that all should\nguard their little cabins from the treachery of law, and what would my\ndaughter be doing if I was ruined or was hanged itself?\n\nMAHON -- [grimly, loosening Christy.] -- It's little I care if you put a\nbag on her back, and went picking cockles till the hour of death; but\nmy son and myself will be going our own way, and we'll have great times\nfrom this out telling stories of the villainy of Mayo, and the fools is\nhere. (To Christy, who is freed.) Come on now.\n\nCHRISTY. Go with you, is it? I will then, like a gallant captain with\nhis heathen slave. Go on now and I'll see you from this day stewing my\noatmeal and washing my spuds, for I'm master of all fights from now.\n(Pushing Mahon.) Go on, I'm saying.\n\nMAHON. Is it me?\n\nCHRISTY. Not a word out of you. Go on from this.\n\nMAHON [walking out and looking back at Christy over his shoulder.] --\nGlory be to God! (With a broad smile.) I am crazy again! [Goes.]\n\nCHRISTY. Ten thousand blessings upon all that's here, for you've turned\nme a likely gaffer in the end of all, the way I'll go romancing through\na romping lifetime from this hour to the dawning of the judgment day.\n[He goes out.]\n\nMICHAEL. By the will of God, we'll have peace now for our drinks. Will\nyou draw the porter, Pegeen?\n\nSHAWN -- [going up to her.] -- It's a miracle Father Reilly can wed us\nin the end of all, and we'll have none to trouble us when his vicious\nbite is healed.\n\nPEGEEN -- [hitting him a box on the ear.] -- Quit my sight. (Putting\nher shawl over her head and breaking out into wild lamentations.) Oh my\ngrief, I've lost him surely. I've lost the only Playboy of the Western\nWorld.\n","chapter_length":6634.0,"summary_name":"Act III","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180329082528\/http:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-playboy-of-the-western-world\/study-guide\/summary-act-iii","summary_text":"Later that same day, Jimmy and Philly enter the pub looking for a drink, but neither Pegeen nor her father is there to serve them. The men comment on Pegeen's infatuation with Christy, who has routed every competitor on the beach. Though they acknowledge his skill as an athlete, they are annoyed by his incessant bragging over his heroic deed. They then discuss a collection of skulls on display in Dublin. Old Mahon enters to hear their talk, and shows them his own skull injury. When he attributes it to his good-for-nothing son, the men grow suspicious and ask for more detail. Mahon promises to oblige if they feed him supper, and reveals that he has been earning bed and board in exchange for the story of his son's attack. Widow Quin enters to find them in conversation, and she quickly separates them from one another. After giving Old Mahon a drink, she confides to Jimmy and Philly that Mahon is raving. She tells them how he had initially attributed his head fracture to a tinker's blow, but has changed his story after hearing tell of Christy's deed. Meanwhile, Mahon grows maudlin, lamenting his son's betrayal. Finding him credible, Jimmy and Philly ask for more detail about the son. However, the widow slyly interjects by asking Mahon whether his son was a great athlete. Naturally, Mahon denies that claim, insisting the boy is a mangy cur. Suddenly, they hear the crowd roaring from the beach. Though the sound pierces Mahon's aching head, he is curious about the commotion, and joins Jimmy and Philly to watch a tremendously exciting mule race in the distance. They all exclaim over the skill of the race champion, and then note that the crowd is carrying him towards the pub. When he recognizes this champion as Christy, Mahon cries out in shock. The widow insists his perception has been obscured by his injury, since his son could never have achieved such a victory. Confused, Mahon concedes the point, and insists he must check himself into an insane asylum, admitting that he has spent time there in the past. He exits, followed by Jimmy and Philly, who remain suspicious of the widow's story. As he is carried in by the crowd, overcome with prizes, Christy boasts that his mule race victory is nothing compared to his heroic murder. Pegeen proudly tends to Christy as the crowd disperses to watch the final event down on the beach. Once they are alone, Christy declares his wish to wed Pegeen in a fortnight. Pegeen hedges, insinuating he is a skirt-chaser. He rejects this suggestion, wooing her poetically and tenderly in the process. She softens, speaking tenderly in turn. Finally, Pegeen consents to marriage, noting how fortunate it is that she already has a dress. Michael, still drunk, enters with Shawn. Death still on his mind from the wake, Michael chastises Christy for having deprived his father of a Christian burial. Shawn then announces that he has received Father Reilly's dispensation, and that Michael has consented to have him and Pegeen married today. Michael adds that he does not want to leave Pegeen alone any longer with a reprobate like Christy. Pegeen defies her father by declaring her plan to marry Christy. Horrified his daughter would prefer a father-killer to a decent Christian, Michael urges Shawn to challenge Christy. Shawn's cowardly refusal to stand up for himself only hardens Pegeen against him. Shawn does tries to argue his case, citing the ring he has already bought, the promise he has made to give the family heifers, and the church's permission, but Pegeen remains unmoved. Christy threatens to murder Shawn if he persists, and Michael grows incensed at the suggestion, adding that he cannot allow a murder in his pub, especially since he has stocked so much illegal moonshine for the night's celebration. He encourages the men to bring their battle down to the beach, but Shawn remains steadfast in his refusal to fight. Michael reassesses the situation: If the goal of marriage is to procreate, then better Pegeen should procreate with brave Christy than create any small replicas of the cowardly Shawn. Convinced, Michael gives his blessing to Pegeen and Christy by bringing their hands together. They hear a hubbub outside, and then Old Mahon bursts in, followed by the crowd and Widow Quin. Mahon rushes at Christy, who cowers before his father's blows. Pegeen intervenes in the fight, and Old Mahon reveals that he is Christy's father. Pegeen immediately renounces Christy, who desperately claims that Mahon is a lunatic, and turns to Widow Quin to validate the lie. But Widow Quin can no longer hide the truth, and the crowd roars with pleasure at seeing Christy's lie unravel. Christy begs mercy for a moment, but then, in a sudden and lyrical expression of his fate, he accepts his own lowliness. Unfit for happiness, he could never endure the terrible splendor of a girl like Pegeen. Covering her tears, Pegeen urges Mahon to take his son away before she sets the town's boys on him. Her manner is derisive and desperate. As Mahon struggles to drag Christy away, the crowd eggs on the fight, until Christy turns on them, brandishing a spade. They back away gingerly, jeering in amusement that Christy has gone mad. Mahon goads his son once again, and Christy chases him from the building, the spade raised high. Everyone rushes out, following Christy. Offstage, there is a great yell, followed be silence. A dazed Christy stumbles back in, followed by the Widow Quin, who warns that he must leave at once since the crowd has turned on him. However, Christy refuses, hoping that Pegeen will want him again now that he has truly killed his father. The widow counters that there are woman like Pegeen all over the country, but he is unmoved. Sara runs in and removes her petticoats, hoping Christy will wear them as a makeshift disguise. However, Christy threatens the two women with a stool, and the widow suggests they should fetch the doctor since the man has clearly gone mad. They leave him alone. From the doorway, Michael, Philly, Shawn and Pegeen strategize how to trap Christy in a loop of rope. A frightened Shawn refuses to participate, so the others enter together and land the rope around his arms. Caught, Christy asks Pegeen how she feels about him now that he has actually committed the parricide. Pegeen answers: \"I'll say, a strange man is a marvel, with his mighty talk; but what's a squabble in your back yard, and the blow of a loy, have taught me that there's a great gap between a gallous story and a dirty deed\" . In other words, the act is far less attractive in reality than it is in a story. She then instructs the men to take Christy away, lest they all go on trial for his crime. Christy begs for mercy and release, promising to run away and live like a wild man in the rough. They pull the rope tighter, and Pegeen threatens to burn his legs in the fire. In a speech of elevated language, Christy threatens to kill them before he's hanged. As he writhes on the floor, he bites at Shawn's leg, laughing. He proudly anticipates Satan's welcome once he reaches hell, for none too many have \"killed their da\" in County Mayo . Unnoticed, Old Mahon crawls in on all fours. As Christy struggles, Pegeen burns his leg with a sod and they drag him along the floor until he comes face to face with his father. Christy asks his father if he has come to be a killed a third time, but Mahon merely inquires why he is tied up. Michael apologetically explains that they must bring Christy to the authorities in order to protect themselves from charges of criminal activity. Mahon responds that he cares nothing for what happens to Michael and this crew, but that he and his son will certainly amuse themselves for years to come with stories of Mayo's villainy. Mahon loosens Christy's bonds, and order his son to leave with him. Christy agrees, but insists that he will be the \"gallant captain\" and his father the \"heathen slave\" . He pushes Old Mahon, warning that he himself is the boss now, and the dazed older man wonders whether he has gone \"crazy again,\" so strange is his son's aggressive behavior . Christy thanks the assembled group, explaining that from this day forward, he will go \"romancing through a romping lifetime\" . Then, he and his father exit. Shawn approaches Pegeen, overjoyed that they can now wed. As he complains about the bite on his leg, Pegeen boxes his ears and sends him out of her sight. In a flurry, mostly to herself, Pegeen laments Christy's departure, crying wildly, \"Oh, my grief, I've lost him surely. I've lost the only Playboy of the Western World\" .","summary_analysis":"In 1896, Synge joined W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory and George Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society. The Irish National Theatre -- rechristened The Abbey Theatre in 1904 -- intended to provide a \"Theory of Regeneration\" for Irish culture. This regeneration took the form of artistic exploration intended to revitalize contemporary Irish identity following decades of poverty, famine and political impotence under the grip of the English crown. In this way, political nationalism became literary nationalism, as the public declared its identity largely by embracing Ireland's rich literary past of hero-centered myth and saga. One of the most famous heroes of Irish myth is Cu Chulainn , about whom writings date from the 8th century. A tragic turn of Cu Chulainn's story is that he killed his own son, mistaking the boy for an intruder. His mistake was largely the result of not having seen his son for 8 years. The Abbey Theatre's audience certainly recognized the Cu Chulainn allusion within The Playboy, but also noted that Synge had inverted it, making it craven rather than heroic. Where Cu Chulainn - living alone, without family - possessed extraordinary strength and wisdom, here Christy - previously joined at the hip to his drunken father - was dull and weak-limbed, never having traveled before stumbling upon Mayo. Cu Chulainn purposefully slew an intruder, learning afterwards the boy was his son. Christy struck haphazardly at his father, contriving afterwards to elevate the act to heroic murder. Cu Chulainn's grief brought him low; Christy's lie raised him up. If the inversion of the Cu Chulainn legend offended, worse still was the perceived inversion of the Biblical father-son relationship. God-the-father, beneficent and almighty, sacrifices his only son for the salvation of all mankind, but pathetic and weak Christy , smites his only father solely for his own personal good. In a further twist to the allusion, Christy \"kills\" his father three times, all of them metaphorical, in a fantasia of parricide. These acts lead to Christy's rebirth at the end of the play, again evoking Christ's rebirth. Consider that Pegeen burns Christy's leg: It is baptism by fire. At the end of the play, one can begin to see why the play was so controversial. Synge seems to be deliberately flouting the myths and beliefs by which his audience defined themselves. He presents a country full of ironic chaos, hardly the romantic stuff of National Regeneration. By the end of the play, the villagers of County Mayo have no one left on whom to pin their hopes or to enact their dreams. Synge leaves them adrift, devoid of focus. Christy, on the other hand, rises from the ashes of his ordeal a new man with new eyes. Unfettered by love, law, morality or god, he exits the play a \"gallant master with his heathen slave\" . Christ died for everyone, and everyone was better because of it. Christy murdered for himself, and everyone but him is worse off as a result. In a sense, it is almost as is Synge is merely trying to provoke and mock, rather than to make any coherent point. And yet one realizes with distance how the play does indeed celebrate mankind, though it does so by celebrating the power of the individual and the imagination. The shared cultural myths prove less powerful in this play than does the individual's capacity for self-creation. Christy's self-creation begins as literal fiction, one in which he is the hero of his own tall tale, but ends as fiction literalized, as Christy grows to inhabit his own lie's words. He becomes what he creates. Expression engenders desire, awakening a new capacity for action. It is not Christy's burgeoning confidence in wooing Pegeen that represents this newfound capacity for action, nor is it his unexpected athletic prowess in the beach games. It is not even his mad dash offstage to \"murder\" his father a second time. Instead, it is, ironically, the failure of words - the failure of the lie - that ultimately empowers him. In the moment where Pegeen turns against him, Christy has his great epiphany: \"...you're after making a mighty man of me this day by the power of a lie...\" . By recognizing how his imagination could have such power over his actual life, Christy ensures that his change will not be temporary, but will persist. Moreover, the lie is powerful precisely because it has no direct correlation to truth. What Christy loses when Pegeen repudiates him is a fall from her imagination. His lie has failed. However, what he does in turn shows the full capacity of human self-determination. He decides to continue believing it. By the end of the play, he has deemed her unworthy of him, rather than the other way around. If Christy has fallen from Pegeen's imagination, then he merely needs to reorder his perspective so that it is her imagination that has suffered worse. Because she can no longer accept the lie of his great heroism - whereas he decides to continue believing it - she is worse off than he is, and so is he able to leave the pub with his head held high. Thus would the original audience has been terribly and violently confused. From their perspective, Christy seemed like a loser, a murderer, a liar. And yet from his perspective - and from the playwright's - he exits the pub a true \"playboy\" - a man of genuine self-confidence triumphing through imagination, language and potential. His triumph has nothing to do with the violence of patricide, but rather with the discovery of his individual power. As Christy leaves with such power, Pegeen's loss is felt even greater. Synge's deliberate attempt to write a theatre of both \"reality\" and \"joy\" finds a great articulation in the play's final moment. His affection for the lives and language of the Mayo villagers is unmistakable throughout. They are all such colorful characters with great theatricality. And yet that joy is matched by the \"reality\" of their desperation, born from being so separated from the rest of the world, living a life where a vivacious girl like Pegeen will end up marrying a craven like Shawn simply from traditional expectations and a lack of options. The comedic play ends on a terribly tragic note as Pegeen realizes the reality of her life, a reality divorced from the power to create a new world as Christy has for himself. She chose the reality of her village over his imaginative potential, and thus has \"lost the only Playboy in the Western World\" .","summary_length":1493.0,"analysis_length":1096.0,"chap_int":3,"previous summary id":["act ii"],"previous chapter":["Act II begins the following morning, as Christy, alone, counts the pub's crockery and glassware. He decides this would be a fine place to call home, and then looks into the wall mirror to confirm that he is indeed a handsome man, as others have recently described him. He notes that he seemed ugly in his home mirror. When he hears some women outside, he quickly hides. Four village girls - Susan Brady, Sara Tansey, Nelly, and Honor Blake - enter. They have heard about Christy, and want to see him for themselves. They soon enough find him hiding, and then shyly offer some presents: duck eggs, butter, cake and a chicken. They flirt with him a bit, and then Widow Quin enters, announcing that she has registered Christy for the sports competition happening down on the beach. The women expect that he will prove a peerless athlete. As the girls and the widow prepare breakfast for him, Christy fleshes out the story of the murder. His father had ordered Christy to marry a fat, ugly widow-woman twice his age. When Christy refused, his father threatened him with a scythe, and Christy in turn threatened his father with a spade. When his father struck at him, Christy feinted and then delivered the fatal blow to the older man's skull. Susan teases that the Lord God has sent Christy to their village to wed the Widow Quin. The widow and Christy link arms, and drink a toast \"to the wonders of the western world\" . Pegeen enters to see the toast, and kicks the women out. She then accuses Christy of flirting, which he denies. He grabs a spade and holds it out to remind her of his great, heroic deed, but she scoffs at him. When he counters that the women were interested in his story, she insinuates that they will gossip about him and hence increase his chances of being apprehended. She then describes in detail a story she read in the paper, about a man recently hanged. The description completely unnerves Christy, who prepares to flee. However, Pegeen calms him down, insisting she was only mocking him, and that she has found no mention of his crime in the paper. He is safe with her. Pegeen and Christy then exchange kind, tender fantasies about the future they might share together. Shawn Keogh runs in with the Widow Quin. Shawn warns Pegeen that her family's sheep are eating cabbage in a neighbor's field, and hence might burst their stomachs. Pegeen runs out to collect her sheep, at which point Shawn offers Christy a one-way ticket to the \"Western States\" , his new hat, his excellent breeches, his new coat, and his blessing if Christy will agree to leave the village. Christy rejects this offer. However, the widow exhorts him to try on the new clothes so he will have something nice to wear for the competition, and Christy accepts. He leaves the room to change clothing. While Christy is gone, Shawn promises Widow Quin a ewe if she can interrupt the burgeoning relationship between Pegeen and the stranger. The widow asks what Shawn would pay if she could get Christy to marry her, and Shawn names just about everything he owns. The deal is struck. Christy parades back in, now wearing Shawn's clothes. After giving his compliments, Shawn races out. Christy continues to prance about, imagining a future of fine clothes and gifts celebrating his triumphant deed. Suddenly, he staggers back, aghast, saying he has seen \"the walking spirit of murdered da\" out the window . Christy hides just as Old Mahon enters. Old Mahon immediately inquires whether the widow has seen a young fellow, whom he has been tracking for ten days. He removes his hat to reveal a vicious, semi-bandaged wound, and then describes the young fellow as his stupid, useless, and dirty son. He further describes the son - Christy, of course - as too weak to drink or smoke a pipe, and as absurdly fearful of women. In fact, Christy is the butt of his own townswomen's jokes. The widow asserts that she has seen a young man who meets the description, but that he has traveled over the hills to catch a steamer. Mahon exits abruptly to chase after this lead. His father gone, Christy wonders why the man pretended to be dead, and wishes a violent death for him now. His venom shocks the widow. Christy then grows suddenly tearful as he imagines losing the new life with Pegeen that he was on the verge of beginning. The widow softly suggests that she and Christy are alike in character, each with a melancholy side that accompanies having killed a close relation. She begins to paint a picture of a tender future they might share together, but Christy hardly hears her, as the sound of the approaching girls interrupts them. Christy begs the widow to help him win Pegeen. She names her terms - \"a right of way I want, and a mountainy ram, and a load of dung at Michaelmas\" - and he agrees . Just like that, Widow Quin relinquishes her own design on Christy, and agrees to keep his secret. If Old Mahon should return, she will swear he is a lunatic. Sarah, Honor and Susan enter to lead Christy down to the beach so he can compete in the sports. Once they leave, Widow Quin reflects that even if his secret is revealed, she will end up with him as husband as consolation, since he will have nobody else to turn to."],"next summary id":"act iii","next chapter":"Later that same day, Jimmy and Philly enter the pub looking for a drink, but neither Pegeen nor her father is there to serve them.

He confesses that the knowledge has made him crazy. The two men rue her wantonness and the infidelity of women in general, but the Cardinal keeps his cool, while chiding Ferdinand for his extreme emotional reactions. Ferdinand threatens everyone--the Duchess, the unknown father, the child, even himself and the Cardinal--and then retires, saying he won't take any action until he figures out who the father is.\", \"analysis\": \"Analysis Act Two shows a new side to the Duchess that will become thematically very important--that of a reproductive figure and mother. This side of her stands in opposition to what her brothers would have her be, which is a monument, chaste, \\\"alabaster,\\\" representing a good reputation and nothing else. When she appears on stage, she is out of breath, and Bosola tells the audience that she Is sick o'days, she pukes, her stomach seethes,The fins of her eyelids look most teeming blue,She wanes i'th' cheek, and waxes fat i'th' flank. He is obsessed with her physicality, and soon afterwards she eats apricots greedily. Considering they have been ripened in horse dung, the apricots stand as a strong image of the Earth, she is now characterized not as \\\"alabaster\\\" or as the untouchable saint Antonio described in Act I, but as a woman very much in touch with the physical Earth. Her love for Antonio and its resulting pregnancy has brought her closer to nature. The Duchess's attempts to hide her pregnancy are a minor example of a theme that is significant in that of disguising, of the contrast between being and seeming. In almost all cases in the play, this theme deals with the disguising of evil, and only with the Duchess and her family is this not the case. Rather, their disguising is necessitated by the evil of the characters around them and the way that eveil has warped the world. So depraved is the world that the truly good characters are forced to disguise their love and domestic bliss to protect them. Bosola himself, who later wears multiple disguises, and as spy is constantly pretending, rails against having to disguise oneself in this act. For instance, he mocks the Old Lady for wearing makeup, leading him to scornfully meditate on how man delights \\\"to hide\\\" his true form \\\"in rich tissue\\\". Immediately after, however, the audience sees his two-faces in stark clarity as he tricks the Duchess into eating apricots while showing his real motivations in his asides. Webster's use of asides, hidden characters, and disguises creates several levels of dramatic irony throughout the play that both raise the dramatic tension and elucidate his pessimistic view of human nature. Superstition is a motif throughout the play, and it is used in Act Two to both foreshadow what is to come and to further develop the characters. At the end of the second scene, Delio says, \\\"How superstitiously we mind our evils\\\" before listing possible bad omens, but though he uses the first person plural, in this case the only character showing superstition is Antonio. In the very next scene, one of the bad omens Delio had just listed comes to pass--Antonio gets a nose bleed. Though he pretends that he is not affected by it, separating himself from \\\"One that were superstitious\\\" , his repeated insistence that \\\"it merely comes by chance\\\" , \\\"mere accident\\\" , shows that he is trying to convince and reassure himself because of how terribly the omen disturbs him. Further, this incident occurs while he is divining a horoscope for his son--another superstitious act. The audience's knowledge that Bosola is a spy on the verge of discovering the Duchess and Antonio's secret makes these superstitions more ominous, but Antonio's superstitious nature itself is not meant to be admired, as it makes him appear weak and highlights his ineffectual nature. This also further distinguishes Antonio's and the Duchess's natures when, later in Act Three, the Duchess calls Cariola a \\\"superstitious fool\\\" , showing her disdain for such things. Act Two takes us from the pregnant Duchess and her worried husband in Malfi, all the way to Rome and the Cardinal's sinful relationship with the married Julia, and finally to the evil brothers' reactions to what they believe is the Duchess's deep shame. This final scene strikingly presents the contrast between the characters, fully clarifying what each brother signifies--the hot-tempered Ferdinand, the cold and calculating Cardinal. Both brothers mention blood and use blood imagery throughout the scene. However, they use it very differently, in ways that represent the difference between their reactions to their sister's behavior. The Cardinal says, \\\"Shall our blood,\/The royal blood of Aragon and Castile,\/Be thus attainted. Here, he means blood metaphorically, as a stand-in for lineage, for family pride and honor, for rank. When Ferdinand speaks of purging \\\"infected blood, such blood as hers\\\" , he is not being figurative--he truly wants to spill her blood. His attitude is further emphasized when he says it is only her \\\"whore's blood\\\" \\\"that shall quench wild-fire\\\". He believes his rage can only be calmed by the spilling of her blood. Fire imagery is connected to Ferdinand throughout the play, and in this scene alone he connects his fire to her blood twice. Earlier, he says that only fire can purge the infection in her blood. These two lines together show that he has already determined she must die--to cure her, his anger must spill her blood, and to cure his anger, her blood must spill. Forgiveness, clearly, is impossible. One is left to wonder about the sexual nature of Ferdinand's intense obsession with his sister, who is his twin. Where the Cardinal - an ambitious man who has used his conniving skills to try and be Pope, according to Antonio - thinks in terms of wealth and Earthly protection, Ferdinand has a moral tone in his disdain for his sister's impurity. Though incest is never mentioned explicitly, it is hardly a rare theme for Jacobean dramatists and can provide an interesting lens into the motivations that drive Ferdinand, as well as a lens into the theme of repression that equally helps understand the Duchess's desire to declare her independence through her marriage\"}","chapter":"Scene V\n\n       [Enter] CARDINAL and FERDINAND with a letter\n\n  FERDINAND.

He confesses that the knowledge has made him crazy. The two men rue her wantonness and the infidelity of women in general, but the Cardinal keeps his cool, while chiding Ferdinand for his extreme emotional reactions. Ferdinand threatens everyone--the Duchess, the unknown father, the child, even himself and the Cardinal--and then retires, saying he won't take any action until he figures out who the father is.","summary_analysis":"Analysis Act Two shows a new side to the Duchess that will become thematically very important--that of a reproductive figure and mother. This side of her stands in opposition to what her brothers would have her be, which is a monument, chaste, \"alabaster,\" representing a good reputation and nothing else. When she appears on stage, she is out of breath, and Bosola tells the audience that she Is sick o'days, she pukes, her stomach seethes,The fins of her eyelids look most teeming blue,She wanes i'th' cheek, and waxes fat i'th' flank. He is obsessed with her physicality, and soon afterwards she eats apricots greedily. Considering they have been ripened in horse dung, the apricots stand as a strong image of the Earth, she is now characterized not as \"alabaster\" or as the untouchable saint Antonio described in Act I, but as a woman very much in touch with the physical Earth. Her love for Antonio and its resulting pregnancy has brought her closer to nature. The Duchess's attempts to hide her pregnancy are a minor example of a theme that is significant in that of disguising, of the contrast between being and seeming. In almost all cases in the play, this theme deals with the disguising of evil, and only with the Duchess and her family is this not the case. Rather, their disguising is necessitated by the evil of the characters around them and the way that eveil has warped the world. So depraved is the world that the truly good characters are forced to disguise their love and domestic bliss to protect them. Bosola himself, who later wears multiple disguises, and as spy is constantly pretending, rails against having to disguise oneself in this act. For instance, he mocks the Old Lady for wearing makeup, leading him to scornfully meditate on how man delights \"to hide\" his true form \"in rich tissue\". Immediately after, however, the audience sees his two-faces in stark clarity as he tricks the Duchess into eating apricots while showing his real motivations in his asides. Webster's use of asides, hidden characters, and disguises creates several levels of dramatic irony throughout the play that both raise the dramatic tension and elucidate his pessimistic view of human nature. Superstition is a motif throughout the play, and it is used in Act Two to both foreshadow what is to come and to further develop the characters. At the end of the second scene, Delio says, \"How superstitiously we mind our evils\" before listing possible bad omens, but though he uses the first person plural, in this case the only character showing superstition is Antonio. In the very next scene, one of the bad omens Delio had just listed comes to pass--Antonio gets a nose bleed. Though he pretends that he is not affected by it, separating himself from \"One that were superstitious\" , his repeated insistence that \"it merely comes by chance\" , \"mere accident\" , shows that he is trying to convince and reassure himself because of how terribly the omen disturbs him. Further, this incident occurs while he is divining a horoscope for his son--another superstitious act. The audience's knowledge that Bosola is a spy on the verge of discovering the Duchess and Antonio's secret makes these superstitions more ominous, but Antonio's superstitious nature itself is not meant to be admired, as it makes him appear weak and highlights his ineffectual nature. This also further distinguishes Antonio's and the Duchess's natures when, later in Act Three, the Duchess calls Cariola a \"superstitious fool\" , showing her disdain for such things. Act Two takes us from the pregnant Duchess and her worried husband in Malfi, all the way to Rome and the Cardinal's sinful relationship with the married Julia, and finally to the evil brothers' reactions to what they believe is the Duchess's deep shame. This final scene strikingly presents the contrast between the characters, fully clarifying what each brother signifies--the hot-tempered Ferdinand, the cold and calculating Cardinal. Both brothers mention blood and use blood imagery throughout the scene. However, they use it very differently, in ways that represent the difference between their reactions to their sister's behavior. The Cardinal says, \"Shall our blood,\/The royal blood of Aragon and Castile,\/Be thus attainted. Here, he means blood metaphorically, as a stand-in for lineage, for family pride and honor, for rank. When Ferdinand speaks of purging \"infected blood, such blood as hers\" , he is not being figurative--he truly wants to spill her blood. His attitude is further emphasized when he says it is only her \"whore's blood\" \"that shall quench wild-fire\". He believes his rage can only be calmed by the spilling of her blood. Fire imagery is connected to Ferdinand throughout the play, and in this scene alone he connects his fire to her blood twice. Earlier, he says that only fire can purge the infection in her blood. These two lines together show that he has already determined she must die--to cure her, his anger must spill her blood, and to cure his anger, her blood must spill. Forgiveness, clearly, is impossible. One is left to wonder about the sexual nature of Ferdinand's intense obsession with his sister, who is his twin. Where the Cardinal - an ambitious man who has used his conniving skills to try and be Pope, according to Antonio - thinks in terms of wealth and Earthly protection, Ferdinand has a moral tone in his disdain for his sister's impurity.

Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. She says she will ask her husband--he doesn't know if she's joking or not--and leaves. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out","Scene Four is set at the Shrine of Our Lady of Loretto. Here, the Cardinal gives up his cardinal's hat in a ceremony so that he can fight as a soldier. Antonio, the Duchess, and their children arrive, and are banished from Ancona. This all happens in pantomime while the churchmen sing a solemn song. They all exit except for two pilgrims, who discuss what happened and explain that the Pope, spurred by the Cardinal, took the Duchess's dukedom from her","Scene Four returns to the residence of the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. The Cardinal tells them not to stay with Ferdinand tonight because having people around makes him worse, although in reality he simply wants to ensure that no one is around when he gets rid of Julia's body. He further tells them of a plan to imitate Ferdinand's insanity in an attempt to get his confidence, and so they should ignore any extreme sounds or cries they might hear. They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. Everyone leaves except the Cardinal. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. The Cardinal exits, and Bosola enters, having overheard the Cardinal's plan to kill him. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally. Before he dies, Bosola tells Antonio what happened to his family. Bosola is devastated by his mistake, and tells the servant to take Antonio's body to Julia's room","We're in Rome. The Cardinal is talking to Castruchio's wife Julia, saying something along the lines of, \"so, what did you tell your husband this time to get yourself out here?\" Wait a second. Ew. Yes, that's right. Julia and the Cardinal. Together. Doing things. Things that are not playing chess or discussing Plato or praying. Yeah. They get into a discussion about infidelity. Topical, no? Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. Gee, what a keeper. A servant comes to tell Julia that Delio and Castruchio have both come to Rome, and that Delio's waiting outside to see her. The Cardinal leaves, and Delio comes in. Turns out Delio used to have a thing for Julia, and the first thing he does is offer Julia money. Wait, what? This is weird. Julia doesn't know what's up, until Delio tells her he'd really appreciate it if she'd become his mistress. You know, when she's not with Castruchio. Julia's either got Victoria's Secret levels of hotness or she's just exceedingly politically convenient. It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess. Julia's admirably quick on the draw: \"Sure, you know what, Delio, I'll get right back to you; lemme go ask my husband what he thinks.\" She leaves Delio alone, who's getting really worried. He hears that the Cardinal is enraged about some letter he's received from Malfi, and fears that somehow Antonio's marriage to the Duchess has been revealed.","We're at Loretto, where Bosola advised the Duchess travel, watching two pilgrims as they watch the Cardinal undergo the ceremony for transforming into a soldier. They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Actually, given that the Duchess is a prince, how can anybody banish her? Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished. The pilgrims still think it's unjust and nasty, especially that part where the Cardinal ripped off her wedding ring.","The Cardinal is making Malateste and Pescara swear that they won't watch over Ferdinand tonight, or come out of their bedrooms even if they hear a ruckus. He says he wants them to stay put because he doesn't want Ferdinand to be bothered at all, but really he just wants to be sure that he can dispose of Julia's body in peace. The Cardinal has arranged for Bosola to come pick up the body, and plans to himself that he's going kill Bosola once he's completed the jobs he's given him. Plans to murder your minions are best kept in your head: Bosola hears him, and knows what's up. Ferdinand the Crazy wanders in and then out, talking to himself. Antonio comes in, saying to himself that he hopes he catches the Cardinal while he's praying, so that maybe he'll be in the mood to forgive him. Bosola, not being able to see that it's Antonio, and, thinking he's some random murder, interprets his words as \"I hope I'll kill that Bosola while he's praying, maybe the Cardinal will pardon me then.\" Quickly, Bosola comes forward and wounds Antonio, only to immediately thereafter discover that it's Antonio, the very guy he was hoping to save. Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered. Why on earth he should tell the dying Antonio that his family is dead when he'd previously lied to the Duchess about the same thing is kind of confusing. Antonio, finally knowing the truth, tells Bosola he just wants to die. He dies, after he voices his final wish that his remaining son be raised away from the courts, and that his body be given to Delio. Basically, nobody can catch a break in this play. Bosola takes his body to where he was supposed to put Julia's body. Quick thing to note: this is the third time the audience has watched Bosola drag a dead body offstage. Just think about that."],"next summary id":"act 2 scene 5","next chapter":"In a different location in the Roman palace, Ferdinand, carrying a letter, tells the Cardinal the news of the Duchess--he knows only that she is pregnant, not that she is married.

The Duchess and Antonio mourn their current state to Cariola, their children, and their last remaining servants. Bosola brings them a letter from Ferdinand, which asks for Antonio to be sent to him, using double-talk so as to threaten his murder while pretending to offer amity. The Duchess sees through his \\\"riddles\\\" easily, and so Antonio refuses to go. Bosola scorns his refusal and leaves. The Duchess, fearful of an ambush, pleads for Antonio to take their oldest son to Milan. He accepts, and they all say their farewells. After Antonio and the older son leave, Bosola and a troop of armed men approach to apprehend the Duchess and her remaining family. Bosola entreats her to forget her lowly husband, but she says that a man's actions, not his rank, are what matter. She and her family are taken back to her palace as prisoners.\", \"analysis\": \"The theme of class becomes most developed here in Act Three. Interestingly, it is first explicitly discussed between Bosola and the Duchess, both of whom are speaking disingenuously in an effort to hide something from the other. They each thus end up acting as the other's mouthpiece on the issue, as when Bosola berates the Duchess for saying of Antonio, \\\"But he was basely descended\\\" , in response to Bosola listing Antonio's virtues, for those virtues, he says, matter more than \\\"men's pedigrees\\\" . The ironic presentation does not mean that the opinions voiced are not honest considerations of the way people approach an individual's status. When, as a result of Bosola's protestations, the Duchess admits that she is married to Antonio, Bosola pretends to be filled with joy and admiration that the Duchess would look past rank and wealth to give a man his true due for his character alone. The audience knows not to trust his effusive praise, of course, but it is worth noting that the final tragedy for the Duchess and her family comes out of this very moment, when Bosola uses this praise of looking beyond rank to get her to admit who her husband is. Yet, as is often true with Bosola, it is impossible to know just how much truth is mixed in with his lies. Once he is alone again on stage, he expresses some reluctance to give his new information to Ferdinand, even though it's the very information he has been trying to get for about two years. This implies that there may have been some truth to his \\\"friendly speech\\\" , especially since his pervasive melancholy is centered on his own inability to improve his position, and now he sees, embodied in Antonio, that it is, in fact, possible to rise past what custom usually dictates. Though this contradiction may indicate that Bosola has some respect for the Duchess's choice in marrying Antonio, he does much to dispel such an interpretation later in the act. For once he has told Ferdinand about Antonio, and so can speak forthrightly without having to lie to try to ensnare the Duchess, he shows much more snobbery about class. For example, when Antonio refuses to act as Ferdinand, through Bosola, wants him to, Bosola says, \\\"This proclaims your breeding\/Every small thing draws a base mind to fear\\\" . Ferdinand is an obviously dangerous figure, and his attempt to get Antonio to come to him has a double, threatening meaning which is barely even hidden. The Duchess, the embodiment of pedigree, is the first to notice this, and yet Bosola would have it that it is only Antonio's lack of breeding that makes him fearful of it. After the sad parting of Antonio and the oldest son with the Duchess and the rest of the children, Bosola comes to take the Duchess into custody. In this powerful scene, Bosola holds up Antonio's rank as reason enough for the Duchess to forget him completely--\\\"Forget this base, low fellow\\\" . This admonition is all the starker in juxtaposition to the sad leave-taking that preceded it, making Bosola's directive, and thus his blind judgment based on rank, seem absurd. When the Duchess responds angrily, he doesn't even bother to use a full sentence in his reply--\\\"One of no birth\\\" --as though his meaning is so obvious that he doesn't even need to declare it.  This leaves the Duchess an opportunity to stand up for Antonio, and for the unimportance of birth, and she does so beautifully, having the last word in the argument for the moment. Though she first defends him positively, explaining that since a man who is great for his own actions, not his birth, is happiest, then the reverse is also true--\\\"So, to great men, the moral may be stretched:\/Men oft are valued high, when th'are most wretch'd\\\" . The fixation on Antonio's rank in the third act, then, becomes also related to question of Ferdinand and the Cardinal's evil. They have the birth, the power, and the standing that Antonio lacks, but they are the symbol of evil throughout the play. Act Three also further elucidates the stark differences between what the Duchess actually is, what Ferdinand believes her to be, and what he wants her to be. The image of the Duchess of a reproductive figure and mother that first came in Act Two is expanded here--one of the first things the audience learns in Act Three is that in what has been only moments in the time of the theater, the Duchess has had two more children--she has been an \\\"excellent\/Feeder of pedigrees\\\" . In the next scene, the domestic bliss of the Duchess's marriage is made clear. The Duchess, Antonio, and Cariola tease each other kindly in the Duchess's bedroom while she prepares to go to bed. The simplicity and easy domestic happiness of this scene create a very different image than all of Ferdinand's imaginings of the Duchess two scenes earlier, when he sees \\\"her in the shameful act of sin\\\"  in his mind, \\\"Haply with some strong thighed bargeman,\/Or one o'th' wood-yard, that can quoit the sledge\\\" . Ferdinand is incapable of imagining her in a loving relationship. If she has had a child, it must have been a product of her uncontrollable lust and resulting promiscuous behavior. The only other option he can imagine for her, that which he wants, is as a monumentalized figure, forever bowing chastely over her first husband's tomb, \\\"cased up, like a holy relic\\\" . The irony is of course that for someone so harshly moral about sex, he is most fixated upon it, again a contradiction that can be seen through a lens of repressed incestuous feelings for his twin. Antonio marks the distinction between this chaste, marble figure the Duchess's brothers would like her to be and the more earthly figure she actually is when talking to Cariola: O fie upon this single life. Forgo it.We read how Daphne, for her peevish flight,Became a fruitless bay-tree; Syrinx turned To the pale empty reed; Anaxarete  Was frozen into marble: whereas those Which married, or proved kind unto their friends, Were, by a gracious influence, transshaped Into the olive, pomegranate, mulberry. The women who remain single are \\\"fruitless,\\\" \\\"pale,\\\" \\\"empty,\\\" \\\"frozen,\\\" \\\"marble,\\\" while the married women become fruit-bearing trees, both beautiful and nourishing to the world around them. This is so preferable to the marble women that Ferdinand and the Cardinal would have, and so far from the lusty widow that they believe the Duchess to be, that their evil against her and her family becomes all the more pronounced. Finally, a word can be said about the inventive theatricality Webster employs to detail the Duchess and Antonio's banishment from Ancona.  Performed as a pantomime dumb-show under a sung hymn, the scene has a great theatrical power both for its economy of storytelling and the irony of pilgrims celebrating through song such a perverse, demented, self-interested line of action.\"}","chapter":"Scene V\n\n       [Enter] DUCHESS, ANTONIO, Children, CARIOLA, and Servants\n\n  DUCHESS.

See, see, like to calm weather\n  At sea before a tempest, false hearts speak fair\n  To those they intend most mischief.\n  [Reads.] 'Send Antonio to me; I want his head in a business.'\n  A politic equivocation!\n  He doth not want your counsel, but your head;\n  That is, he cannot sleep till you be dead.\n  And here 's another pitfall that 's strew'd o'er\n  With roses; mark it, 'tis a cunning one:\n       [Reads.]\n    'I stand engaged for your husband for several debts at Naples:\n    let not that trouble him; I had rather have his heart than his\n    money':--\n  And I believe so too.\n\n  BOSOLA.                What do you believe?\n\n  DUCHESS.  That he so much distrusts my husband's love,\n  He will by no means believe his heart is with him\n  Until he see it:  the devil is not cunning enough\n  To circumvent us In riddles.\n\n  BOSOLA.  Will you reject that noble and free league\n  Of amity and love which I present you?\n\n  DUCHESS.  Their league is like that of some politic kings,\n  Only to make themselves of strength and power\n  To be our after-ruin; tell them so.\n\n  BOSOLA.  And what from you?\n\n  ANTONIO.                     Thus tell him; I will not come.\n\n  BOSOLA.  And what of this?\n\n  ANTONIO.

I suspect some ambush;\n  Therefore by all my love I do conjure you\n  To take your eldest son, and fly towards Milan.\n  Let us not venture all this poor remainder\n  In one unlucky bottom.\n\n  ANTONIO.                You counsel safely.\n  Best of my life, farewell.  Since we must part,\n  Heaven hath a hand in 't; but no otherwise\n  Than as some curious artist takes in sunder\n  A clock or watch, when it is out of frame,\n  To bring 't in better order.\n\n  DUCHESS.  I know not which is best,\n  To see you dead, or part with you.--Farewell, boy:\n  Thou art happy that thou hast not understanding\n  To know thy misery; for all our wit\n  And reading brings us to a truer sense\n  Of sorrow.--In the eternal church, sir,\n  I do hope we shall not part thus.\n\n  ANTONIO.                           O, be of comfort!\n  Make patience a noble fortitude,\n  And think not how unkindly we are us'd:\n  Man, like to cassia, is prov'd best, being bruis'd.\n\n  DUCHESS.  Must I, like to slave-born Russian,\n  Account it praise to suffer tyranny?\n  And yet, O heaven, thy heavy hand is in 't!\n  I have seen my little boy oft scourge his top,\n  And compar'd myself to 't:  naught made me e'er\n  Go right but heaven's scourge-stick.\n\n  ANTONIO.                              Do not weep:\n  Heaven fashion'd us of nothing; and we strive\n  To bring ourselves to nothing.--Farewell, Cariola,\n  And thy sweet armful.--If I do never see thee more,\n  Be a good mother to your little ones,\n  And save them from the tiger:  fare you well.\n\n  DUCHESS.  Let me look upon you once more, for that speech\n  Came from a dying father.  Your kiss is colder\n  Than that I have seen an holy anchorite\n  Give to a dead man's skull.\n\n  ANTONIO.  My heart is turn'd to a heavy lump of lead,\n  With which I sound my danger:  fare you well.\n       Exeunt [ANTONIO and his son.]\n\n  DUCHESS.  My laurel is all withered.\n\n  CARIOLA.  Look, madam, what a troop of armed men\n  Make toward us!\n\n       Re-enter BOSOLA [visarded,] with a Guard\n\n  DUCHESS.         O, they are very welcome:\n  When Fortune's wheel is over-charg'd with princes,\n  The weight makes it move swift:  I would have my ruin\n  Be sudden.--I am your adventure, am I not?\n\n  BOSOLA.

The Duchess and Antonio mourn their current state to Cariola, their children, and their last remaining servants. Bosola brings them a letter from Ferdinand, which asks for Antonio to be sent to him, using double-talk so as to threaten his murder while pretending to offer amity. The Duchess sees through his \"riddles\" easily, and so Antonio refuses to go. Bosola scorns his refusal and leaves. The Duchess, fearful of an ambush, pleads for Antonio to take their oldest son to Milan. He accepts, and they all say their farewells. After Antonio and the older son leave, Bosola and a troop of armed men approach to apprehend the Duchess and her remaining family. Bosola entreats her to forget her lowly husband, but she says that a man's actions, not his rank, are what matter. She and her family are taken back to her palace as prisoners.","summary_analysis":"The theme of class becomes most developed here in Act Three. Interestingly, it is first explicitly discussed between Bosola and the Duchess, both of whom are speaking disingenuously in an effort to hide something from the other. They each thus end up acting as the other's mouthpiece on the issue, as when Bosola berates the Duchess for saying of Antonio, \"But he was basely descended\" , in response to Bosola listing Antonio's virtues, for those virtues, he says, matter more than \"men's pedigrees\" . The ironic presentation does not mean that the opinions voiced are not honest considerations of the way people approach an individual's status. When, as a result of Bosola's protestations, the Duchess admits that she is married to Antonio, Bosola pretends to be filled with joy and admiration that the Duchess would look past rank and wealth to give a man his true due for his character alone. The audience knows not to trust his effusive praise, of course, but it is worth noting that the final tragedy for the Duchess and her family comes out of this very moment, when Bosola uses this praise of looking beyond rank to get her to admit who her husband is. Yet, as is often true with Bosola, it is impossible to know just how much truth is mixed in with his lies. Once he is alone again on stage, he expresses some reluctance to give his new information to Ferdinand, even though it's the very information he has been trying to get for about two years. This implies that there may have been some truth to his \"friendly speech\" , especially since his pervasive melancholy is centered on his own inability to improve his position, and now he sees, embodied in Antonio, that it is, in fact, possible to rise past what custom usually dictates. Though this contradiction may indicate that Bosola has some respect for the Duchess's choice in marrying Antonio, he does much to dispel such an interpretation later in the act. For once he has told Ferdinand about Antonio, and so can speak forthrightly without having to lie to try to ensnare the Duchess, he shows much more snobbery about class. For example, when Antonio refuses to act as Ferdinand, through Bosola, wants him to, Bosola says, \"This proclaims your breeding\/Every small thing draws a base mind to fear\" . Ferdinand is an obviously dangerous figure, and his attempt to get Antonio to come to him has a double, threatening meaning which is barely even hidden. The Duchess, the embodiment of pedigree, is the first to notice this, and yet Bosola would have it that it is only Antonio's lack of breeding that makes him fearful of it. After the sad parting of Antonio and the oldest son with the Duchess and the rest of the children, Bosola comes to take the Duchess into custody. In this powerful scene, Bosola holds up Antonio's rank as reason enough for the Duchess to forget him completely--\"Forget this base, low fellow\" . This admonition is all the starker in juxtaposition to the sad leave-taking that preceded it, making Bosola's directive, and thus his blind judgment based on rank, seem absurd. When the Duchess responds angrily, he doesn't even bother to use a full sentence in his reply--\"One of no birth\" --as though his meaning is so obvious that he doesn't even need to declare it.  This leaves the Duchess an opportunity to stand up for Antonio, and for the unimportance of birth, and she does so beautifully, having the last word in the argument for the moment. Though she first defends him positively, explaining that since a man who is great for his own actions, not his birth, is happiest, then the reverse is also true--\"So, to great men, the moral may be stretched:\/Men oft are valued high, when th'are most wretch'd\" . The fixation on Antonio's rank in the third act, then, becomes also related to question of Ferdinand and the Cardinal's evil. They have the birth, the power, and the standing that Antonio lacks, but they are the symbol of evil throughout the play. Act Three also further elucidates the stark differences between what the Duchess actually is, what Ferdinand believes her to be, and what he wants her to be. The image of the Duchess of a reproductive figure and mother that first came in Act Two is expanded here--one of the first things the audience learns in Act Three is that in what has been only moments in the time of the theater, the Duchess has had two more children--she has been an \"excellent\/Feeder of pedigrees\" . In the next scene, the domestic bliss of the Duchess's marriage is made clear. The Duchess, Antonio, and Cariola tease each other kindly in the Duchess's bedroom while she prepares to go to bed. The simplicity and easy domestic happiness of this scene create a very different image than all of Ferdinand's imaginings of the Duchess two scenes earlier, when he sees \"her in the shameful act of sin\"  in his mind, \"Haply with some strong thighed bargeman,\/Or one o'th' wood-yard, that can quoit the sledge\" . Ferdinand is incapable of imagining her in a loving relationship. If she has had a child, it must have been a product of her uncontrollable lust and resulting promiscuous behavior. The only other option he can imagine for her, that which he wants, is as a monumentalized figure, forever bowing chastely over her first husband's tomb, \"cased up, like a holy relic\" . The irony is of course that for someone so harshly moral about sex, he is most fixated upon it, again a contradiction that can be seen through a lens of repressed incestuous feelings for his twin. Antonio marks the distinction between this chaste, marble figure the Duchess's brothers would like her to be and the more earthly figure she actually is when talking to Cariola: O fie upon this single life. Forgo it.We read how Daphne, for her peevish flight,Became a fruitless bay-tree; Syrinx turned To the pale empty reed; Anaxarete  Was frozen into marble: whereas those Which married, or proved kind unto their friends, Were, by a gracious influence, transshaped Into the olive, pomegranate, mulberry. The women who remain single are \"fruitless,\" \"pale,\" \"empty,\" \"frozen,\" \"marble,\" while the married women become fruit-bearing trees, both beautiful and nourishing to the world around them. This is so preferable to the marble women that Ferdinand and the Cardinal would have, and so far from the lusty widow that they believe the Duchess to be, that their evil against her and her family becomes all the more pronounced. Finally, a word can be said about the inventive theatricality Webster employs to detail the Duchess and Antonio's banishment from Ancona.  Performed as a pantomime dumb-show under a sung hymn, the scene has a great theatrical power both for its economy of storytelling and the irony of pilgrims celebrating through song such a perverse, demented, self-interested line of action.","summary_length":154.0,"analysis_length":1170.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["act 2 scene 4","act 3 scene 4","act 5 scene 4","act 2, scene 4","act 3, scene 4","act 5, scene 4"],"previous chapter":["At the Cardinal's palace in Rome, Julia, the Cardinal's mistress and Castruccio's wife, explains how she convinced her husband to let her go to Rome without him. Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. She says she will ask her husband--he doesn't know if she's joking or not--and leaves. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out","Scene Four is set at the Shrine of Our Lady of Loretto. Here, the Cardinal gives up his cardinal's hat in a ceremony so that he can fight as a soldier. Antonio, the Duchess, and their children arrive, and are banished from Ancona. This all happens in pantomime while the churchmen sing a solemn song. They all exit except for two pilgrims, who discuss what happened and explain that the Pope, spurred by the Cardinal, took the Duchess's dukedom from her","Scene Four returns to the residence of the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. The Cardinal tells them not to stay with Ferdinand tonight because having people around makes him worse, although in reality he simply wants to ensure that no one is around when he gets rid of Julia's body. He further tells them of a plan to imitate Ferdinand's insanity in an attempt to get his confidence, and so they should ignore any extreme sounds or cries they might hear. They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. Everyone leaves except the Cardinal. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. The Cardinal exits, and Bosola enters, having overheard the Cardinal's plan to kill him. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally. Before he dies, Bosola tells Antonio what happened to his family. Bosola is devastated by his mistake, and tells the servant to take Antonio's body to Julia's room","We're in Rome. The Cardinal is talking to Castruchio's wife Julia, saying something along the lines of, \"so, what did you tell your husband this time to get yourself out here?\" Wait a second. Ew. Yes, that's right. Julia and the Cardinal. Together. Doing things. Things that are not playing chess or discussing Plato or praying. Yeah. They get into a discussion about infidelity. Topical, no? Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. Gee, what a keeper. A servant comes to tell Julia that Delio and Castruchio have both come to Rome, and that Delio's waiting outside to see her. The Cardinal leaves, and Delio comes in. Turns out Delio used to have a thing for Julia, and the first thing he does is offer Julia money. Wait, what? This is weird. Julia doesn't know what's up, until Delio tells her he'd really appreciate it if she'd become his mistress. You know, when she's not with Castruchio. Julia's either got Victoria's Secret levels of hotness or she's just exceedingly politically convenient. It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess. Julia's admirably quick on the draw: \"Sure, you know what, Delio, I'll get right back to you; lemme go ask my husband what he thinks.\" She leaves Delio alone, who's getting really worried. He hears that the Cardinal is enraged about some letter he's received from Malfi, and fears that somehow Antonio's marriage to the Duchess has been revealed.","We're at Loretto, where Bosola advised the Duchess travel, watching two pilgrims as they watch the Cardinal undergo the ceremony for transforming into a soldier. They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Actually, given that the Duchess is a prince, how can anybody banish her? Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished. The pilgrims still think it's unjust and nasty, especially that part where the Cardinal ripped off her wedding ring.","The Cardinal is making Malateste and Pescara swear that they won't watch over Ferdinand tonight, or come out of their bedrooms even if they hear a ruckus. He says he wants them to stay put because he doesn't want Ferdinand to be bothered at all, but really he just wants to be sure that he can dispose of Julia's body in peace. The Cardinal has arranged for Bosola to come pick up the body, and plans to himself that he's going kill Bosola once he's completed the jobs he's given him. Plans to murder your minions are best kept in your head: Bosola hears him, and knows what's up. Ferdinand the Crazy wanders in and then out, talking to himself. Antonio comes in, saying to himself that he hopes he catches the Cardinal while he's praying, so that maybe he'll be in the mood to forgive him. Bosola, not being able to see that it's Antonio, and, thinking he's some random murder, interprets his words as \"I hope I'll kill that Bosola while he's praying, maybe the Cardinal will pardon me then.\" Quickly, Bosola comes forward and wounds Antonio, only to immediately thereafter discover that it's Antonio, the very guy he was hoping to save. Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered. Why on earth he should tell the dying Antonio that his family is dead when he'd previously lied to the Duchess about the same thing is kind of confusing. Antonio, finally knowing the truth, tells Bosola he just wants to die. He dies, after he voices his final wish that his remaining son be raised away from the courts, and that his body be given to Delio. Basically, nobody can catch a break in this play. Bosola takes his body to where he was supposed to put Julia's body. Quick thing to note: this is the third time the audience has watched Bosola drag a dead body offstage. Just think about that."],"next summary id":"act 3 scene 5","next chapter":"Scene Five takes place nearby Loretto, following the banishment.

Delio enters with the eldest son of Antonio and the Duchess's marriage, the sole survivor of the family, and the men pledge to help give him a good life to honor his mother and father.\", \"analysis\": \"The Duchess is unquestionably the heroine of The Duchess of Malfi, so many critics have questioned Webster's choice to have her tragic, heroic death scene in the fourth act rather than the fifth. This placement leaves room for the play's themes to be tied up, and for the tragic destruction of the Duchess and her family to be avenged through Bosola, who in this act finally gets to fight on the side of the good that he claimed to have had inside him all along.  In many ways, this structure suggests that Bosola is the central figure of the play.  Validating this claim is the fact that Webster listed Bosola first in the cast list, a rather rare occurrence in the day for characters of low rank. The opening lines of the act underscore Antonio's weakness. He does not yet know that his wife and two of his children are dead, but the audience has just seen them tragically murdered, so when he asks, \\\"What think you of my hope of reconcilement\/To the Aragonian brethren\\\" , the dramatic irony paints him as not only only naive but horrifically callous. In his insistence on meeting with the Cardinal to beg peace, his ultimate ineffectiveness as a husband and father and protector of his family is made brutally clear, and the fact that even his death is no more than a tragic accident shows how he has never really been more than a frame to the vivacity, power, and courage of the Duchess.  None of this is meant to negate his honor and goodness, but rather to suggest the ineffectiveness of such virtues in a world this corrupt. This act also reveals the cracks in the seemingly all powerful Cardinal's strength. He represents cold, calculating, removed evil, having managed to exert his will throughout the play while keeping his hands clean, and as such he has seemed indomitable. This illusion has been maintained partially by his brief presence on stage in the previous acts--he usually comes on, has a few lines and directives, and goes off again. In Act Five, however, he is more present, and he fails to maintain control when exposed for longer periods of time. His first mistake is to believe that he can still control Bosola with the promise of rewards to come but never intended, as he and his brother have done all along. Though Bosola does accidentally kill Antonio, as the Cardinal wished, it was the opposite of his intent, and the Cardinal's trust allows him to access the Cardinal alone and so kill him. The Cardinal also overestimates Julia's love for him, and underestimates her cunning, and thereby exposes the secret that gives the hidden Bosola imperative to put the final chain of events in motion. These mistakes, and the fact that he signs his own death warrant in his schemes to keep the courtiers from coming to his chamber, show that his Machiavellian scheming is in fact short-sighted and fallible. The Cardinal and Ferdinand both, on different scales, show the destructive power that evil ultimately has on the very perpetrators of that evil. With Ferdinand, this is very obvious. Though he has shown some small signs of madness all along, and certainly irrationality, in the fifth act, he is completely undone, fighting his own shadow and digging up corpses, believing himself to be a wolf. Though there is foreshadowing of this lycanthropia throughout the play, the real turning point comes when Ferdinand is faced with the face of his sister's corpse. Her goodness, and the price she paid because of his evil, is too much for him, and he goes off to hunt a badger--clearly an indication that his total loss of sanity has begun.  One can also understand this from a psychological standpoint - if we think of his intense hatred of his sister's sexuality as symptomatic of repressed incestuous feeling, then his insanity here represents a transference of those perverted feelings once she has died and can no longer serve as a receptacle for his displaced feelings. For the Cardinal, his self-destruction is more subtle, but still distinct. Besides the chips in his facade already mentioned and the mistakes that allow Bosola to kill him, in the last scene his spirit is diminished. The scene opens with him fearing hell, and what it has in store for him, and for the first time he shows signs of guilt for all of the evil he has done. In stark opposition to the Duchess and her calm, dignified death, he cries for help repeatedly as he is attacked. Bosola tells him, \\\"Now it seems thy greatness was only outward,\/For thou fall'st faster of thyself than calamity\/Can drive thee\\\" , and this is reflected in his powerlessness to draw aid, to help himself, and in his final, melancholic plea to \\\"Be laid by, and never thought of\\\" . The pattern of death in Act Five is utterly distinct from that in Act Four, further cementing the image of the courageous Duchess. The Duchess gets a long lead up, elaborate rituals, and her body is left isolated on the stage to set her apart, not to mention the courage and dignity with which she faces her executioners, and the hope with which she looks to the afterlife. In Act Five, however, Antonio dies in a case of mistaken identity, the Cardinal calls uselessly for help while both Bosola and Ferdinand attack him, Ferdinand gives Bosola his death blow seemingly at random--all is chaos, cowardice, and hopelessness in the face of death.  For she who lived her life virtuously and in pursuit of her own happiness, a dignified death in possible.  For most of us, who it seems Webster believes would live our lives mired in self-interest, deception, and cruelty, death will come in an undignified manner. Though the play is mostly overwrought with evil, it does end on a hopeful note. One member of the Duchess's family survives, her and Antonio's oldest son. The representatives of evil have all destroyed each other, and \\\"These wretched eminent things\/Leave no more fame behind 'em than should one\/Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow\\\"  which will melt in the sun. They can do no more harm from beyond the grave, but though the Duchess is also dead, she can do good, for it is in the Duchess's \\\"right\\\"  that Delio and the surviving gentlemen intend to raise the son, this symbol of hope, who the Duchess and Antonio created in and left as a testament to their love.  The only dark spot on this otherwise hopeful ending is the worldview that Webster paints so vividly, one where evil and human self-interest is the status quo, and so even what starts pure has the potential to grow corrupt.\"}","chapter":"Scene V\n\n       [Enter] CARDINAL, with a book\n\n  CARDINAL.

This placement leaves room for the play's themes to be tied up, and for the tragic destruction of the Duchess and her family to be avenged through Bosola, who in this act finally gets to fight on the side of the good that he claimed to have had inside him all along.  In many ways, this structure suggests that Bosola is the central figure of the play.  Validating this claim is the fact that Webster listed Bosola first in the cast list, a rather rare occurrence in the day for characters of low rank. The opening lines of the act underscore Antonio's weakness. He does not yet know that his wife and two of his children are dead, but the audience has just seen them tragically murdered, so when he asks, \"What think you of my hope of reconcilement\/To the Aragonian brethren\" , the dramatic irony paints him as not only only naive but horrifically callous. In his insistence on meeting with the Cardinal to beg peace, his ultimate ineffectiveness as a husband and father and protector of his family is made brutally clear, and the fact that even his death is no more than a tragic accident shows how he has never really been more than a frame to the vivacity, power, and courage of the Duchess.  None of this is meant to negate his honor and goodness, but rather to suggest the ineffectiveness of such virtues in a world this corrupt. This act also reveals the cracks in the seemingly all powerful Cardinal's strength. He represents cold, calculating, removed evil, having managed to exert his will throughout the play while keeping his hands clean, and as such he has seemed indomitable. This illusion has been maintained partially by his brief presence on stage in the previous acts--he usually comes on, has a few lines and directives, and goes off again. In Act Five, however, he is more present, and he fails to maintain control when exposed for longer periods of time. His first mistake is to believe that he can still control Bosola with the promise of rewards to come but never intended, as he and his brother have done all along. Though Bosola does accidentally kill Antonio, as the Cardinal wished, it was the opposite of his intent, and the Cardinal's trust allows him to access the Cardinal alone and so kill him. The Cardinal also overestimates Julia's love for him, and underestimates her cunning, and thereby exposes the secret that gives the hidden Bosola imperative to put the final chain of events in motion. These mistakes, and the fact that he signs his own death warrant in his schemes to keep the courtiers from coming to his chamber, show that his Machiavellian scheming is in fact short-sighted and fallible. The Cardinal and Ferdinand both, on different scales, show the destructive power that evil ultimately has on the very perpetrators of that evil. With Ferdinand, this is very obvious. Though he has shown some small signs of madness all along, and certainly irrationality, in the fifth act, he is completely undone, fighting his own shadow and digging up corpses, believing himself to be a wolf. Though there is foreshadowing of this lycanthropia throughout the play, the real turning point comes when Ferdinand is faced with the face of his sister's corpse. Her goodness, and the price she paid because of his evil, is too much for him, and he goes off to hunt a badger--clearly an indication that his total loss of sanity has begun.  One can also understand this from a psychological standpoint - if we think of his intense hatred of his sister's sexuality as symptomatic of repressed incestuous feeling, then his insanity here represents a transference of those perverted feelings once she has died and can no longer serve as a receptacle for his displaced feelings. For the Cardinal, his self-destruction is more subtle, but still distinct. Besides the chips in his facade already mentioned and the mistakes that allow Bosola to kill him, in the last scene his spirit is diminished. The scene opens with him fearing hell, and what it has in store for him, and for the first time he shows signs of guilt for all of the evil he has done. In stark opposition to the Duchess and her calm, dignified death, he cries for help repeatedly as he is attacked. Bosola tells him, \"Now it seems thy greatness was only outward,\/For thou fall'st faster of thyself than calamity\/Can drive thee\" , and this is reflected in his powerlessness to draw aid, to help himself, and in his final, melancholic plea to \"Be laid by, and never thought of\" . The pattern of death in Act Five is utterly distinct from that in Act Four, further cementing the image of the courageous Duchess. The Duchess gets a long lead up, elaborate rituals, and her body is left isolated on the stage to set her apart, not to mention the courage and dignity with which she faces her executioners, and the hope with which she looks to the afterlife. In Act Five, however, Antonio dies in a case of mistaken identity, the Cardinal calls uselessly for help while both Bosola and Ferdinand attack him, Ferdinand gives Bosola his death blow seemingly at random--all is chaos, cowardice, and hopelessness in the face of death.  For she who lived her life virtuously and in pursuit of her own happiness, a dignified death in possible.  For most of us, who it seems Webster believes would live our lives mired in self-interest, deception, and cruelty, death will come in an undignified manner. Though the play is mostly overwrought with evil, it does end on a hopeful note. One member of the Duchess's family survives, her and Antonio's oldest son. The representatives of evil have all destroyed each other, and \"These wretched eminent things\/Leave no more fame behind 'em than should one\/Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow\"  which will melt in the sun. They can do no more harm from beyond the grave, but though the Duchess is also dead, she can do good, for it is in the Duchess's \"right\"  that Delio and the surviving gentlemen intend to raise the son, this symbol of hope, who the Duchess and Antonio created in and left as a testament to their love.  The only dark spot on this otherwise hopeful ending is the worldview that Webster paints so vividly, one where evil and human self-interest is the status quo, and so even what starts pure has the potential to grow corrupt.","summary_length":251.0,"analysis_length":1140.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["act 2 scene 4","act 3 scene 4","act 5 scene 4","act 2, scene 4","act 3, scene 4","act 5, scene 4"],"previous chapter":["At the Cardinal's palace in Rome, Julia, the Cardinal's mistress and Castruccio's wife, explains how she convinced her husband to let her go to Rome without him. Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. She says she will ask her husband--he doesn't know if she's joking or not--and leaves.

They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. Everyone leaves except the Cardinal. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. The Cardinal exits, and Bosola enters, having overheard the Cardinal's plan to kill him. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally.

Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. Gee, what a keeper. A servant comes to tell Julia that Delio and Castruchio have both come to Rome, and that Delio's waiting outside to see her. The Cardinal leaves, and Delio comes in. Turns out Delio used to have a thing for Julia, and the first thing he does is offer Julia money. Wait, what? This is weird. Julia doesn't know what's up, until Delio tells her he'd really appreciate it if she'd become his mistress. You know, when she's not with Castruchio. Julia's either got Victoria's Secret levels of hotness or she's just exceedingly politically convenient. It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess. Julia's admirably quick on the draw: \"Sure, you know what, Delio, I'll get right back to you; lemme go ask my husband what he thinks.\" She leaves Delio alone, who's getting really worried. He hears that the Cardinal is enraged about some letter he's received from Malfi, and fears that somehow Antonio's marriage to the Duchess has been revealed.","We're at Loretto, where Bosola advised the Duchess travel, watching two pilgrims as they watch the Cardinal undergo the ceremony for transforming into a soldier. They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Actually, given that the Duchess is a prince, how can anybody banish her? Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished. The pilgrims still think it's unjust and nasty, especially that part where the Cardinal ripped off her wedding ring.","The Cardinal is making Malateste and Pescara swear that they won't watch over Ferdinand tonight, or come out of their bedrooms even if they hear a ruckus. He says he wants them to stay put because he doesn't want Ferdinand to be bothered at all, but really he just wants to be sure that he can dispose of Julia's body in peace. The Cardinal has arranged for Bosola to come pick up the body, and plans to himself that he's going kill Bosola once he's completed the jobs he's given him. Plans to murder your minions are best kept in your head: Bosola hears him, and knows what's up. Ferdinand the Crazy wanders in and then out, talking to himself. Antonio comes in, saying to himself that he hopes he catches the Cardinal while he's praying, so that maybe he'll be in the mood to forgive him. Bosola, not being able to see that it's Antonio, and, thinking he's some random murder, interprets his words as \"I hope I'll kill that Bosola while he's praying, maybe the Cardinal will pardon me then.\" Quickly, Bosola comes forward and wounds Antonio, only to immediately thereafter discover that it's Antonio, the very guy he was hoping to save. Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered. Why on earth he should tell the dying Antonio that his family is dead when he'd previously lied to the Duchess about the same thing is kind of confusing. Antonio, finally knowing the truth, tells Bosola he just wants to die. He dies, after he voices his final wish that his remaining son be raised away from the courts, and that his body be given to Delio. Basically, nobody can catch a break in this play. Bosola takes his body to where he was supposed to put Julia's body. Quick thing to note: this is the third time the audience has watched Bosola drag a dead body offstage. Just think about that."],"next summary id":"act 5 scene 5","next chapter":"The final scene is set in a different chamber in the same Milan residence. The Cardinal enters, debating to himself the nature of hell and wondering aloud \"how tedious is a guilty conscience. Bosola enters, followed by a servant who carries Antonio's body. Bosola tells the Cardinal that he has come to kill him, and though the Cardinal first tries to call for help, then to bribe Bosola to let him live, but Bosola is determined. Above, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan hear the Cardinal's cries for help, but they think he is testing them as he told them he might, so they don't go to him, except for Pescara, who thinks he sounds truly in trouble. The others follow because they want to see Pescara humiliated. Bosola tells the Cardinal that he is going to kill him to avenge the Duchess and Antonio's deaths, and then stabs him. The Cardinal continues to call for help. Ferdinand comes in and, not understanding the situation, wounds the Cardinal further, after which he stabs Bosola. Bosola kills Ferdinand. Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. Bosola explains why he has killed Ferdinand and the Cardinal, but the Cardinal blames Ferdinand for their sister's death before he dies. Bosola explains that he killed Antonio accidentally, and then he too dies. Delio enters with the eldest son of Antonio and the Duchess's marriage, the sole survivor of the family, and the men pledge to help give him a good life to honor his mother and father."}

Lower!\n  Rogues do not whisper 't now, but seek to publish 't\n  (As servants do the bounty of their lords)\n  Aloud; and with a covetous searching eye,\n  To mark who note them.  O, confusion seize her!\n  She hath had most cunning bawds to serve her turn,\n  And more secure conveyances for lust\n  Than towns of garrison for service.\n\n  CARDINAL.                            Is 't possible?\n  Can this be certain?\n\n  FERDINAND.            Rhubarb, O, for rhubarb\n  To purge this choler!  Here 's the cursed day\n  To prompt my memory; and here 't shall stick\n  Till of her bleeding heart I make a sponge\n  To wipe it out.\n\n  CARDINAL.        Why do you make yourself\n  So wild a tempest?\n\n  FERDINAND.          Would I could be one,\n  That I might toss her palace 'bout her ears,\n  Root up her goodly forests, blast her meads,\n  And lay her general territory as waste\n  As she hath done her honours.\n\n  CARDINAL.                      Shall our blood,\n  The royal blood of Arragon and Castile,\n  Be thus attainted?\n\n  FERDINAND.          Apply desperate physic:\n  We must not now use balsamum, but fire,\n  The smarting cupping-glass, for that 's the mean\n  To purge infected blood, such blood as hers.\n  There is a kind of pity in mine eye,--\n  I 'll give it to my handkercher; and now 'tis here,\n  I 'll bequeath this to her bastard.\n\n  CARDINAL.                            What to do?\n\n  FERDINAND.  Why, to make soft lint for his mother's wounds,\n  When I have hew'd her to pieces.\n\n  CARDINAL.                         Curs'd creature!\n  Unequal nature, to place women's hearts\n  So far upon the left side![69]\n\n  FERDINAND.                  Foolish men,\n  That e'er will trust their honour in a bark\n  Made of so slight weak bulrush as is woman,\n  Apt every minute to sink it!\n\n  CARDINAL.  Thus ignorance, when it hath purchas'd honour,\n  It cannot wield it.\n\n  FERDINAND.           Methinks I see her laughing,--\n  Excellent hyena!

Happily with some strong-thigh'd bargeman,\n  Or one o' th' wood-yard that can quoit the sledge[70]\n  Or toss the bar, or else some lovely squire\n  That carries coals up to her privy lodgings.\n\n  CARDINAL.

How idly shows this rage, which carries you,\n  As men convey'd by witches through the air,\n  On violent whirlwinds!  This intemperate noise\n  Fitly resembles deaf men's shrill discourse,\n  Who talk aloud, thinking all other men\n  To have their imperfection.\n\n  FERDINAND.                   Have not you\n  My palsy?\n\n  CARDINAL.    Yes, [but] I can be angry\n  Without this rupture.  There is not in nature\n  A thing that makes man so deform'd, so beastly,\n  As doth intemperate anger.

So I will only study to seem\n  The thing I am not.  I could kill her now,\n  In you, or in myself; for I do think\n  It is some sin in us heaven doth revenge\n  By her.\n\n  CARDINAL.  Are you stark mad?\n\n  FERDINAND.                     I would have their bodies\n  Burnt in a coal-pit with the ventage stopp'd,\n  That their curs'd smoke might not ascend to heaven;\n  Or dip the sheets they lie in in pitch or sulphur,\n  Wrap them in 't, and then light them like a match;\n  Or else to-boil[71] their bastard to a cullis,\n  And give 't his lecherous father to renew\n  The sin of his back.\n\n  CARDINAL.

In, in; I 'll go sleep.\n  Till I know who [loves] my sister, I 'll not stir:\n  That known, I 'll find scorpions to string my whips,\n  And fix her in a general eclipse.\n       Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":1256.0,"summary_name":"Act 2, Scene 5","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201219184023\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/the-duchess-of-malfi\/summary\/act-2-scene-5","summary_text":"Ferdinand's talking to the Cardinal, and boy is he not a happy camper.

Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. She says she will ask her husband--he doesn't know if she's joking or not--and leaves. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out","Scene Four is set at the Shrine of Our Lady of Loretto. Here, the Cardinal gives up his cardinal's hat in a ceremony so that he can fight as a soldier. Antonio, the Duchess, and their children arrive, and are banished from Ancona. This all happens in pantomime while the churchmen sing a solemn song. They all exit except for two pilgrims, who discuss what happened and explain that the Pope, spurred by the Cardinal, took the Duchess's dukedom from her","Scene Four returns to the residence of the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. The Cardinal tells them not to stay with Ferdinand tonight because having people around makes him worse, although in reality he simply wants to ensure that no one is around when he gets rid of Julia's body. He further tells them of a plan to imitate Ferdinand's insanity in an attempt to get his confidence, and so they should ignore any extreme sounds or cries they might hear. They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. Everyone leaves except the Cardinal. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. The Cardinal exits, and Bosola enters, having overheard the Cardinal's plan to kill him. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally. Before he dies, Bosola tells Antonio what happened to his family. Bosola is devastated by his mistake, and tells the servant to take Antonio's body to Julia's room","We're in Rome. The Cardinal is talking to Castruchio's wife Julia, saying something along the lines of, \"so, what did you tell your husband this time to get yourself out here?\" Wait a second. Ew. Yes, that's right. Julia and the Cardinal. Together. Doing things. Things that are not playing chess or discussing Plato or praying. Yeah. They get into a discussion about infidelity. Topical, no? Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. Gee, what a keeper. A servant comes to tell Julia that Delio and Castruchio have both come to Rome, and that Delio's waiting outside to see her. The Cardinal leaves, and Delio comes in. Turns out Delio used to have a thing for Julia, and the first thing he does is offer Julia money. Wait, what? This is weird. Julia doesn't know what's up, until Delio tells her he'd really appreciate it if she'd become his mistress. You know, when she's not with Castruchio. Julia's either got Victoria's Secret levels of hotness or she's just exceedingly politically convenient. It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess. Julia's admirably quick on the draw: \"Sure, you know what, Delio, I'll get right back to you; lemme go ask my husband what he thinks.\" She leaves Delio alone, who's getting really worried. He hears that the Cardinal is enraged about some letter he's received from Malfi, and fears that somehow Antonio's marriage to the Duchess has been revealed.","We're at Loretto, where Bosola advised the Duchess travel, watching two pilgrims as they watch the Cardinal undergo the ceremony for transforming into a soldier. They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Actually, given that the Duchess is a prince, how can anybody banish her? Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished. The pilgrims still think it's unjust and nasty, especially that part where the Cardinal ripped off her wedding ring.","The Cardinal is making Malateste and Pescara swear that they won't watch over Ferdinand tonight, or come out of their bedrooms even if they hear a ruckus. He says he wants them to stay put because he doesn't want Ferdinand to be bothered at all, but really he just wants to be sure that he can dispose of Julia's body in peace. The Cardinal has arranged for Bosola to come pick up the body, and plans to himself that he's going kill Bosola once he's completed the jobs he's given him. Plans to murder your minions are best kept in your head: Bosola hears him, and knows what's up. Ferdinand the Crazy wanders in and then out, talking to himself. Antonio comes in, saying to himself that he hopes he catches the Cardinal while he's praying, so that maybe he'll be in the mood to forgive him. Bosola, not being able to see that it's Antonio, and, thinking he's some random murder, interprets his words as \"I hope I'll kill that Bosola while he's praying, maybe the Cardinal will pardon me then.\" Quickly, Bosola comes forward and wounds Antonio, only to immediately thereafter discover that it's Antonio, the very guy he was hoping to save. Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered. Why on earth he should tell the dying Antonio that his family is dead when he'd previously lied to the Duchess about the same thing is kind of confusing. Antonio, finally knowing the truth, tells Bosola he just wants to die. He dies, after he voices his final wish that his remaining son be raised away from the courts, and that his body be given to Delio. Basically, nobody can catch a break in this play. Bosola takes his body to where he was supposed to put Julia's body. Quick thing to note: this is the third time the audience has watched Bosola drag a dead body offstage. Just think about that."],"next summary id":"act 3, scene 5","next chapter":"We're with the Duchess and Antonio, right after they've been banished from Ancona.

Bosola cuts to the chase: \\\"I'm here to kill you.\\\" The Cardinal, knowing that killing people is kind of Bosola's specialty, freaks out and starts screaming for help. Finally, something goes Bosola's way: Pescara, Malateste, and the other men are upstairs and can plainly hear the Cardinal having a conniption fit, but remember his previous order not to come even if he's screaming bloody murder, so they stay put. After a bit, though, Pescara figures that something bad is actually going down, and so he ventures out to help the Cardinal. The others follow to watch the Cardinal laugh at Pescara's inability to follow instructions. After killing the Cardinal's servant, Bosola wounds the Cardinal, who doesn't seem to understand why Bosola would want to kill him. Bosola continues to stab the Cardinal when Ferdinand comes in. At this point, things just become kind of farcical--Ferdinand both a) has no idea what's going and b) is still totally cray, and so after babbling a bit he both wounds his own brother further and, totally by accident, deals a mortal wound to Bosola. Bosola kills Ferdinand, as the latter cries out about ambition and his sister and death. Geez, finally. The noblemen upstairs finally get into the room, and are pretty shocked at what they find. Bosola claims that he's completing his revenge for the Duchess, Antonio, Julia, and himself. The Cardinal dies. After painting a bleak picture of the world as a \\\"shadow, or deep pit of darkness\\\" , Bosola dies. Delio comes in with Antonio and the Duchess's son, only to find that he's way too late to the Blood and Guts Party to be of any use. He closes the play by telling the assorted noblemen that they have to try to make the best of the tragedy, and that they've got to establish the eldest son--now the only surviving member of the entire family--as the heir to his mother's position and her integrity.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"Scene V\n\n       [Enter] CARDINAL, with a book\n\n  CARDINAL.

Julia worries about the Cardinal's constancy, but he dismisses her concern as evidence of her own guilt over her infidelity. A servant enters to tell Julia that someone carrying post from Malfi desires to see her. Delio, one of her former suitors, enters, and offers Julia money as a favor. Another servant enters to tell Julia that her husband is in Rome and has delivered a letter to Ferdinand that has left him in a foul mood. After the servant leaves, Delio asks Julia to be his mistress. She says she will ask her husband--he doesn't know if she's joking or not--and leaves. Delio fears Castruccio's delivery of bad news to Ferdinand means that Antonio and the Duchess have been found out","Scene Four is set at the Shrine of Our Lady of Loretto. Here, the Cardinal gives up his cardinal's hat in a ceremony so that he can fight as a soldier. Antonio, the Duchess, and their children arrive, and are banished from Ancona. This all happens in pantomime while the churchmen sing a solemn song. They all exit except for two pilgrims, who discuss what happened and explain that the Pope, spurred by the Cardinal, took the Duchess's dukedom from her","Scene Four returns to the residence of the Cardinal and Ferdinand. The Cardinal, Pescara, Malateste, Roderigo, and Grisolan enter. The Cardinal tells them not to stay with Ferdinand tonight because having people around makes him worse, although in reality he simply wants to ensure that no one is around when he gets rid of Julia's body. He further tells them of a plan to imitate Ferdinand's insanity in an attempt to get his confidence, and so they should ignore any extreme sounds or cries they might hear. They swear they won't go to Ferdinand no matter what they hear from his room. Everyone leaves except the Cardinal. He confesses to himself a plan to kill Bosola as soon as Bosola has killed Antonio and removed Julia's body. The Cardinal exits, and Bosola enters, having overheard the Cardinal's plan to kill him. Ferdinand enters, speaking of strangling, which Bosola assumes is about him. Antonio and a servant follow, and Bosola, frightened and not realizing who it is, stabs Antonio fatally. Before he dies, Bosola tells Antonio what happened to his family. Bosola is devastated by his mistake, and tells the servant to take Antonio's body to Julia's room","We're in Rome. The Cardinal is talking to Castruchio's wife Julia, saying something along the lines of, \"so, what did you tell your husband this time to get yourself out here?\" Wait a second. Ew. Yes, that's right. Julia and the Cardinal. Together. Doing things. Things that are not playing chess or discussing Plato or praying. Yeah. They get into a discussion about infidelity. Topical, no? Julia's already a cheater because she's having an affair with the Cardinal, but the Cardinal says that she'll be unfaithful to him, too. Gee, what a keeper. A servant comes to tell Julia that Delio and Castruchio have both come to Rome, and that Delio's waiting outside to see her. The Cardinal leaves, and Delio comes in. Turns out Delio used to have a thing for Julia, and the first thing he does is offer Julia money. Wait, what? This is weird. Julia doesn't know what's up, until Delio tells her he'd really appreciate it if she'd become his mistress. You know, when she's not with Castruchio. Julia's either got Victoria's Secret levels of hotness or she's just exceedingly politically convenient. It's not quite clear on why Delio is doing this, but our best guess is that he's trying to get in with Julia so he can keep tabs on the Cardinal and help protect Antonio and the Duchess. Julia's admirably quick on the draw: \"Sure, you know what, Delio, I'll get right back to you; lemme go ask my husband what he thinks.\" She leaves Delio alone, who's getting really worried. He hears that the Cardinal is enraged about some letter he's received from Malfi, and fears that somehow Antonio's marriage to the Duchess has been revealed.","We're at Loretto, where Bosola advised the Duchess travel, watching two pilgrims as they watch the Cardinal undergo the ceremony for transforming into a soldier. They continue to watch as the Duchess, Antonio, and their kids are brought forward and banished from Ancona by the Cardinal. The pilgrims muse that Cardinal is being way harsh here. Actually, given that the Duchess is a prince, how can anybody banish her? Well, Ancona's one of the papal states, so the Cardinal, as a representative of the Catholic church, can go to the Pope, claiming, \"oooh, she's all sinful and sex-having, I simply can't abide this ungodliness\" and have her banished. The pilgrims still think it's unjust and nasty, especially that part where the Cardinal ripped off her wedding ring.","The Cardinal is making Malateste and Pescara swear that they won't watch over Ferdinand tonight, or come out of their bedrooms even if they hear a ruckus. He says he wants them to stay put because he doesn't want Ferdinand to be bothered at all, but really he just wants to be sure that he can dispose of Julia's body in peace. The Cardinal has arranged for Bosola to come pick up the body, and plans to himself that he's going kill Bosola once he's completed the jobs he's given him. Plans to murder your minions are best kept in your head: Bosola hears him, and knows what's up. Ferdinand the Crazy wanders in and then out, talking to himself. Antonio comes in, saying to himself that he hopes he catches the Cardinal while he's praying, so that maybe he'll be in the mood to forgive him. Bosola, not being able to see that it's Antonio, and, thinking he's some random murder, interprets his words as \"I hope I'll kill that Bosola while he's praying, maybe the Cardinal will pardon me then.\" Quickly, Bosola comes forward and wounds Antonio, only to immediately thereafter discover that it's Antonio, the very guy he was hoping to save. Bosola, horrified at what he's done, takes this time to tell Antonio that the Duchess and his two other children have been murdered. Why on earth he should tell the dying Antonio that his family is dead when he'd previously lied to the Duchess about the same thing is kind of confusing. Antonio, finally knowing the truth, tells Bosola he just wants to die. He dies, after he voices his final wish that his remaining son be raised away from the courts, and that his body be given to Delio. Basically, nobody can catch a break in this play. Bosola takes his body to where he was supposed to put Julia's body. Quick thing to note: this is the third time the audience has watched Bosola drag a dead body offstage. Just think about that."],"next summary id":"act 5, scene 5","next chapter":"The Cardinal is walking about, contemplating hell and guilt and other stuff you think about when you're super evil, when in comes Bosola with Antonio's body.

Vincentio knocks on Lucentio's door, which the Pedant answers. When Vincentio claims to be Lucentio's father, the Pedant denies this and insists that he himself is Lucentio's father. A heated argument ensues and escalates as Vincentio sees Lucentio's servants, Biondello and Tranio, complicit in the deception. Vincentio beats Biondello and accuses Tranio of murdering and impersonating Lucentio. Petruchio and Kate, meanwhile, step aside and enjoy the unfolding farce. Tranio and Baptista call for an officer, claiming that Vincentio is mad, and the controversy rages until Lucentio and Bianca return from their hasty wedding. Seeing that their game is finally up, Tranio, the Pedant, and Biondello all scatter away. Lucentio pleads for his father's forgiveness, explaining the situation to him and assuring him of Tranio's innocence in the matter. Though still fuming, Vincentio grants his approval of Lucentio and Bianca's union and assures Baptista: \\\"Fear not, we will content you.\\\" The scene ends with Kate bantering with Petruchio and granting him a reluctant kiss. In the play's final scene, the assembled company enjoys a banquet in Lucentio's home. There are three newlywed couples - Kate and Petruchio, Lucentio and Bianca and Hortensio and the Widow. The women leave and Baptista remarks that Petruchio has married \\\"the veriest shrew of all.\\\" Petruchio heartily disagrees, and proposes a wager - the men agree on a hundred crowns - to determine \\\"whose wife is most obedient.\\\" Both Hortensio and Lucentio bid their wives to come as part of the bargain, and both wives refuse. The one wife who does follow the order is, to all but Petruchio's surprise, Katharina. Petruchio, to prove the point even further, asks Katharina to bring forth the other two wives, which she promptly does. Petruchio then requests that she \\\"tell these headstrong women\/What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\\\" Katharina does as asked, delivering a long speech on a wife's duty to her husband.\", \"analysis\": \"The crux of most negative criticism of The Taming of the Shrew is Katharina's final monologue. Indeed, it is hard to accept such lines as these: \\\"Such duty as the subject owes the prince,\/Even such a woman oweth to her husband;\/And when she is forward, peevish, sullen, sour,\/And not obedient to his honest will,\/What is she but a foul contending rebel\/And graceless traitor to her loving lord?\\\"  How are modern audiences to take such a blatant affirmation of sexism, of female subjugation before the male \\\"lord\\\"? But perhaps we need not take the speech at face value at all. A strong current of irony runs through it. To consider first its role in the dramatic symmetry of the play as a whole, Kate's speech can be read as an answer, from the woman's part, to Lucentio's own opening monologue. These lengthy chunks of speech serve as bookends to the drama. Both follow the mold of classical convention laid out in ancient Greek theater: the expositive salvo at the beginning and the moralistic coda at the end, in which the lessons learned are summarized and the meaning of the play is made clear. Needless to say, these conventions had been tampered with well before Shakespeare's time. Even the Greeks themselves didn't always rigidly follow them. Nonetheless, Shakespeare went farther than any dramatist before his time in approaching comedy with tongue firmly in cheek. Katharina's closing monologue may be an elaborate joke. Just as Lucentio's lofty language at the play's beginning was coupled with an erotic undertone, so too the pomposity of Katharina's language contrasts with her subject matter. She repeatedly alludes to royalty and to the machinations of government: \\\"thy lord, thy king, thy governor\\\" ; \\\"thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,\/Thy head, thy sovereign\\\" ; \\\"tribute\\\" ; \\\"prince\\\" ; \\\"loving lord\\\" ; \\\"rule, supremacy, and sway\\\" ; \\\"duty\\\" . She invokes war and battle - \\\"our lances\\\"  - and the hardships of nature - \\\"To painful labor both by sea and land,\/To watch the night in storms, the day in cold.\\\"  And what is she actually talking about? Marriage. True, marriage may be an important institution, but one would never know it from the way it is treated in Shrew. Courtship and marriage is the butt of jokes, games, disguises, innuendoes. In short, marriage is theater in The Taming of the Shrew. Just so, Katharina's speech, in the context of the play that precedes it, is deeply ironic.  It would be one thing if, after subjecting her to such a cruel battery of taming techniques, Petruchio made the speech; but the fact that Katharina is given the last word - and also the longest speech in the play - is itself enough to raise an eyebrow. Perhaps Kate's  speech is her way of putting on yet another act, of wryly offering one more illusion. According to this reading, Kate's subjection is a form of grand sarcasm, as she pretends to genuflect before the childish men who have spent so much of the play in comic confusion. This is how you play their game, she seems to say between the lines, and this is how you beat them at it.\"}","chapter":"ACT V. SCENE I.\nPadua.

Pray, what do you\n\n    think is his name?\n  VINCENTIO. His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought\nhim\n    up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.\n  PEDANT. Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is\nmine\n    only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.\n  VINCENTIO. Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold\non\n    him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son!\nTell\n    me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?\n  TRANIO. Call forth an officer.\n\n                      Enter one with an OFFICER\n\n    Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge\nyou\n    see that he be forthcoming.\n  VINCENTIO. Carry me to the gaol!\n  GREMIO. Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.\n  BAPTISTA. Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to\nprison.\n  GREMIO. Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd\nin\n    this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.\n  PEDANT. Swear if thou dar'st.\n  GREMIO. Nay, I dare not swear it.\n  TRANIO. Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.\n  GREMIO. Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.\n  BAPTISTA. Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!\n  VINCENTIO. Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous\n    villain!\n\n          Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA\n\n  BIONDELLO. O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him,\nforswear\n    him, or else we are all undone.\n         Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and PEDANT, as fast as may be\n  LUCENTIO.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.\n  VINCENTIO. Lives my sweet son?\n  BIANCA. Pardon, dear father.\n  BAPTISTA. How hast thou offended?\n    Where is Lucentio?\n  LUCENTIO. Here's Lucentio,\n    Right son to the right Vincentio,\n    That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,\n    While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.\n  GREMIO. Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!\n  VINCENTIO. Where is that damned villain, Tranio,\n    That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?\n  BAPTISTA. Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?\n  BIANCA. Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.\n  LUCENTIO. Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love\n    Made me exchange my state with Tranio,\n    While he did bear my countenance in the town;\n    And happily I have arrived at the last\n    Unto the wished haven of my bliss.\n    What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;\n    Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.\n  VINCENTIO. I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me\nto\n    the gaol.\n  BAPTISTA.  [To LUCENTIO]  But do you hear, sir? Have you\nmarried my\n    daughter without asking my good will?\n  VINCENTIO. Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but\nI\n    will in to be revenged for this villainy.               Exit\n  BAPTISTA. And I to sound the depth of this knavery.       Exit\n  LUCENTIO. Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.\n                                      Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA\n  GREMIO. My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest;\n    Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.           Exit\n  KATHERINA. Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.\n  PETRUCHIO. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.\n  KATHERINA. What, in the midst of the street?\n  PETRUCHIO. What, art thou asham'd of me?\n  KATHERINA. No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's\naway.\n  KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love,\nstay.\n  PETRUCHIO. Is not this well?

At last, though long, our jarring notes agree;\n    And time it is when raging war is done\n    To smile at scapes and perils overblown.\n    My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,\n    While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.\n    Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,\n    And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,\n    Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.\n    My banquet is to close our stomachs up\n    After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;\n    For now we sit to chat as well as eat.            [They sit]\n  PETRUCHIO. Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!\n  BAPTISTA. Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.\n  PETRUCHIO. Padua affords nothing but what is kind.\n  HORTENSIO. For both our sakes I would that word were true.\n  PETRUCHIO. Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.\n  WIDOW. Then never trust me if I be afeard.\n  PETRUCHIO. YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:\n    I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.\n  WIDOW. He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.\n  PETRUCHIO. Roundly replied.\n  KATHERINA. Mistress, how mean you that?\n  WIDOW. Thus I conceive by him.\n  PETRUCHIO. Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?\n  HORTENSIO. My widow says thus she conceives her tale.\n  PETRUCHIO. Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.\n  KATHERINA. 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'\n    I pray you tell me what you meant by that.\n  WIDOW. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,\n    Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;\n    And now you know my meaning.\n  KATHERINA. A very mean meaning.\n  WIDOW.

Believe me, sir, they butt together well.\n  BIANCA. Head and butt! An hasty-witted body\n    Would say your head and butt were head and horn.\n  VINCENTIO. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?\n  BIANCA. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.\n  PETRUCHIO. Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,\n    Have at you for a bitter jest or two.\n  BIANCA. Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,\n    And then pursue me as you draw your bow.\n    You are welcome all.\n                             Exeunt BIANCA, KATHERINA, and WIDOW\n  PETRUCHIO. She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,\n    This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;\n    Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.\n  TRANIO. O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,\n    Which runs himself, and catches for his master.\n  PETRUCHIO. A good swift simile, but something currish.\n  TRANIO. 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;\n    'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.\n  BAPTISTA. O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.\n  LUCENTIO. I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.\n  HORTENSIO. Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?\n  PETRUCHIO. 'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;\n    And, as the jest did glance away from me,\n    'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.\n  BAPTISTA. Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,\n    I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.\n  PETRUCHIO. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,\n    Let's each one send unto his wife,\n    And he whose wife is most obedient,\n    To come at first when he doth send for her,\n    Shall win the wager which we will propose.\n  HORTENSIO. Content. What's the wager?\n  LUCENTIO. Twenty crowns.\n  PETRUCHIO. Twenty crowns?\n    I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,\n    But twenty times so much upon my wife.\n  LUCENTIO. A hundred then.\n  HORTENSIO. Content.\n  PETRUCHIO. A match! 'tis done.\n  HORTENSIO. Who shall begin?\n  LUCENTIO. That will I.\n    Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.\n  BIONDELLO.

Sir, my mistress sends you word\n    That she is busy and she cannot come.\n  PETRUCHIO. How! She's busy, and she cannot come!\n    Is that an answer?\n  GREMIO. Ay, and a kind one too.\n    Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.\n  PETRUCHIO. I hope better.\n  HORTENSIO. Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife\n    To come to me forthwith.                      Exit BIONDELLO\n  PETRUCHIO. O, ho! entreat her!\n    Nay, then she must needs come.\n  HORTENSIO.

Vincentio knocks on Lucentio's door, which the Pedant answers. When Vincentio claims to be Lucentio's father, the Pedant denies this and insists that he himself is Lucentio's father. A heated argument ensues and escalates as Vincentio sees Lucentio's servants, Biondello and Tranio, complicit in the deception. Vincentio beats Biondello and accuses Tranio of murdering and impersonating Lucentio. Petruchio and Kate, meanwhile, step aside and enjoy the unfolding farce. Tranio and Baptista call for an officer, claiming that Vincentio is mad, and the controversy rages until Lucentio and Bianca return from their hasty wedding. Seeing that their game is finally up, Tranio, the Pedant, and Biondello all scatter away. Lucentio pleads for his father's forgiveness, explaining the situation to him and assuring him of Tranio's innocence in the matter. Though still fuming, Vincentio grants his approval of Lucentio and Bianca's union and assures Baptista: \"Fear not, we will content you.\" The scene ends with Kate bantering with Petruchio and granting him a reluctant kiss. In the play's final scene, the assembled company enjoys a banquet in Lucentio's home. There are three newlywed couples - Kate and Petruchio, Lucentio and Bianca and Hortensio and the Widow. The women leave and Baptista remarks that Petruchio has married \"the veriest shrew of all.\" Petruchio heartily disagrees, and proposes a wager - the men agree on a hundred crowns - to determine \"whose wife is most obedient.\" Both Hortensio and Lucentio bid their wives to come as part of the bargain, and both wives refuse. The one wife who does follow the order is, to all but Petruchio's surprise, Katharina. Petruchio, to prove the point even further, asks Katharina to bring forth the other two wives, which she promptly does. Petruchio then requests that she \"tell these headstrong women\/What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\" Katharina does as asked, delivering a long speech on a wife's duty to her husband.","summary_analysis":"The crux of most negative criticism of The Taming of the Shrew is Katharina's final monologue. Indeed, it is hard to accept such lines as these: \"Such duty as the subject owes the prince,\/Even such a woman oweth to her husband;\/And when she is forward, peevish, sullen, sour,\/And not obedient to his honest will,\/What is she but a foul contending rebel\/And graceless traitor to her loving lord?\"  How are modern audiences to take such a blatant affirmation of sexism, of female subjugation before the male \"lord\"? But perhaps we need not take the speech at face value at all. A strong current of irony runs through it. To consider first its role in the dramatic symmetry of the play as a whole, Kate's speech can be read as an answer, from the woman's part, to Lucentio's own opening monologue. These lengthy chunks of speech serve as bookends to the drama. Both follow the mold of classical convention laid out in ancient Greek theater: the expositive salvo at the beginning and the moralistic coda at the end, in which the lessons learned are summarized and the meaning of the play is made clear. Needless to say, these conventions had been tampered with well before Shakespeare's time. Even the Greeks themselves didn't always rigidly follow them. Nonetheless, Shakespeare went farther than any dramatist before his time in approaching comedy with tongue firmly in cheek. Katharina's closing monologue may be an elaborate joke. Just as Lucentio's lofty language at the play's beginning was coupled with an erotic undertone, so too the pomposity of Katharina's language contrasts with her subject matter. She repeatedly alludes to royalty and to the machinations of government: \"thy lord, thy king, thy governor\" ; \"thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,\/Thy head, thy sovereign\" ; \"tribute\" ; \"prince\" ; \"loving lord\" ; \"rule, supremacy, and sway\" ; \"duty\" . She invokes war and battle - \"our lances\"  - and the hardships of nature - \"To painful labor both by sea and land,\/To watch the night in storms, the day in cold.\"  And what is she actually talking about? Marriage. True, marriage may be an important institution, but one would never know it from the way it is treated in Shrew. Courtship and marriage is the butt of jokes, games, disguises, innuendoes. In short, marriage is theater in The Taming of the Shrew. Just so, Katharina's speech, in the context of the play that precedes it, is deeply ironic.  It would be one thing if, after subjecting her to such a cruel battery of taming techniques, Petruchio made the speech; but the fact that Katharina is given the last word - and also the longest speech in the play - is itself enough to raise an eyebrow. Perhaps Kate's  speech is her way of putting on yet another act, of wryly offering one more illusion. According to this reading, Kate's subjection is a form of grand sarcasm, as she pretends to genuflect before the childish men who have spent so much of the play in comic confusion. This is how you play their game, she seems to say between the lines, and this is how you beat them at it.","summary_length":337.0,"analysis_length":534.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["act iv","act 4, scene 4","scene 4","act iv, scene iv"],"previous chapter":["Inside Petruchio's country abode, Grumio is busy making a fire and complaining about the cold in preparation for his master and mistress' arrival. Curtis, another of Petruchio's servants, has not yet met the new bride and asks if she is as shrewish as reported. Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. Kate begs her husband not to behave so unjustly. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. He reappears and explains his intention to tame the shrew by out-shrewing her: he will mistreat her and deprive her of what she needs, all under the guise of kindness and love. Thus, by insisting that neither her food nor her bed are worthy of her, he will wear out her spirit with lack of nourishment and sleep. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Hortensio states that he has decided to wed a wealthy widow instead of Bianca, leaving \"Cambio\" to woo Bianca alone. Biondello rushes in to aid their attempt, claiming that an old Pedant from Mantua approaches. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Katharina then loses her temper and beats Grumio. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. He demands that Katharina thank him for the meat while telling Hortensio to eat it all himself. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. A Haberdasher and Tailor appear, with a cap and gown respectively. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" He calls for the horses and proclaims he will be at the house by noon. Katharina notes that it is already two o'clock, prompting her husband to berate her for constantly contradicting him. Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt. Tranio offers his own house, noting that the banquet will not be a grand affair but promising a better one later on in Pisa. Lucentio and Bianca, meanwhile, on Biondello's advice, elope to be married post-haste while Baptista is with Tranio and the Pedant. In scene five, Kate and Petruchio are on the road to Padua again. Petruchio continues his shrewish behavior, insisting that the sun is the moon and threatening to turn the cart around if Kate doesn't agree. Kate finally begins to play along, agreeing that the sun is the moon and then changing her opinion when Petruchio changes his. This game is interrupted by the appearance of the real Vincentio, Lucentio's father, whom Petruchio refers to as a \"gentlewoman\" ; he insists that Kate agree, and she does so, calling him a \"budding virgin.\" A bit shaken by their jesting, Vincentio introduces himself, noting that he is on his way to Padua to visit his son. Petruchio informs the man that they are now family - for Lucentio has married the sister of Katharina. Vincentio is shocked and asks Petruchio if he is joking. Petruchio assures him that he is not and invites Vincentio along. The party leaves, after which Hortensio, alone on the stage, confides that he is encouraged and will now go to the widow he intends to wed.","Back in Padua, Tranio and the Pedant wait for Baptista outside his house. The Pedant is introduced to Baptista as Vincentio and the two men seem pleased with one another and the kids' engagement. They all agree to go to Lucentio's place to settle their business and sign some contracts. Baptista sends \"Cambio\" to fetch Bianca and tell her the good news about her upcoming marriage to Lucentio. Instead of fetching Bianca and taking her to her dad, Lucentio catches up with Biondello, who brings him up to speed on the arrangements for his elopement with Bianca. While Baptista is kept busy signing fake contracts with Tranio and the Pedant , Bianca and Lucentio will go to St. Luke's church, where a priest is waiting. Biondello tells Lucentio to get to the church ASAP and to make sure he has some reliable witnesses to confirm the marriage. Lucentio runs off to find Bianca.","Lucentio and Bianca head to the church to be married while her father is busy making arrangements with Tranio and the Pedant. Petruchio, Kate, Vincentio, and Grumio arrive in Padua and stop at Lucentio's house. Vincentio insists his companions join him for a drink, but upon knocking at the door and announcing himself, he is surprised to find another man who claims to be Lucentio's father. When Biondello appears, Vincentio questions him. Biondello pretends not to recognize his master's father. When Tranio comes to investigate the commotion, he too pretends not to know Vincentio. When the Pedant defends Tranio, claiming he's Lucentio, Vincentio moans that Tranio must have murdered the real Lucentio and assumed his persona. Baptista, unwilling to put up with such wild behavior, orders Vincentio to prison. At this point the newlyweds, Lucentio and Bianca, return. Lucentio explains what has happened, why Tranio was masquerading as his master, and announces his marriage to Bianca. Baptista and Vincentio reconcile minimally and enter the house to untangle the situation in which they find themselves. Gremio, realizing he has no hope for a spouse, goes inside to join the wedding feast. Petruchio asks Kate for a kiss, and when she refuses, he threatens to return home again. Good humoredly, she kisses her husband before heading in to the feast.","In Padua, Tranio has properly outfitted the pedant as Vincentio and rehearses his act with him to ensure that their stories match. When Baptista and Lucentio enter, the pedant convinces Baptista that he is indeed Lucentio's father, and that he fully approves of the marriage between Bianca and his son. Baptista, the pedant, and Tranio then leave to find a private place where they can discuss the financial details of the marriage"],"next summary id":"act v","next chapter":"Lucentio, no longer disguised as Cambio, steals away with Bianca to church just before Petruchio, Katharina, Vincentio and Grumio arrive. Vincentio knocks on Lucentio's door, which the Pedant answers. When Vincentio claims to be Lucentio's father, the Pedant denies this and insists that he himself is Lucentio's father. A heated argument ensues and escalates as Vincentio sees Lucentio's servants, Biondello and Tranio, complicit in the deception. Vincentio beats Biondello and accuses Tranio of murdering and impersonating Lucentio. Petruchio and Kate, meanwhile, step aside and enjoy the unfolding farce. Tranio and Baptista call for an officer, claiming that Vincentio is mad, and the controversy rages until Lucentio and Bianca return from their hasty wedding. Seeing that their game is finally up, Tranio, the Pedant, and Biondello all scatter away. Lucentio pleads for his father's forgiveness, explaining the situation to him and assuring him of Tranio's innocence in the matter. Though still fuming, Vincentio grants his approval of Lucentio and Bianca's union and assures Baptista: \"Fear not, we will content you.\" The scene ends with Kate bantering with Petruchio and granting him a reluctant kiss. In the play's final scene, the assembled company enjoys a banquet in Lucentio's home. There are three newlywed couples - Kate and Petruchio, Lucentio and Bianca and Hortensio and the Widow. The women leave and Baptista remarks that Petruchio has married \"the veriest shrew of all.\" Petruchio heartily disagrees, and proposes a wager - the men agree on a hundred crowns - to determine \"whose wife is most obedient.\" Both Hortensio and Lucentio bid their wives to come as part of the bargain, and both wives refuse. The one wife who does follow the order is, to all but Petruchio's surprise, Katharina. Petruchio, to prove the point even further, asks Katharina to bring forth the other two wives, which she promptly does. Petruchio then requests that she \"tell these headstrong women\/What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\" Katharina does as asked, delivering a long speech on a wife's duty to her husband."}

Curtis, another of Petruchio's servants, has not yet met the new bride and asks if she is as shrewish as reported. Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. Kate begs her husband not to behave so unjustly. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. He reappears and explains his intention to tame the shrew by out-shrewing her: he will mistreat her and deprive her of what she needs, all under the guise of kindness and love. Thus, by insisting that neither her food nor her bed are worthy of her, he will wear out her spirit with lack of nourishment and sleep. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Hortensio states that he has decided to wed a wealthy widow instead of Bianca, leaving \"Cambio\" to woo Bianca alone. Biondello rushes in to aid their attempt, claiming that an old Pedant from Mantua approaches. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Katharina then loses her temper and beats Grumio. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. He demands that Katharina thank him for the meat while telling Hortensio to eat it all himself. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. A Haberdasher and Tailor appear, with a cap and gown respectively. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" He calls for the horses and proclaims he will be at the house by noon. Katharina notes that it is already two o'clock, prompting her husband to berate her for constantly contradicting him. Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt. Tranio offers his own house, noting that the banquet will not be a grand affair but promising a better one later on in Pisa. Lucentio and Bianca, meanwhile, on Biondello's advice, elope to be married post-haste while Baptista is with Tranio and the Pedant. In scene five, Kate and Petruchio are on the road to Padua again. Petruchio continues his shrewish behavior, insisting that the sun is the moon and threatening to turn the cart around if Kate doesn't agree. Kate finally begins to play along, agreeing that the sun is the moon and then changing her opinion when Petruchio changes his. This game is interrupted by the appearance of the real Vincentio, Lucentio's father, whom Petruchio refers to as a \"gentlewoman\" ; he insists that Kate agree, and she does so, calling him a \"budding virgin.\" A bit shaken by their jesting, Vincentio introduces himself, noting that he is on his way to Padua to visit his son. Petruchio informs the man that they are now family - for Lucentio has married the sister of Katharina. Vincentio is shocked and asks Petruchio if he is joking. Petruchio assures him that he is not and invites Vincentio along. The party leaves, after which Hortensio, alone on the stage, confides that he is encouraged and will now go to the widow he intends to wed.","Back in Padua, Tranio and the Pedant wait for Baptista outside his house. The Pedant is introduced to Baptista as Vincentio and the two men seem pleased with one another and the kids' engagement. They all agree to go to Lucentio's place to settle their business and sign some contracts. Baptista sends \"Cambio\" to fetch Bianca and tell her the good news about her upcoming marriage to Lucentio. Instead of fetching Bianca and taking her to her dad, Lucentio catches up with Biondello, who brings him up to speed on the arrangements for his elopement with Bianca. While Baptista is kept busy signing fake contracts with Tranio and the Pedant , Bianca and Lucentio will go to St. Luke's church, where a priest is waiting. Biondello tells Lucentio to get to the church ASAP and to make sure he has some reliable witnesses to confirm the marriage. Lucentio runs off to find Bianca.","Lucentio and Bianca head to the church to be married while her father is busy making arrangements with Tranio and the Pedant. Petruchio, Kate, Vincentio, and Grumio arrive in Padua and stop at Lucentio's house. Vincentio insists his companions join him for a drink, but upon knocking at the door and announcing himself, he is surprised to find another man who claims to be Lucentio's father. When Biondello appears, Vincentio questions him. Biondello pretends not to recognize his master's father. When Tranio comes to investigate the commotion, he too pretends not to know Vincentio. When the Pedant defends Tranio, claiming he's Lucentio, Vincentio moans that Tranio must have murdered the real Lucentio and assumed his persona.

Hortensio has arrived with his new wife, the Widow, and the three couples begin to converse. Petruchio notes how Hortensio appears to be afraid of his wife, with the Widow offering a few particularly nasty retorts. Kate and the Widow exchange words, and shortly thereafter the three women exit, leaving the men to their devices. The men decide to wager on who has the most obedient wife. They bet one hundred crowns and one by one send for their wives. Lucentio is immediately refused by Bianca. Hortensio is next to be refused, with his wife adding the command he should come to her. Finally Petruchio takes his turn, and all are surprised when Kate comes to do his bidding. Petruchio sends Kate to fetch the other women and, upon their arrival, tells Kate to destroy the hat she wears and then lecture the women on \\\"What duty they do owe their lords and husbands\\\" . After Kate delivers an elaborate speech about a woman's duty to her husband, the party-goers are left dumbfounded, and Petruchio and Kate leave the party, headed to bed.\", \"analysis\": \"Some critics regard this scene as one of the more enigmatic in Shakespearean comedy, but such a claim is really unwarranted. Oftentimes people are surprised at Kate's speech , but upon closer inspection it appears clear that her speech is in no way a concession; rather, it carries a much stronger message and brings the play to a clever resolution. Shakespeare gives us ample suggestions that audiences should not take Kate's soliloquy at face value but instead should look beyond the literal to the deeper meaning this passage contains. One of the first clues that Shakespeare intends Kate's speech not be taken literally is that the soliloquy comes in the context of an entertainment. Although Kate appears to speak earnestly, we must remember that she is playing a role in a game. The notion of husbands betting on their wives, in fact, is laughable and adds an air of merriment to the feast. After the women leave, the men are left to their devices. Petruchio clearly stands above all the other men in that he is gracious and dignified, offering a toast not only to the health of the newlyweds, but also \\\"all that shot and missed\\\" . The general consensus among the men, however, is that Petruchio has fared the worst of all, ending up with the woman Baptista himself calls \\\"the veriest shrew of all\\\" . Knowing the joke will be on the men, Petruchio calls for a wager. He even demands the ante be increased to an amount worthy of his wife. His willingness to wager on Kate is not mercenary or dehumanizing, as some critics might think, but rather, is a testament to his faith in her. He is, in essence, trusting her with his reputation. He's not the sort of man who would enter a contest so boldly if he weren't sure of winning. He is confident in his ability to understand Katherine, and she does not let him down. Lucentio begins the contest by summoning Bianca. Although just hours earlier she was demure and willing to do his bidding, Bianca is now headstrong. Her denial of Lucentio, in fact, serves as a hint of what's to come. Bianca, who's name means \\\"white\\\" and is associated with purity, is not at all pure of spirit. In fact, she has been disguised all along and after catching her husband, she is quick to abandon her false front. Hortensio takes up the challenge next, and after Bianca's refusal to appear, we are not at all surprised to find the Widow will not come when beckoned. In fact, the Widow insists \\\"She will not come. She bids you come to her\\\" . The Widow is no fool and is unwilling to give up even an ounce of her power. Why did she marry Hortensio, then? Most likely because of economic reasons. The tide is turned on Hortensio who thought he was gaining economic independence  by marrying the Widow. All eyes are on Petruchio when he calls his wife. He commands her presence  and Hortensio's entreating ), and much to everyone's surprise she appears. At this point, the crowd is flabbergasted, and their surprise provides Kate and Petruchio just the opportunity to get the best of all of them. Kate is aware Petruchio is not only staking his reputation on her, but he is giving her the opportunity to have power over all others present. By asking Kate to go get the other women, Petruchio gives her an opportunity to lord over the others. Later, in getting her to stomp on her hat, the couple works together to give the illusion of Petruchio having control, while in reality, they share power together and reap the mutual rewards . Kate's soliloquy on wifely obedience is, perhaps, the most important of the play. Throughout the play, Shakespeare has been careful to poke fun at the institution of marriage and here is no exception. Also, we know from the other comedies that Shakespeare is particularly empathetic to female characters. A truly anti-feminist reading would be unlikely, given what we know of other Shakespearean heroines. Further, this is the longest speech of the play -- Shakespeare wouldn't give Kate the final word unless we were to feel affection for her -- something that is not possible if you read her as being defeated and broken. Finally, facility with language is considered a masculine trait, and for Kate to exhibit such linguistic aptitude suggests that she has not totally abandoned her masculine ways. Exploring the language of Katherine's soliloquy shows, too, that she is having fun. Many of her expressions are hyperbolic, not unlike much of the rhetoric Petruchio used earlier on her. She repeats the sentiment of the time -- a sentiment she knows will please the ears of her listeners . She does make an interesting distinction, though, between obeying one's husband blindly and obeying with discretion. She claims that one should be \\\"obedient to his honest will\\\" , which has the implication that, when the husband's will is not honest, his will is not to be obeyed, an important distinction when considering whether Kate has been truly \\\"tamed.\\\" After Kate finishes her speech, Petruchio asks again for a kiss, and this time Kate gladly complies. Petruchio then suggests they head off to bed, with the obvious implication of consummating their marriage, thereby making it official. Kate is glad to agree, and so the two exit together. All the others are left to ponder what they have just seen, while we can likely reason that Kate and Petruchio will live happily ever after, working together to dupe and gull the world around them, two players in a game only they understand.

Hortensio has arrived with his new wife, the Widow, and the three couples begin to converse. Petruchio notes how Hortensio appears to be afraid of his wife, with the Widow offering a few particularly nasty retorts. Kate and the Widow exchange words, and shortly thereafter the three women exit, leaving the men to their devices. The men decide to wager on who has the most obedient wife. They bet one hundred crowns and one by one send for their wives. Lucentio is immediately refused by Bianca. Hortensio is next to be refused, with his wife adding the command he should come to her. Finally Petruchio takes his turn, and all are surprised when Kate comes to do his bidding. Petruchio sends Kate to fetch the other women and, upon their arrival, tells Kate to destroy the hat she wears and then lecture the women on \"What duty they do owe their lords and husbands\" . After Kate delivers an elaborate speech about a woman's duty to her husband, the party-goers are left dumbfounded, and Petruchio and Kate leave the party, headed to bed.","summary_analysis":"Some critics regard this scene as one of the more enigmatic in Shakespearean comedy, but such a claim is really unwarranted. Oftentimes people are surprised at Kate's speech , but upon closer inspection it appears clear that her speech is in no way a concession; rather, it carries a much stronger message and brings the play to a clever resolution. Shakespeare gives us ample suggestions that audiences should not take Kate's soliloquy at face value but instead should look beyond the literal to the deeper meaning this passage contains. One of the first clues that Shakespeare intends Kate's speech not be taken literally is that the soliloquy comes in the context of an entertainment. Although Kate appears to speak earnestly, we must remember that she is playing a role in a game. The notion of husbands betting on their wives, in fact, is laughable and adds an air of merriment to the feast. After the women leave, the men are left to their devices. Petruchio clearly stands above all the other men in that he is gracious and dignified, offering a toast not only to the health of the newlyweds, but also \"all that shot and missed\" . The general consensus among the men, however, is that Petruchio has fared the worst of all, ending up with the woman Baptista himself calls \"the veriest shrew of all\" . Knowing the joke will be on the men, Petruchio calls for a wager. He even demands the ante be increased to an amount worthy of his wife. His willingness to wager on Kate is not mercenary or dehumanizing, as some critics might think, but rather, is a testament to his faith in her. He is, in essence, trusting her with his reputation. He's not the sort of man who would enter a contest so boldly if he weren't sure of winning. He is confident in his ability to understand Katherine, and she does not let him down. Lucentio begins the contest by summoning Bianca. Although just hours earlier she was demure and willing to do his bidding, Bianca is now headstrong. Her denial of Lucentio, in fact, serves as a hint of what's to come. Bianca, who's name means \"white\" and is associated with purity, is not at all pure of spirit. In fact, she has been disguised all along and after catching her husband, she is quick to abandon her false front. Hortensio takes up the challenge next, and after Bianca's refusal to appear, we are not at all surprised to find the Widow will not come when beckoned. In fact, the Widow insists \"She will not come. She bids you come to her\" . The Widow is no fool and is unwilling to give up even an ounce of her power. Why did she marry Hortensio, then? Most likely because of economic reasons. The tide is turned on Hortensio who thought he was gaining economic independence  by marrying the Widow. All eyes are on Petruchio when he calls his wife. He commands her presence  and Hortensio's entreating ), and much to everyone's surprise she appears. At this point, the crowd is flabbergasted, and their surprise provides Kate and Petruchio just the opportunity to get the best of all of them. Kate is aware Petruchio is not only staking his reputation on her, but he is giving her the opportunity to have power over all others present. By asking Kate to go get the other women, Petruchio gives her an opportunity to lord over the others. Later, in getting her to stomp on her hat, the couple works together to give the illusion of Petruchio having control, while in reality, they share power together and reap the mutual rewards . Kate's soliloquy on wifely obedience is, perhaps, the most important of the play. Throughout the play, Shakespeare has been careful to poke fun at the institution of marriage and here is no exception. Also, we know from the other comedies that Shakespeare is particularly empathetic to female characters. A truly anti-feminist reading would be unlikely, given what we know of other Shakespearean heroines. Further, this is the longest speech of the play -- Shakespeare wouldn't give Kate the final word unless we were to feel affection for her -- something that is not possible if you read her as being defeated and broken. Finally, facility with language is considered a masculine trait, and for Kate to exhibit such linguistic aptitude suggests that she has not totally abandoned her masculine ways. Exploring the language of Katherine's soliloquy shows, too, that she is having fun. Many of her expressions are hyperbolic, not unlike much of the rhetoric Petruchio used earlier on her. She repeats the sentiment of the time -- a sentiment she knows will please the ears of her listeners . She does make an interesting distinction, though, between obeying one's husband blindly and obeying with discretion. She claims that one should be \"obedient to his honest will\" , which has the implication that, when the husband's will is not honest, his will is not to be obeyed, an important distinction when considering whether Kate has been truly \"tamed.\" After Kate finishes her speech, Petruchio asks again for a kiss, and this time Kate gladly complies. Petruchio then suggests they head off to bed, with the obvious implication of consummating their marriage, thereby making it official. Kate is glad to agree, and so the two exit together. All the others are left to ponder what they have just seen, while we can likely reason that Kate and Petruchio will live happily ever after, working together to dupe and gull the world around them, two players in a game only they understand.

Curtis, another of Petruchio's servants, has not yet met the new bride and asks if she is as shrewish as reported. Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. Kate begs her husband not to behave so unjustly. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. He reappears and explains his intention to tame the shrew by out-shrewing her: he will mistreat her and deprive her of what she needs, all under the guise of kindness and love. Thus, by insisting that neither her food nor her bed are worthy of her, he will wear out her spirit with lack of nourishment and sleep. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Hortensio states that he has decided to wed a wealthy widow instead of Bianca, leaving \"Cambio\" to woo Bianca alone. Biondello rushes in to aid their attempt, claiming that an old Pedant from Mantua approaches. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Katharina then loses her temper and beats Grumio. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. He demands that Katharina thank him for the meat while telling Hortensio to eat it all himself. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. A Haberdasher and Tailor appear, with a cap and gown respectively. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" He calls for the horses and proclaims he will be at the house by noon. Katharina notes that it is already two o'clock, prompting her husband to berate her for constantly contradicting him. Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt. Tranio offers his own house, noting that the banquet will not be a grand affair but promising a better one later on in Pisa. Lucentio and Bianca, meanwhile, on Biondello's advice, elope to be married post-haste while Baptista is with Tranio and the Pedant. In scene five, Kate and Petruchio are on the road to Padua again. Petruchio continues his shrewish behavior, insisting that the sun is the moon and threatening to turn the cart around if Kate doesn't agree. Kate finally begins to play along, agreeing that the sun is the moon and then changing her opinion when Petruchio changes his. This game is interrupted by the appearance of the real Vincentio, Lucentio's father, whom Petruchio refers to as a \"gentlewoman\" ; he insists that Kate agree, and she does so, calling him a \"budding virgin.\" A bit shaken by their jesting, Vincentio introduces himself, noting that he is on his way to Padua to visit his son. Petruchio informs the man that they are now family - for Lucentio has married the sister of Katharina. Vincentio is shocked and asks Petruchio if he is joking. Petruchio assures him that he is not and invites Vincentio along. The party leaves, after which Hortensio, alone on the stage, confides that he is encouraged and will now go to the widow he intends to wed.","Back in Padua, Tranio and the Pedant wait for Baptista outside his house. The Pedant is introduced to Baptista as Vincentio and the two men seem pleased with one another and the kids' engagement. They all agree to go to Lucentio's place to settle their business and sign some contracts. Baptista sends \"Cambio\" to fetch Bianca and tell her the good news about her upcoming marriage to Lucentio. Instead of fetching Bianca and taking her to her dad, Lucentio catches up with Biondello, who brings him up to speed on the arrangements for his elopement with Bianca. While Baptista is kept busy signing fake contracts with Tranio and the Pedant , Bianca and Lucentio will go to St. Luke's church, where a priest is waiting. Biondello tells Lucentio to get to the church ASAP and to make sure he has some reliable witnesses to confirm the marriage. Lucentio runs off to find Bianca.","Lucentio and Bianca head to the church to be married while her father is busy making arrangements with Tranio and the Pedant. Petruchio, Kate, Vincentio, and Grumio arrive in Padua and stop at Lucentio's house. Vincentio insists his companions join him for a drink, but upon knocking at the door and announcing himself, he is surprised to find another man who claims to be Lucentio's father. When Biondello appears, Vincentio questions him. Biondello pretends not to recognize his master's father. When Tranio comes to investigate the commotion, he too pretends not to know Vincentio. When the Pedant defends Tranio, claiming he's Lucentio, Vincentio moans that Tranio must have murdered the real Lucentio and assumed his persona. Baptista, unwilling to put up with such wild behavior, orders Vincentio to prison. At this point the newlyweds, Lucentio and Bianca, return. Lucentio explains what has happened, why Tranio was masquerading as his master, and announces his marriage to Bianca. Baptista and Vincentio reconcile minimally and enter the house to untangle the situation in which they find themselves. Gremio, realizing he has no hope for a spouse, goes inside to join the wedding feast. Petruchio asks Kate for a kiss, and when she refuses, he threatens to return home again. Good humoredly, she kisses her husband before heading in to the feast.","In Padua, Tranio has properly outfitted the pedant as Vincentio and rehearses his act with him to ensure that their stories match. When Baptista and Lucentio enter, the pedant convinces Baptista that he is indeed Lucentio's father, and that he fully approves of the marriage between Bianca and his son. Baptista, the pedant, and Tranio then leave to find a private place where they can discuss the financial details of the marriage"],"next summary id":"scene 5","next chapter":"In this final scene, all the characters come together to celebrate Bianca and Lucentio's wedding.

She complains to Grumio that what particularly infuriates her is that Petruchio torments under the pretense of love. This pretense--not to mention Petruchio's erratic and peremptory behavior--makes it hard for her to react to his actions with her typical anger, since he seems to have the best intentions and to only desire her happiness and comfort. And yet, given Kate's obvious intelligence, it is remarkable that she does not see through Petruchio's facade and realize that he is doing everything simply to frustrate her. Most likely, she does in fact suspect foul play, as she indicates when she says that he torments her \\\"under name of perfect love,\\\" implying that the \\\"name\\\" and the reality do not necessarily match . She simply does not wish to stand up to him on this point. The play is, after all, a comedy, and we are probably meant to believe that, despite their difficulties, Kate and Petruchio are falling in love, if they have not already done so. Under the comic influence of love, Kate is much less likely to use the full power of her critical thought to see through Petruchio's schemes. Of course, the attraction between Kate and Petruchio, which exists despite their social inequality and seems to stem from their intellectual equality, is central to our ability to read The Taming of the Shrew as something more than merely a troubling chronicle of sixteenth-century spousal abuse. Most readers, as Jean E. Howard notes in her introduction to the play in The Norton Shakespeare, \\\"have seen in Kate and Petruchio's relationship an attractive mutuality and vitality they find difficult to reconcile with the idea that the play is simply a lesson in how to subordinate a woman.\\\" This sense of an \\\"attractive mutuality\\\" is what enables the play to be funny, but one of the unresolvable complications of The Taming of the Shrew is the question of how we should reconcile the apparent love story of the two main characters with Petruchio's obviously cruel treatment of his new wife.  In Act IV, scene iii, Kate once again tries to draw the line: when Petruchio tries to throw away the cap that the tailor made, which she very much likes. She has had enough and tries to establish an autonomous position: . . . I trust I may have leave to speak,And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.. . .. . . I will be freeEven to the uttermost as I please in words.            Unfortunately, not even this is enough to get her so much as the cap in the end. She may be free in words, but her words now fall upon deaf ears, which is the source of her frustration. Before she met Petruchio, even though her words were rarely taken well, at least she could be assured of a reaction to them, and she seemed to take some delight in the reaction she could wring from men. Now, her words are ignored even when she removes their edge and asks for the simplest courtesies. Now indeed she cannot choose, for though she is powerless with Petruchio, she would only endure greater shame if she fled him and returned to Padua.  Also in Act IV, scene iii, Shakespeare expands his social commentary to include a critique of the importance attributed to clothing. Petruchio says that it is \\\"the mind that makes that body rich, \/ And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, \/ So honour peereth in the meanest habit\\\" . By \\\"meanest habit,\\\" Petruchio means poor attire. This speech echoes the sentiment that Petruchio expressed earlier to Baptista before the wedding, and the repetition should be noted. The Induction seemed to claim that clothes and accoutrements could in fact change the man: Sly changed from a drunkard to a nobleman. Yet, here, Shakespeare suggests the contrary: the inner nature of a person will eventually shine through, regardless of the apparel that person chooses to wear. Indeed, the ruse of Sly's nobility will last only a short time; sooner or later, he will be put back on the street. It is not clear whether Kate shares a similar fate, however. Just as the lord dresses Sly, so does society force Kate to wear the clothing of marriage, both literally and figuratively. Unlike Sly, Kate is unhappy in the role of the wife, a role that stifles her independent spirit. In this scene, however, as Kate's motivations and actions continue to show that she is changing, Shakespeare forces us to question whether the clothing actually does influence the person within.\"}","chapter":"SCENE V.\nA public road\n\nEnter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and SERVANTS\n\n  PETRUCHIO.

The Induction seemed to claim that clothes and accoutrements could in fact change the man: Sly changed from a drunkard to a nobleman. Yet, here, Shakespeare suggests the contrary: the inner nature of a person will eventually shine through, regardless of the apparel that person chooses to wear. Indeed, the ruse of Sly's nobility will last only a short time; sooner or later, he will be put back on the street. It is not clear whether Kate shares a similar fate, however. Just as the lord dresses Sly, so does society force Kate to wear the clothing of marriage, both literally and figuratively. Unlike Sly, Kate is unhappy in the role of the wife, a role that stifles her independent spirit. In this scene, however, as Kate's motivations and actions continue to show that she is changing, Shakespeare forces us to question whether the clothing actually does influence the person within.","summary_length":57.0,"analysis_length":806.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["act iv","act 4, scene 4","scene 4","act iv, scene iv"],"previous chapter":["Inside Petruchio's country abode, Grumio is busy making a fire and complaining about the cold in preparation for his master and mistress' arrival. Curtis, another of Petruchio's servants, has not yet met the new bride and asks if she is as shrewish as reported. Grumio assures him that Petruchio is the greater shrew of the two. When Petruchio arrives he behaves tyranically, beating his servants for trivial faults. Kate begs her husband not to behave so unjustly. When they sit down to dinner Petruchio claims that the meat is overcooked and storms off to bed with Kate. He reappears and explains his intention to tame the shrew by out-shrewing her: he will mistreat her and deprive her of what she needs, all under the guise of kindness and love. Thus, by insisting that neither her food nor her bed are worthy of her, he will wear out her spirit with lack of nourishment and sleep. Meanwhile, in Padua, Hortensio is disgusted by the flirtation of Bianca and \"Cambio,\" and shares his disgust with Tranio, who he takes to be noble. At Tranio's suggestion, the two vow to cease pursuing Bianca if she would flirt with a lowly schoolteacher. Hortensio states that he has decided to wed a wealthy widow instead of Bianca, leaving \"Cambio\" to woo Bianca alone. Biondello rushes in to aid their attempt, claiming that an old Pedant from Mantua approaches. Tranio tricks the Pedant into assuming the guise of Vincentio of Pisa after concocting a story that any Mantuan is to be summarily executed in Padua. The Pedant agrees to the disguise and Tranio fills him in on his courtship of Bianca. Scene three of the Act finds us back at Petruchio's house, where Kate complains that she is famished. Grumio, like Petruchio, refuses to bring her any food, protesting that none of it is good enough for her. Katharina then loses her temper and beats Grumio. Petruchio enters with a plate of meat and Hortensio by his side. He demands that Katharina thank him for the meat while telling Hortensio to eat it all himself. Petruchio next tells Katharina that the two of them will shortly return to her father's house, dressed in the best finery. A Haberdasher and Tailor appear, with a cap and gown respectively. Petruchio violently dismisses both items over the protestations of Kate, who likes them. She seems polite and kind compared to Petruchio. Her husband, however, refuses to allow her to dress up, declaring that clothes are of little importance and that he and Kate will arrive at Baptista's \"in these honest, mean habiliments.\" He calls for the horses and proclaims he will be at the house by noon. Katharina notes that it is already two o'clock, prompting her husband to berate her for constantly contradicting him. Scene four takes us to Padua again, where Tranio and the Pedant , meet with Baptista. \"Vincentio\" grants his permission for his son and Bianca to be wed and guarantees Bianca a large dower. These claims prove satisfactory for Baptista, who readily agrees to the marriage, but decides against conducting the formal contract and agreement inside his own house, for fear that Gremio and his servants may be listening and might interrupt. Tranio offers his own house, noting that the banquet will not be a grand affair but promising a better one later on in Pisa. Lucentio and Bianca, meanwhile, on Biondello's advice, elope to be married post-haste while Baptista is with Tranio and the Pedant. In scene five, Kate and Petruchio are on the road to Padua again. Petruchio continues his shrewish behavior, insisting that the sun is the moon and threatening to turn the cart around if Kate doesn't agree. Kate finally begins to play along, agreeing that the sun is the moon and then changing her opinion when Petruchio changes his. This game is interrupted by the appearance of the real Vincentio, Lucentio's father, whom Petruchio refers to as a \"gentlewoman\" ; he insists that Kate agree, and she does so, calling him a \"budding virgin.\" A bit shaken by their jesting, Vincentio introduces himself, noting that he is on his way to Padua to visit his son. Petruchio informs the man that they are now family - for Lucentio has married the sister of Katharina. Vincentio is shocked and asks Petruchio if he is joking. Petruchio assures him that he is not and invites Vincentio along. The party leaves, after which Hortensio, alone on the stage, confides that he is encouraged and will now go to the widow he intends to wed.","Back in Padua, Tranio and the Pedant wait for Baptista outside his house. The Pedant is introduced to Baptista as Vincentio and the two men seem pleased with one another and the kids' engagement. They all agree to go to Lucentio's place to settle their business and sign some contracts. Baptista sends \"Cambio\" to fetch Bianca and tell her the good news about her upcoming marriage to Lucentio. Instead of fetching Bianca and taking her to her dad, Lucentio catches up with Biondello, who brings him up to speed on the arrangements for his elopement with Bianca. While Baptista is kept busy signing fake contracts with Tranio and the Pedant , Bianca and Lucentio will go to St. Luke's church, where a priest is waiting. Biondello tells Lucentio to get to the church ASAP and to make sure he has some reliable witnesses to confirm the marriage. Lucentio runs off to find Bianca.","Lucentio and Bianca head to the church to be married while her father is busy making arrangements with Tranio and the Pedant. Petruchio, Kate, Vincentio, and Grumio arrive in Padua and stop at Lucentio's house. Vincentio insists his companions join him for a drink, but upon knocking at the door and announcing himself, he is surprised to find another man who claims to be Lucentio's father. When Biondello appears, Vincentio questions him. Biondello pretends not to recognize his master's father. When Tranio comes to investigate the commotion, he too pretends not to know Vincentio. When the Pedant defends Tranio, claiming he's Lucentio, Vincentio moans that Tranio must have murdered the real Lucentio and assumed his persona. Baptista, unwilling to put up with such wild behavior, orders Vincentio to prison. At this point the newlyweds, Lucentio and Bianca, return. Lucentio explains what has happened, why Tranio was masquerading as his master, and announces his marriage to Bianca. Baptista and Vincentio reconcile minimally and enter the house to untangle the situation in which they find themselves. Gremio, realizing he has no hope for a spouse, goes inside to join the wedding feast. Petruchio asks Kate for a kiss, and when she refuses, he threatens to return home again. Good humoredly, she kisses her husband before heading in to the feast.","In Padua, Tranio has properly outfitted the pedant as Vincentio and rehearses his act with him to ensure that their stories match. When Baptista and Lucentio enter, the pedant convinces Baptista that he is indeed Lucentio's father, and that he fully approves of the marriage between Bianca and his son. Baptista, the pedant, and Tranio then leave to find a private place where they can discuss the financial details of the marriage"],"next summary id":"act iv, scene v","next chapter":"Lucentio returns to the stage with Biondello, who informs him that Baptista has requested that Cambio bring Bianca to dinner.

She resolves to prepare his body for burial, and then kill herself.\", \"analysis\": \"Antony has lost much of himself for the sake of his love of Cleopatra. Actium was partly Cleopatra's fault, but the final responsibility lies with him. When he believes that Cleopatra has betrayed him, he loses all sense of his identity. His honor, manhood, and sense of self as a Roman are destroyed when he casts aside valor and duty and Actium. In the East, his persona has been linked to Cleopatra and his love for her. He played the soldier-lover and magnanimous ruler who laid whole kingdoms at her feet. When he believes she has betrayed him, his sense of himself disappears. He speaks of clouds that seem to make pictures, but just as quickly dissolve into vapors: \\\"My good knave Eros, now thy captain is \/ Even such a body: here I am Antony, \/ Yet cannot hold this visible shape. Empire and honor were lost first. Then Antony believes his lover has been lost, and feels as if his whole identity is evaporating. We have seen Antony as a general, a lover, a magnanimous friend and leader. This speech touches on what makes Antony great. He has something of the poet in him, sensitive to beauty and life's sensuous pleasures. The clouds become a metaphor for a universal condition, the ephemeral nature of power and life, both of which end all too quickly. Antony is as quick to forgive as ever when he hears news of Cleopatra's death. He resolves to die, to be with her, even though he has reason to believe she betrayed him. His love for her is his ultimate priority. Most Romans cannot respect that. When the first set of guards arrives with Decretas, Antony cries out, \\\"Let him that loves me strike me dead\\\". The First, Second, and Third Guards' replies are unequivocal: \\\"Not I,\\\" \\\"Nor Me,\\\" and \\\"Nor anyone. The use of the word \\\"love\\\" is significant. Antony has traded away love of his countrymen and fellow soldiers for love of Cleopatra. In Antony's last moments, he concerns himself with giving Cleopatra advice, having forgiven her immediately for the deception about her own death. Antony's last words, however, are not about love. They concern his honor, and how he has met his end nobly by his own hand, \\\"a Roman by a Roman \/ Valiantly vanquished\\\". Since Actium, Antony has been struggling to retain some sense of himself. Suicide is the only way that he has lived up to the Roman conception of honor, and it is this thought that comforts him in the end. Antony has lived torn between two conceptions of what life should be. The pomp and decadence of his life in Egypt seduced him, and his love for Cleopatra ultimately destroyed him. But he is not a failure in every sense. His love for Cleopatra will become legend, and he is untarnished to Cleopatra herself, who calls him \\\"noblest of men\\\" , proclaiming that the gods have taken him because \\\"this world did equal theirs \/ Till they had stol'n our jewel\\\". She does not understand him completely. Cleopatra could never understand all the nuances of what it means to be Roman, any more than Octavius could understand what it means to be an Egyptian queen. But she adores Antony without qualification. To emphasize Cleopatra as wily lover and decadent Queen, Shakespeare never brings her children on stage.

Dying, Antony commands his guards to bear his body to Cleopatra\", \"analysis\": \"Act IV, scenes ix-xv In Act IV, scene xv, Antony, who has been betrayed by his lover and has lost the war to Caesar, offers one of the play's most profound reflections on the connection between character and circumstance: \\\"Here I am Antony, \/ Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave\\\" . As his fortune changes from good to bad, so, he believes, his character slips from honorable to dishonorable. He likens himself to a cloud that shifts from one shape into another. Given the play's investment in spectacle--neither love nor war truly matters unless one has something to show for them--Antony's disturbance at being unable to hold a \\\"visible shape\\\" is particularly interesting. His honor, it seems, is primarily a function of whether the world sees him as honorable. When it fails to do so, Antony no longer fits into it. His rigid definition of himself as a victorious general and as Cleopatra's lover betrays his Roman sensibilities, which cannot and will not allow him to assume the contradictory roles of the conqueror and the conquered. He will, he decides, either be the hero or cease to exist at all by killing himself. His statement \\\"Here I am Antony\\\" reflects his search for a glimpse of his former, simpler self: the indomitable hero who will put an end to his life. Thus, he thankfully notes to Eros, all that remains to him is suicide. Once the second sea battle is lost, the play belongs to Antony until his death--Cleopatra recedes, as does Caesar. In the scenes leading up to his death, Antony's feelings of betrayal, regret, and, ultimately, love give way to some of the finest language in the play. Oh, sun, thy uprise shall I see no more: Fortune and Antony part here; even here Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts That spanieled me at heels, to whom I gaveTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweetsOn blossoming Caesar, and this pine is barkedThat over topped them all.           Here, as Antony bids goodbye to \\\"Fortune,\\\" he comes to an important realization from which he cannot recover. Comparing himself to a tree that once towered above all others, he now feels that Cleopatra's inconstant love, which once \\\"spanieled\\\" at his heels, has stripped him of his bark. This metaphor expresses that he feels raw, unprotected, and doomed to die. Cleopatra enters soon after Antony delivers these lines, and he scares her away with vicious threats. More than anger, however, Antony feels a keen sense of loss. He laments, \\\"I made these wars for . . .  the Queen-- \/ Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine, \/ Which . . .  had annexed unto't \/ A million more, now lost\\\" . This utterance of regret confirms Antony's lost sense of self: he no longer possesses either of the identities--military giant or lover of Cleopatra--that have defined him so well. The news of Cleopatra's suicide suffices to cool Antony's temper and returns him to thoughts of reconciliation. By killing himself, Antony envisions joining his love in the afterlife: \\\"I come, my queen . . .  \/ Where souls do couch on flowers we'll hand in hand, \/ And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze\\\" . This consummation in death of their love moves the couple toward its ultimate victory over Caesar and the Roman Empire.\"}","chapter":"Alexandria.

Cleopatra's palace. Antony gives a marvelous speech to Eros about clouds, likening himself to the cloud that has a shape for brief moments before it dissolves. He tells Eros that he should not weep, because they have their own suicides to attend to. Mardian the eunuch arrives with the news that Cleopatra is dead by her own hand. Mardian says she died calling Antony's name. After the eunuch leaves, Antony asks Eros to give him a moment alone. He resolves to kill himself, to rejoin his life. He calls Eros back, and orders him to kill him. To escape the duty of killing his beloved master, Eros kills himself. Antony falls on his sword, but the wound is not fatal. Decretas and three guards arrive, and ignore Antony's pleas to finish the job he started. Decretas remains when the guards leave, and takes Antony's sword, hoping to gain favor with Caesar by showing it to him. Diomedes enters, and Decretas leaves. Diomedes has been sent by Cleopatra to fetch Antony, because she feared he might do harm to himself. Some more guards arrive, and they carry Antony to her","Antony and Eros have returned to the palace, and Antony asks Eros if he can still see him. Eros doesn't understand the question, and so Antony explains; he describes himself as being like a shadow or a cloud, insubstantial yet taking on various shapes. He seems to be only a mere shadow of his former self because of his defeat by Caesar and because of what he assumes to be Cleopatra's treachery. Mardian enters and tells Antony that Cleopatra loved thee\") is dead, and that the last words that she spoke were \"Antony! most noble Antony!\" Antony is horribly shocked and instantly regrets his mistrust of her. He vows that he too will end his life. He calls Eros and commands him to kill him. Eros hesitates, and Antony pleads with him, saying that surely Eros would not wish to see him a captive of Caesar, defeated and shamed. Eros agrees, and he asks Antony to turn the other way so that he will not see Eros's sword. Antony does so, and Eros kills himself instead, after saying farewell to Antony. Antony, both abashed and impressed by Eros's courage and loyalty, follows his example and attempts to kill himself by falling upon his sword. Antony's sword, however, does not pierce him fatally. Hearing his cries, Dercetas and other soldiers enter, and although Antony begs them to kill him, no one will do so. Diomedes enters and finds Antony still alive. He tells Antony that Cleopatra has sent him word that she is, in fact, not dead -- that she lives. He explains that Cleopatra had hoped to defuse his rage by sending him word of her death, but then she feared that he might take his life. Thus she has sent Diomedes to tell Antony the truth. Antony calls for his guards and tells them to take him to Cleopatra.","Cleopatra returns to her maids with tales of Antony's murderous rage. Charmian suggests that her mistress lock herself in a monument and send Antony word that she has killed herself, to quell his anger.

He is about to send them away to find Jaques when Jaques appears. The Duke comments that Jaques looks positively merry. Jaques tells him, \\\"A fool, a fool, I met a fool i'th' forest, \/ A motley fool - a miserable world. As I do live by food, I met a fool\\\". Jaques describes meeting a man who lay on the ground and pulled out his watch. The fool commented that it was ten o'clock, that an hour before it had been nine, and in one hour it would be eleven. Jaques found the man to be so funny that he spent an hour laughing. He finally tells the Duke, \\\"O that I were a fool\\\". The Duke tells Jaques that he would only insult people if he had the license of a fool. Jaques claims that he would be witty and that men would only be insulted if they had done something for which they deserved to be insulted. He is interrupted by Orlando who enters with a drawn sword. Orlando rushes in and cries out, \\\"Forbear, and eat no more. He orders the men to give him food. The Duke politely bids Orlando to sit down and join them. He is taken aback by the Dukes reply and comments, \\\"Pardon me, I pray you. I thought that all things had been savage here\\\". Orlando then asks them to wait for him to get Adam so the old man may eat first. The Duke tells him they will not touch any of the food until he returns. Duke Senior remarks that the whole universe \\\"presents more woeful pageants than the scene \/ Wherein we play in\\\". Jaques replies with his famous speech starting: \\\"All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players. And one man in his time plays many parts, His act being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then, a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, . The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, . and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange, eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. After Jaques' speech, Orlando arrives bearing Adam on his shoulders and sets the older man down. Both of them thank the Duke for his hospitality. Amiens then sings a long song for them after which the Duke indicates that he knew Orlando's father quite well. He bids Orlando come to his cave and describe what has happened to him. Adam is helped away by the other lords\", \"analysis\": \"The character of old Adam is one of the most unique. In many ways Adam represents the old world, a world that is no longer in power but that cannot be forgotten. Adam agrees to follow Orlando into the forest, essentially indicating his dissatisfaction with the new world he is living in. When Orlando carries him, it marks a moment similar to Aeneas carrying Anchyses on his back, fleeing from burning Troy. It is thus with reverence that Adam gets treated by all the characters on account of his age and wisdom. The forest of Arden needs to be viewed a projection of the self, an intensifier of oneself. Duke Senior describes his men as being able to: \\\"Find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, \/ Sermons in stones, and good in everything\\\" . This is an image of the goodness of the Duke himself. However, Oliver comes across quite a different version of the forest later on in the play. He encounters snakes and lions, and he himself becomes long-haired and wild looking. Thus Arden appears differently to everyone in it depending on their personalities. In fact, this is quite apparent in 2.6 when we see Adam and Orlando walking around in a savage paradise, hungry for food. This contrasts with the banquet that Duke Senior is laying out for his men. Indeed, Orlando is the savage: \\\"Forbear, and eat no more!\\\" , he cries when he sees the food that Duke Senior has spread out on the ground. Surprised by the civility with which he is greeted, Orlando says, \\\"Pardon me, I pray you. \/ I thought that all things had been savage here\\\" . Orlando thinks he is in a savage place, yet the wilderness is more civilized than he is. The irony is that in this play the bestial man is found in the court, not the country. Jaques is perhaps the premier character for showing how Arden is a projection of the self. Jaques tells Duke Senior, \\\"A fool, a fool, I met a fool i'th' forest, \/ A motley fool - a miserable world! - As I do live by food, I met a fool\\\" . In reality he has met himself in the forest. Arden again is projecting his own attributes. This is further strengthened by the fact that Touchstone is a mirror for other people. Jaques \\\"foolishly\\\" then wishes to become a fool because licensed fools were allowed to say anything without fear of punishment. Shakespeare sets As You Like It in a pastoral setting, but he still mocks the pastoral mode of writing in the process. One of the fundamental aspects of pastoral is that the country people are simple and kindhearted. However, this is not the case when Rosalind and Celia meet Corin for the first time: \\\"But I am a shepherd to another man, \/ And do not shear the fleeces that I graze. \/ My master is of churlish disposition, \/ And little recks to find the way to heaven \/ By doing deeds of hospitality...there is nothing \/ That you will feed on\\\" . By denying the women hospitality, Shakespeare mocks the stereotype that rustic people give everything to strangers. A great deal of this play is constructed on paradoxes. Ganymede is really a woman who is in fact is really a male actor  playing a woman. Even more dramatically, we can state that the Forest of Ardenne has noble savages savaging nobles. Orlando is far more savage than the nobles he finds eating there, in spite of his noble upbringing. These paradoxes not only play with the notion of pastoral but also challenge gender identities. While no one would deny there is a paradox in being both a woman and a man, in Shakespeare's time the issue of gender was much looser than it is in modern society. Woman were considered anatomically identical to men except that the uterus was thought to be inverted male genitals. This view of sex allowed Shakespeare to have Rosalind, as Ganymede, pretend to again be Rosalind. Jaques gives his famous speech in this act, starting with, \\\"All the world's a stage...\\\" . This speech is important because all the characters and stages of life are described in terms of speaking: the lover sighs, the soldier is full of strange oaths, the old man loses his manly voice, and by the final stage the man cannot speak at all having lost everything. Speaking is therefore conceived of in terms of time passing. This vision of time progressing is part of what makes Jaques so melancholy. He views the end as being, \\\"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything\\\" , a sense of loss. However, regardless of what Jaques claims about old age, we have Adam to dismiss what Jaques says. Adam is clearly not without his teeth, eyes, taste or anything else except stamina. This is again Shakespeare at his best, showing the folly of Jaques by presenting Adam as living proof that Jaques is incorrect.\"}","chapter":"SCENE VII.\n\nThe forest\n\nA table set out.

A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,\n    A motley fool. A miserable world!\n    As I do live by food, I met a fool,\n    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\n    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\n    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.\n    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,\n    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'\n    And then he drew a dial from his poke,\n    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\n    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;\n    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;\n    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;\n    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;\n    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,\n    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;\n    And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear\n    The motley fool thus moral on the time,\n    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer\n    That fools should be so deep contemplative;\n    And I did laugh sans intermission\n    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!\n    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?\n\n  JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,\n    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,\n    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,\n    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit\n    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd\n    With observation, the which he vents\n    In mangled forms.

Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.\n\n  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;\n    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,\n    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;\n    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils\n    That thou with license of free foot hast caught\n    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.\n\n  JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride\n    That can therein tax any private party?\n    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,\n    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?\n    What woman in the city do I name\n    When that I say the city-woman bears\n    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?\n    Who can come in and say that I mean her,\n    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?\n    Or what is he of basest function\n    That says his bravery is not on my cost,\n    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits\n    His folly to the mettle of my speech?\n    There then! how then? what then?

True is it that we have seen better days,\n    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,\n    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes\n    Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;\n    And therefore sit you down in gentleness,\n    And take upon command what help we have\n    That to your wanting may be minist'red.\n\n  ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,\n    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,\n    And give it food. There is an old poor man\n    Who after me hath many a weary step\n    Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,\n    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,\n    I will not touch a bit.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR.

Adam is helped away by the other lords","summary_analysis":"The character of old Adam is one of the most unique. In many ways Adam represents the old world, a world that is no longer in power but that cannot be forgotten. Adam agrees to follow Orlando into the forest, essentially indicating his dissatisfaction with the new world he is living in. When Orlando carries him, it marks a moment similar to Aeneas carrying Anchyses on his back, fleeing from burning Troy. It is thus with reverence that Adam gets treated by all the characters on account of his age and wisdom. The forest of Arden needs to be viewed a projection of the self, an intensifier of oneself. Duke Senior describes his men as being able to: \"Find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, \/ Sermons in stones, and good in everything\" . This is an image of the goodness of the Duke himself. However, Oliver comes across quite a different version of the forest later on in the play. He encounters snakes and lions, and he himself becomes long-haired and wild looking. Thus Arden appears differently to everyone in it depending on their personalities. In fact, this is quite apparent in 2.6 when we see Adam and Orlando walking around in a savage paradise, hungry for food. This contrasts with the banquet that Duke Senior is laying out for his men. Indeed, Orlando is the savage: \"Forbear, and eat no more!\" , he cries when he sees the food that Duke Senior has spread out on the ground. Surprised by the civility with which he is greeted, Orlando says, \"Pardon me, I pray you. \/ I thought that all things had been savage here\" . Orlando thinks he is in a savage place, yet the wilderness is more civilized than he is. The irony is that in this play the bestial man is found in the court, not the country. Jaques is perhaps the premier character for showing how Arden is a projection of the self. Jaques tells Duke Senior, \"A fool, a fool, I met a fool i'th' forest, \/ A motley fool - a miserable world! - As I do live by food, I met a fool\" . In reality he has met himself in the forest. Arden again is projecting his own attributes. This is further strengthened by the fact that Touchstone is a mirror for other people. Jaques \"foolishly\" then wishes to become a fool because licensed fools were allowed to say anything without fear of punishment. Shakespeare sets As You Like It in a pastoral setting, but he still mocks the pastoral mode of writing in the process. One of the fundamental aspects of pastoral is that the country people are simple and kindhearted. However, this is not the case when Rosalind and Celia meet Corin for the first time: \"But I am a shepherd to another man, \/ And do not shear the fleeces that I graze. \/ My master is of churlish disposition, \/ And little recks to find the way to heaven \/ By doing deeds of hospitality...there is nothing \/ That you will feed on\" . By denying the women hospitality, Shakespeare mocks the stereotype that rustic people give everything to strangers. A great deal of this play is constructed on paradoxes. Ganymede is really a woman who is in fact is really a male actor  playing a woman. Even more dramatically, we can state that the Forest of Ardenne has noble savages savaging nobles. Orlando is far more savage than the nobles he finds eating there, in spite of his noble upbringing. These paradoxes not only play with the notion of pastoral but also challenge gender identities. While no one would deny there is a paradox in being both a woman and a man, in Shakespeare's time the issue of gender was much looser than it is in modern society. Woman were considered anatomically identical to men except that the uterus was thought to be inverted male genitals. This view of sex allowed Shakespeare to have Rosalind, as Ganymede, pretend to again be Rosalind. Jaques gives his famous speech in this act, starting with, \"All the world's a stage...\" . This speech is important because all the characters and stages of life are described in terms of speaking: the lover sighs, the soldier is full of strange oaths, the old man loses his manly voice, and by the final stage the man cannot speak at all having lost everything. Speaking is therefore conceived of in terms of time passing. This vision of time progressing is part of what makes Jaques so melancholy. He views the end as being, \"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything\" , a sense of loss. However, regardless of what Jaques claims about old age, we have Adam to dismiss what Jaques says. Adam is clearly not without his teeth, eyes, taste or anything else except stamina. This is again Shakespeare at his best, showing the folly of Jaques by presenting Adam as living proof that Jaques is incorrect.","summary_length":497.0,"analysis_length":839.0,"chap_int":7,"previous summary id":["act 2, scene 6","act 2, scene 6","scene 6","act ii, scene vi"],"previous chapter":["Adam has gotten tired and tells Orlando that he cannot walk any farther into the forest.

My lord, he is but even now gone hence;\n    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR.

He saves my labour by his own approach.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,\n    That your poor friends must woo your company?\n    What, you look merrily!\n\n  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,\n    A motley fool. A miserable world!\n    As I do live by food, I met a fool,\n    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\n    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\n    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.\n    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,\n    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'\n    And then he drew a dial from his poke,\n    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\n    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;\n    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;\n    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;\n    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;\n    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,\n    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;\n    And thereby hangs a tale.'

He asks that Adam hold off on dying until later since Orlando is going to all the trouble to rustle up some food for the old man.","In the last scene, we noted that a meal was being prepared for the duke and his men; in this scene, in contrast, no meal awaits Orlando and Adam as they wander through the forest. Adam says that he is too weak from hunger to go on, but his master comforts him by promising to find him a shelter and, afterwards, some food.","Orlando and Adam enter the Forest of Ardenne. Adam is exhausted from travel and claims that he will soon die from hunger. Orlando assures his loyal servant that he will find him food. Before he sets off to hunt, Orlando fears leaving Adam lying in \"the bleak air\" and carries him off to shelter"],"next summary id":"act 2, scene 7","next chapter":"Meanwhile, Duke Senior and his band of merry men are readying to settle down to dinner and they're looking for Jaques. Jaques arrives and, shockingly, he's in a good mood. Jaques says he ran into a \"motley fool\" in the forest. Hmm. Sounds like Jaques bumped into Touchstone out in the woods, don't you think? Apparently, Jaques hung out with the \"motley fool\" for about an hour and was amused by the guy's philosophical musings on the passage of time and the nature of women. Jaques bags on Touchstone and says that fools are the only people allowed to mock others without getting into trouble. Brain Snack: Jaques is talking about the freedom of being a \"licensed fool\" . A licensed fool is a guy who literally has a license to say whatever he wants without getting into trouble . Paid fools were pretty common in the households of royalty and the nobility in Shakespeare's day. Jaques says if he were a licensed fool, he could point out everybody's flaws and cure \"th'infected world\" of all its problems. Duke Senior's not buying any of it--he points out that Jaques is more likely to infect the entire world than to cure it. As Jaques responds to the Duke's insult, Orlando bursts in on the dinner party and yells \"Forebear, and eat no more!\" Jaques calls Orlando a \"cock\" and Duke Senior asks whether Orlando is distressed or just raised to have no manners. Orlando is hell-bent on stabbing somebody if they eat, though the Duke insists he should take it easy. Orlando can't take it easy, because he and Adam are starving. Still, he does apologize, saying everything in the forest is so brutish, he must have become brutish himself. The Duke understands, and he invites Orlando to eat with them. Everyone promises to wait while Orlando runs off to get Adam. Duke Senior takes the opportunity to comment that misery seems to be a universal experience. Jaques delivers the play's most famous speech and declares, \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\" He goes on to detail the seven ages of man, as follows: You start as an infant, then a whining schoolboy, progress to a lover, then a soldier, then a contented middle-aged man, followed by a kinda-old guy with spectacles, and finally a very, very old guy who has lost his senses and looks and acts like a helpless baby again. Just as Jaques is saying that old men are like infants, Orlando enters carrying his old servant, Adam... who is as helpless as a baby. The Duke doesn't want to bother them with questions before eating, so they all feast . Amiens sings a song about how even the harsh winter wind isn't as terrible as the way human beings can sometimes treat each other. During the song, Orlando whispers to Duke Senior that he is the son of Sir Rowland de Boys. The Duke recognizes old man Rowland's features in the boy and is delighted to have him. Duke Senior was a good friend of Sir Rowland, so he says Orlando and Adam are welcome in his cave anytime. The Duke says he wants to hear the story of how Adam and Orlando ended up homeless and hungry in the forest."}

Jaques describes, with evident delight, his meeting with Touchstone. He says that he wishes that he were a \\\"fool\\\" so that he might be able \\\"as the wind, \/ To blow on whom I please,\\\" exercising the fool's prerogative of speaking his mind freely to expose the world's abuses. But Jaques, as the duke notes, has a libertine past; this hardly qualifies him to reproach others for their failings. Their discussion abruptly ends when Orlando enters with his sword drawn. \\\"Forbear,\\\" he cries, \\\"and eat no more\\\" -- although the meal has scarcely begun. Orlando is calmed by the duke's courteous welcome, and he apologizes and sheathes his sword. Then, begging the duke to put off dining until his return, he goes to fetch Adam. This episode inspires Jaques' account of the seven ages of man. This extended philosophical statement has since become one of the most celebrated speeches in the Shakespearean canon. Most learned people in the Western world recognize the lines \\\"All the world's a stage \/ And all the men and women merely players.\\\" The point of view of the speech is colored by Jaques' cynicism, yet the speech itself has such imaginative power that it transcends Jaques' melancholy and causes one to pause and contemplate this schematic evaluation of man. According to Jaques, these are the seven ages of man: the infant: \\\"mewling and puking in the nurse's arms . . . \\\" the schoolboy: \\\"whining . . . with his satchel \/ And shining morning face, creeping like a snail, \/ Unwilling to school.\\\" the lover: \\\"sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad . . . to his mistress' eyebrow.\\\" the soldier: \\\"full of strange oaths . . . bearded . . . \/ Jealous in honour, sudden, and quick in quarrel, \/ Seeking the bubble's reputation \/ Even in the cannon's mouth.\\\" the justice : \\\"in fair round belly with good capon lin'd . . . eyes severe and beard of formal cut, \/ Full of wise saws and modern instances .\\\" the dotard : \\\"lean and slipper'd . . . \/ With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, \/ His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide \/ For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, \/ Turning again toward childish treble, pipes \/ And whistles in his sound. the senile, sick elder: \\\" second childishness and mere oblivion, \/ Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\\\" Despite Jaques' surface cynicism, Shakespeare's poetry is impressively sensitive and beautiful. This is Shakespeare at his most brilliant best. Orlando returns, just as Jaques finishes; he is carrying Adam, and as they begin eating, Amiens sings \\\"Blow, blow, thou winter wind.\\\" When the song ends, Duke Senior warmly welcomes \\\"the good Sir Roland's son\\\" and welcomes Adam as well. The scene ends happily; the duke takes old Adam's hand, and the group sets off for the duke's cave.\", \"analysis\": \"In no scene is the exaggerated melancholy and simple cynicism of Jaques more clearly evident than here. He opens his meeting with Rosalind's father by relating an encounter he has just had with Touchstone. In the encounter, Jaques was completely taken in by the clown. He was totally unaware that Touchstone was parodying Jaques' own style of speech. Instead, Jaques found Touchstone's remarks to be so profound that he wishes that he could be a fool himself. Touchstone's comments, thus, foreshadow Jaques' well-known \\\"Seven Ages of Man\\\" speech: 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripeAnd then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;And thereby hangs a tale.   One might also note that the sun dial that Touchstone produces is an unlikely, absurd instrument to use in a forest. That Jaques would use the sun dial to time his laughter, exactly the duration of one hour, underscores his ridiculous behavior, as if he or anyone could laugh for a specific amount of time. Jaques' character, unfortunately, has often been misunderstood. The duke, for example, calls him a \\\"libertine.\\\" The word at that time did not carry the moral connotations it does today. Then, it merely meant a man of the world. It must also be remembered that the duke likes to argue with Jaques , and in this scene, he is drawing Jaques out to discover what Jaques is thinking. He challenges Jaques' claim to be a reformer of society. Jaques accepts the challenge. The duke, of course, is being whimsically humorous and asks Jaques what he would \\\". . . disgorge into the general world,\\\" but Jaques obviously misses the duke's humorously exaggerated attack on his overblown pomposity. Instead, he immediately seizes the bait and rants on about how he would save society. In doing so, Jaques not only has the last word, but he also absurdly satirizes late sixteenth-century satirists. To some critics, the remark made by Orlando, \\\"yet am I inland bred \/ And know some nature,\\\" seems to contradict his speech in Act I, Scene 1. This is not the case. Both words \\\"civility\\\" and \\\"nurture\\\" meant good breeding in the general use of the term, rather than in the modern use of politeness, and it was considered good breeding to salute those whom one met. Orlando obviously does not salute when he makes his entrance. The duke challenges this impropriety. Jaques' division of life into seven ages was a proverbial, as well as a popular, idea in Elizabethan England. It is an ancient idea, and Shakespeare makes reference to it in The Merchant of Venice  and in Macbeth . Moreover, the speech is consistent with Jaques' character; it is highly generalized , and it is expressed in an untutored, insightful manner. Without Jaques realizing it, he becomes a one-man Chorus, delivering a keen philosophical discourse in capsule form. As a counter-balance to this philosophizing, both Jaques and Touchstone keep the audience from becoming too contemplative and also from becoming too involved with the fantasy of the forest; they serve as reminders that Duke Senior, Rosalind, and Orlando are playing only temporary parts in a masquerade in an unusual setting.\"}","chapter":"SCENE VII.\n\nThe forest\n\nA table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws\n\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;\n    For I can nowhere find him like a man.\n\n  FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;\n    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical,\n    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.\n    Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.\n\n                         Enter JAQUES\n\n\n  FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,\n    That your poor friends must woo your company?\n    What, you look merrily!\n\n  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,\n    A motley fool. A miserable world!\n    As I do live by food, I met a fool,\n    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\n    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\n    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.\n    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,\n    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'\n    And then he drew a dial from his poke,\n    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\n    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;\n    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;\n    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;\n    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;\n    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,\n    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;\n    And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear\n    The motley fool thus moral on the time,\n    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer\n    That fools should be so deep contemplative;\n    And I did laugh sans intermission\n    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!\n    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?\n\n  JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,\n    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,\n    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,\n    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit\n    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd\n    With observation, the which he vents\n    In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!\n    I am ambitious for a motley coat.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.\n\n  JAQUES. It is my only suit,\n    Provided that you weed your better judgments\n    Of all opinion that grows rank in them\n    That I am wise. I must have liberty\n    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,\n    To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;\n    And they that are most galled with my folly,\n    They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?\n    The why is plain as way to parish church:\n    He that a fool doth very wisely hit\n    Doth very foolishly, although he smart,\n    Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,\n    The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd\n    Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.\n    Invest me in my motley; give me leave\n    To speak my mind, and I will through and through\n    Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,\n    If they will patiently receive my medicine.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.\n\n  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;\n    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,\n    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;\n    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils\n    That thou with license of free foot hast caught\n    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.\n\n  JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride\n    That can therein tax any private party?\n    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,\n    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?\n    What woman in the city do I name\n    When that I say the city-woman bears\n    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?\n    Who can come in and say that I mean her,\n    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?\n    Or what is he of basest function\n    That says his bravery is not on my cost,\n    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits\n    His folly to the mettle of my speech?\n    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein\n    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,\n    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,\n    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,\n    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?\n\n             Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn\n\n\n  ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.\n\n  JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.\n\n  ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.\n\n  JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?\n    Or else a rude despiser of good manners,\n    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?\n\n  ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point\n    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show\n    Of smooth civility; yet arn I inland bred,\n    And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;\n    He dies that touches any of this fruit\n    Till I and my affairs are answered.\n\n  JAQUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force\n    More than your force move us to gentleness.\n\n  ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.\n\n  ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;\n    I thought that all things had been savage here,\n    And therefore put I on the countenance\n    Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are\n    That in this desert inaccessible,\n    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,\n    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;\n    If ever you have look'd on better days,\n    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,\n    If ever sat at any good man's feast,\n    If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,\n    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,\n    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;\n    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,\n    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,\n    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes\n    Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;\n    And therefore sit you down in gentleness,\n    And take upon command what help we have\n    That to your wanting may be minist'red.\n\n  ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,\n    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,\n    And give it food. There is an old poor man\n    Who after me hath many a weary step\n    Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,\n    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,\n    I will not touch a bit.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.\n    And we will nothing waste till you return.\n\n  ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!\n Exit\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:\n    This wide and universal theatre\n    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene\n    Wherein we play in.\n\n  JAQUES. All the world's a stage,\n    And all the men and women merely players;\n    They have their exits and their entrances;\n    And one man in his time plays many parts,\n    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,\n    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;\n    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel\n    And shining morning face, creeping like snail\n    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,\n    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\n    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\n    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,\n    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\n    Seeking the bubble reputation\n    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\n    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,\n    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\n    Full of wise saws and modern instances;\n    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\n    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\n    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\n    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide\n    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\n    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes\n    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\n    That ends this strange eventful history,\n    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;\n    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.\n\n                  Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM\n\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.\n    And let him feed.\n\n  ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.\n\n  ADAM. So had you need;\n    I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to.

According to Jaques, these are the seven ages of man: the infant: \"mewling and puking in the nurse's arms . . . \" the schoolboy: \"whining . . . with his satchel \/ And shining morning face, creeping like a snail, \/ Unwilling to school.\" the lover: \"sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad . . . to his mistress' eyebrow.\" the soldier: \"full of strange oaths . . . bearded . . . \/ Jealous in honour, sudden, and quick in quarrel, \/ Seeking the bubble's reputation \/ Even in the cannon's mouth.\" the justice : \"in fair round belly with good capon lin'd . . . eyes severe and beard of formal cut, \/ Full of wise saws and modern instances .\" the dotard : \"lean and slipper'd . . . \/ With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, \/ His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide \/ For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, \/ Turning again toward childish treble, pipes \/ And whistles in his sound. the senile, sick elder: \" second childishness and mere oblivion, \/ Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\" Despite Jaques' surface cynicism, Shakespeare's poetry is impressively sensitive and beautiful. This is Shakespeare at his most brilliant best. Orlando returns, just as Jaques finishes; he is carrying Adam, and as they begin eating, Amiens sings \"Blow, blow, thou winter wind.\" When the song ends, Duke Senior warmly welcomes \"the good Sir Roland's son\" and welcomes Adam as well. The scene ends happily; the duke takes old Adam's hand, and the group sets off for the duke's cave."}

He turns Amiens's song about the pleasures of leisurely life into a means of berating the foresters, and he comes close to playing the part of the fool, in the sense that he turns a critical eye on a world in which he lives but does not fully inhabit. But unlike Feste in Twelfth Night or the fool in King Lear, Jaques does not demonstrate the insight or wisdom that would make his observations truly arresting or illuminating. His most impressive speech in the play begins with a familiar set piece in Elizabethan drama: \\\"All the world's a stage, \/ And all the men and women merely players\\\" . He goes on to describe the seven stages of a man's life, from infancy to death, through his roles as lover and soldier, but Jaques's observations may strike us as untrue or banal. His estimation that lovers sigh \\\"like furnace, with a woeful ballad \/ Made to his mistress' eyebrow\\\" is humorous, and it certainly describes the kind of intemperate, undiscriminating affection that Silvius shows to Phoebe, or Phoebe to Ganymede . But the criticism seems ill-suited to a play as aware and forgiving of love's silliness as As You Like It. As a philosopher, Jaques falls short of accurately describing the complexity of Rosalind's feelings for Orlando; his musings bear the narrow and pinched shortcomings of the habitually sullen.  Jaques's sullenness blinds him to his own foolishness regarding life. Jaques goes on to describe man's later years, the decline into second childhood and obliviousness, without teeth, eyesight, taste, or anything else. Countering Jaques's unflattering picture of old age, Orlando carries Adam to the duke's banquet table, the old man entering his final years with his loyalty, generosity of spirit, and appetite intact. Although the thought of serving as Duke Frederick's fool appeals to him, Jaques ultimately lacks the wit, wisdom, and heart to perform the task. When he meets Touchstone in the forest, he sings the clown's praises, quoting with glee Touchstone's nihilistic musings on the passage of time: \\\"And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, \/ And then from hour to hour we rot and rot\\\" . Jaques does not realize that Touchstone's \\\"deep--contemplative\\\" speech is a bawdy mockery of his own brooding behavior . Indeed, throughout the play, Jaques remains so mired in his own moodiness that he sees very little of the world he so desperately wants to criticize. Knowing that Jaques's eyes are trained on men's baser instincts, the duke doubts Jaques's ability to serve as a proper and entertaining fool. Jaques, he feels, would be a boor, berating the courtiers for sins that Jaques himself has committed. This exchange points to an important difference between Jaques and the duke: the former is committed to being unhappy in the world and will suffer in it, while the latter is happy to make the best of the world he is given and will thrive, as the title of the play seems to promise.\"}","chapter":"SCENE VII.\n\nThe forest\n\nA table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws\n\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;\n    For I can nowhere find him like a man.\n\n  FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;\n    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical,\n    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.\n    Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.\n\n                         Enter JAQUES\n\n\n  FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,\n    That your poor friends must woo your company?\n    What, you look merrily!\n\n  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,\n    A motley fool. A miserable world!\n    As I do live by food, I met a fool,\n    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\n    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\n    In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.\n    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,\n    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'\n    And then he drew a dial from his poke,\n    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\n    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;\n    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;\n    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;\n    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;\n    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,\n    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;\n    And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear\n    The motley fool thus moral on the time,\n    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer\n    That fools should be so deep contemplative;\n    And I did laugh sans intermission\n    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!\n    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?\n\n  JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,\n    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,\n    They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,\n    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit\n    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd\n    With observation, the which he vents\n    In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!\n    I am ambitious for a motley coat.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.\n\n  JAQUES. It is my only suit,\n    Provided that you weed your better judgments\n    Of all opinion that grows rank in them\n    That I am wise. I must have liberty\n    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,\n    To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;\n    And they that are most galled with my folly,\n    They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?\n    The why is plain as way to parish church:\n    He that a fool doth very wisely hit\n    Doth very foolishly, although he smart,\n    Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,\n    The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd\n    Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.\n    Invest me in my motley; give me leave\n    To speak my mind, and I will through and through\n    Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,\n    If they will patiently receive my medicine.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.\n\n  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;\n    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,\n    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;\n    And all th' embossed sores and headed evils\n    That thou with license of free foot hast caught\n    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.\n\n  JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride\n    That can therein tax any private party?\n    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,\n    Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?\n    What woman in the city do I name\n    When that I say the city-woman bears\n    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?\n    Who can come in and say that I mean her,\n    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?\n    Or what is he of basest function\n    That says his bravery is not on my cost,\n    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits\n    His folly to the mettle of my speech?\n    There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein\n    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,\n    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,\n    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,\n    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?\n\n             Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn\n\n\n  ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.\n\n  JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.\n\n  ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.\n\n  JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?\n    Or else a rude despiser of good manners,\n    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?\n\n  ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point\n    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show\n    Of smooth civility; yet arn I inland bred,\n    And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;\n    He dies that touches any of this fruit\n    Till I and my affairs are answered.\n\n  JAQUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force\n    More than your force move us to gentleness.\n\n  ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.\n\n  ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;\n    I thought that all things had been savage here,\n    And therefore put I on the countenance\n    Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are\n    That in this desert inaccessible,\n    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,\n    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;\n    If ever you have look'd on better days,\n    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,\n    If ever sat at any good man's feast,\n    If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,\n    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,\n    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;\n    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,\n    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,\n    And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes\n    Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;\n    And therefore sit you down in gentleness,\n    And take upon command what help we have\n    That to your wanting may be minist'red.\n\n  ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,\n    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,\n    And give it food. There is an old poor man\n    Who after me hath many a weary step\n    Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,\n    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,\n    I will not touch a bit.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.\n    And we will nothing waste till you return.\n\n  ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!\n Exit\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:\n    This wide and universal theatre\n    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene\n    Wherein we play in.\n\n  JAQUES. All the world's a stage,\n    And all the men and women merely players;\n    They have their exits and their entrances;\n    And one man in his time plays many parts,\n    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,\n    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;\n    Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel\n    And shining morning face, creeping like snail\n    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,\n    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\n    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\n    Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,\n    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\n    Seeking the bubble reputation\n    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\n    In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,\n    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\n    Full of wise saws and modern instances;\n    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\n    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\n    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\n    His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide\n    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\n    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes\n    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\n    That ends this strange eventful history,\n    Is second childishness and mere oblivion;\n    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.\n\n                  Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM\n\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.\n    And let him feed.\n\n  ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.\n\n  ADAM. So had you need;\n    I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you\n    As yet to question you about your fortunes.\n    Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.\n\n                         SONG\n            Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\n            Thou art not so unkind\n              As man's ingratitude;\n            Thy tooth is not so keen,\n            Because thou art not seen,\n              Although thy breath be rude.\n    Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly.\n    Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.\n            Then, heigh-ho, the holly!\n              This life is most jolly.\n\n            Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\n            That dost not bite so nigh\n              As benefits forgot;\n            Though thou the waters warp,\n            Thy sting is not so sharp\n              As friend rememb'red not.\n    Heigh-ho! sing, &c.\n\n\n  DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,\n    As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,\n    And as mine eye doth his effigies witness\n    Most truly limn'd and living in your face,\n    Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke\n    That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,\n    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,\n    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.\n    Support him by the arm.
