The opposite applies for a prince who has just acquired a new state and attached it to his old one. In this case the prince must disarm the new state, for all arms must be in the hands of the prince's own soldiers - those who are used to his rule. Machiavelli disagrees with the adage that encouraging factionalism is a good way to keep power. Yes, this tactic may work in peacetime, but as soon as a foreign enemy comes along, the factionalized state is that much easier to conquer. Also, a faction can sometimes win out and overthrow the whole state, as has happened in Venice. Machiavelli approves of the deliberate planting of obstacles to a prince's rise and his power, in order for him to gain in reputation by overcoming them. \\\"Many hold that a shrewd prince will, when he can, subtly encourage some enmity to himself, so that by overcoming it he can augment his own reputation,\\\" he writes. Machiavelli then argues that men who are at first suspect to the prince can often be trusted more than those who seem immediately loyal to him; the former feel that they need to win the prince over, while the latter feel too secure in their positions. With a newly conquered state, \\\"it is much easier to gain as friends those men who were satisfied with the earlier state, and therefore hostile to the conqueror, than those men who, because they were discontented in the earlier state, looked with fervor on the new prince and helped him take over.\\\" The discontented often remain discontented. Machiavelli concludes this chapter, entitled \\\"Whether Building Fortresses and Other Defensive Policies Often Adapted By Princes Are Useful or Not,\\\" with a mention of, suitably enough, fortresses: \\\"the prince who fears his own people more than he does foreigners ought to build fortresses, but a prince who is more afraid of foreigners than of his own people can neglect them.\\\" Why? Because the best fortress of all is the support of the people. Moreover, a prince should never rely entirely on fortresses and feel that they mean he need not worry about whether or not his people support him. The next chapter, \\\"How a Prince Should Act to Acquire Reputation,\\\" presents Ferdinand of Spain as a key example. Ferdinand acquired his reputation through military projects, constantly following up one campaign with another - Granada, expelling the Moors, attacking Africa, campaigning in Italy, assaulting France - as a way of distracting from his more private machinations - unifying Aragon and Castille. Machiavelli refers to Ferdinand's behavior as \\\"despicable,\\\" yet he argues that these policies, by preoccupying the king's subjects and enthralling them, ultimately worked. A prince should take a stand if neighbors come to blows. Neutrality is not the way to go. If the neighbors are powerful, then the victor will invariably hate you if you were neutral; if the neighbors are weak, then you find yourself in an ideal position to render a state indebted to you by taking its side. Internally, a prince should reward the talents and endeavors of his subjects. He should encourage their work, should not confiscate holdings , should entertain the people with \\\"festivals and spectacles,\\\" and should show himself attentive to their needs while never diminishing his dignity. \\\"On a Prince's Private Counselors\\\" makes a more straightforward claim: that it is crucial for a prince to pick good ministers, because they in turn reflect on the prince himself. A good minister should think only of what is good for his master; that said, a prince should be sure to keep a minister obedient by honoring him and respecting his welfare. Next, Machiavelli turns to the subject of flatterers, in \\\"How to Avoid Flatterers.\\\" A prince should accept advice, but only when he has sought it out; uncalled-for advice is never welcome. A prudent prince will bring wise men into his council and give them alone \\\"free license to speak the truth.\\\" For his part, the prince should ask many questions, should seek opinions, and should hear out the views of others. The final three chapters of The Prince - \\\"Why the Princes of Italy Have Lost Their Dominions,\\\" \\\"The Influence of Luck on Human Affairs and the Ways to Counter It,\\\" and \\\"An Exhortation to Restore Italy to Liberty and Free Her From the Barbarians\\\" - return the book to that idealized vision: a unified Italy, brimming with renewed strength and vigor, a single nation rising above its divisions, healing its wounds, and striding like a colossus upon the world's stage. What has become of Italy's glorious potential? The problem, as Machiavelli identifies it, is essentially laziness. The rulers of Italy have not maintained their armed forces, idly figuring that quiet times never go away. This \\\"is a common failing of men,\\\" Machiavelli writes. They \\\"never think of storms so long as the sky is blue.\\\" When trouble comes, such princes run away, hoping to be called back when their former subjects tire of their conquerors. In the second of these three last chapters, Machiavelli discusses luck and its impact on political affairs. Italy is in trouble today, he argues, because of bad luck, but also because she has not guarded against it sufficiently. \\\"I think it may be true that Fortune governs half of our actions,\\\" Machiavelli writes, \\\"but that even so she leaves the other half more or less in our power to control.\\\" Machiavelli then closes The Prince with, as he puts it, an \\\"exhortation\\\": he directly addresses Lorenzo de Medici, as he did in the book's prefatory letter, arguing that he could be the prince who unites Italy. This hope for unification is echoed again in his mention of Cesare Borgia, who, \\\"at the zenith of his career deserted by Fortune.\\\" Machiavelli reminds Lorenzo to look at the examples of the past and restates the necessity of building one's own armies. \\\"The occasion must not be allowed to slip away,\\\" he argues. \\\"Italy has been waiting too long for a glimpse of her redeemer.\\\" Finally, Machiavelli concludes with a verse from Petrarch, translated as follows: \\\"Then virtue boldly shall engage\/And swiftly vanquish barbarous rage,\/Proving that ancient and heroic pride\/In true Italian hearts has never died.\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"Once again, Machiavelli's slippery, flip-flopping view of human nature is on full display. In Chapter XXI, he writes: \\\"Men are never so dishonest that they will show gross ingratitude by turning immediately on their helpers. Besides, victories are never so decisive that the victor does not have to maintain some moderation, some show of justice.\\\" Did he not, only a number of pages earlier, argue that men are intrinsically \\\"rotten,\\\" liars and hypocrites of the highest magnitude, ready to turn against a helping hand as soon as it suits their needs? And what of justice? What became of keeping the end in sight, of wielding cruelty when necessary, of aiming for the decisive victory, whatever the cost? No, Machiavelli reasons: moderation is the way to proceed. Far more than is generally assumed, The Prince adopts an almost thesis-antithesis approach to politics and human nature, arguing in near-dialectical fashion through the thickets of human behavior. Machiavelli, despite his occasional categorical assertion and broad generalization, tends to acknowledge the complexity of mankind, of social structures, and of civilization. The apparent contradictions that riddle The Prince are arguably indicative of an actively searching mind; this is a restless book, replete with gaps and back-tracks, obfuscations and impasses, that in its entirety seeks to offer a vision of man as a political animal, groping for power but continually off-set by his own contrary impulses. It is almost a study in psychology, teasing out the aforementioned contradictions in an effort to arrive at some synthesis. Indeed, man as agent of his own destiny is a central theme for Machiavelli. In his chapter on luck, he writes that \\\"a prince who depends entirely on Fortune comes to grief immediately she changes.\\\" That said, a prince should adjust his behavior \\\"to the temper of the times.\\\" It is all about finding the happy medium, that precise balance between absolute individualism and an ability to adapt to the winds of change and to the mood of the era. Luck does play a major role in politics. Men have natural inclinations that are not easily adjusted, and in this case it is a matter of chance whether such temperaments fit the times or not. But even here, in the heart of this argument, Machiavelli invokes the importance of the self, of man's capacity to introduce change and to mold the times. He writes that it is \\\"better to be rash than timid, for Fortune is a woman, and the man who wants to hold her down must beat and bully her.\\\" This statement assumes that Fortune can be held down - which was far from a universal belief in Machiavelli's time. He goes on: \\\"Like a woman, too,  is always a friend of the young, because they are less timid, more brutal, and take charge of her more recklessly.\\\" For all his prior emphasis on prudence and calculation, Machiavelli here prizes recklessness, boldness, and brutality. Therein lies perhaps the central struggle in The Prince: that between the need for bold, speedy maneuvers, the necessity of action, and the treatment of politics as a science, full of rules and conditions. A prince must be both human and beast, and as beast he must be both lion and fox. He must embrace the contradictions of humanity; he must rely on both thought and action; he must look to the past as he heads toward the future. Machiavelli's treatise is more than a prolonged letter intended to curry favor with the Medici or a how-to manual for power-grabbing; it is, fundamentally, an inquiry into the nature of man, and the ways in which that nature can be harnessed and used both for and against other men. The \\\"Prince\\\" of the title is neither hero nor villain. He is, quite simply, human.\"}","chapter":"\n1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their\nsubjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;\nothers have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid\nthemselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning\nof their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown\nand destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on all\nof these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states\nin which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as\ncomprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\n\n2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather\nwhen he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by\narming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted\nbecome faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your\nsubjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be\narmed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be\nhandled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they\nquite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,\nconsidering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and\nservice should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm\nthem, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either\nfor cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions\nbreeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it\nfollows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already\nshown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to\ndefend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore,\nas I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always\ndistributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince\nacquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then\nit is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have\nbeen his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and\nopportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should\nbe managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be\nyour own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\n\n3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed\nto say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by\nfortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their\ntributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.\nThis may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way\nbalanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept\nfor to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;\nrather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided\ncities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always\nassist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.\nThe Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the\nGuelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although\nthey never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these\ndisputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their\ndifferences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not\nafterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one\nparty at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,\ntherefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be\npermitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the\nmore easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if\nwar comes this policy proves fallacious.\n\n4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the\ndifficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore\nfortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who\nhas a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes\nenemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have\nthe opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a\nladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that\na wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster\nsome animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown\nmay rise higher.\n\n5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance\nin those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than\namong those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince\nof Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by\nothers. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies\nso much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who\nat the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of\na description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be\ngained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to\nserve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very\nnecessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had\nformed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from\nthem than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect\nhis affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a\nprince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he\nmust well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who\ndid so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only\ndiscontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly\nwith great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy\nthem. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which\ncan be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is\neasier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented\nunder the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of\nthose who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and\nencouraged him to seize it.\n\n6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states\nmore securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit\nto those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge\nfrom a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use\nof formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times\nhas been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he\nmight keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to\nhis dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the\nfoundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that\nwithout them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli\nreturning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore,\nare useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one\nway they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus:\nthe prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners\nought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners\nthan from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan,\nbuilt by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the\nhouse of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason\nthe best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because,\nalthough you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the\npeople hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist\na people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our\ntimes that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the\nCountess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed;\nfor by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait\nfor assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture\nof affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist\nthe people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when\nCesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied\nwith foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then\nand before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the\nfortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him\nwho builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame\nwhoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.\n\n     (*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and\n     Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the\n     Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envoy on 1499.\n     A letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the\n     appointment: \"I have been with the signori,\" wrote\n     Fortunati, \"to learn whom they would send and when. They\n     tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine\n     noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me\n     at once.\" Cf. \"Catherine Sforza,\" by Count Pasolini,\n     translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\n\n\n\n\nNothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting\na fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present\nKing of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he has\nrisen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the\nforemost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds\nyou will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the\nbeginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the\nfoundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without\nany fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile\noccupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;\nthus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power\nand authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and\nof the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the\nfoundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.\nFurther, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater\nschemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and\nclearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable\nexample, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,\nhe came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his\nachievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds\nof his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of\nthem. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other,\nthat men have never been given time to work steadily against him.\n\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal\naffairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano,\nwho, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some\nextraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of\nrewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about. And a\nprince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain\nfor himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\n\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a\ndownright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he\ndeclares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course\nwill always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two\nof your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character\nthat, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not.\nIn either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare\nyourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if\nyou do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to\nthe conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been\nconquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to\nprotect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want\ndoubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who\nloses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand,\ncourt his fate.\n\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive\nout the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of\nthe Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the\nRomans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed in\nthe council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to\nstand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which has\nbeen said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not\nto interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by\nnot interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the\nguerdon of the conqueror.\" Thus it will always happen that he who is not\nyour friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend\nwill entreat you to declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes,\nto avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are\ngenerally ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour\nof one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although\nthe victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is\nindebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are\nnever so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing\nyou. Victories after all are never so complete that the victor must not\nshow some regard, especially to justice. But if he with whom you ally\nyourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he\nmay aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.\n\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that\nyou have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it\ngreater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction\nof one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved\nhim; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your\nassistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be noted\nthat a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one\nmore powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless\nnecessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are\nat his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being\nat the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with France against\nthe Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could\nhave been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the\nFlorentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then\nin such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of\nthe parties.\n\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe\ncourses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,\nbecause it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid\none trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in\nknowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to\ntake the lesser evil.\n\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour\nthe proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his\ncitizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and\nagriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be\ndeterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away\nfrom him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the\nprince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and\ndesigns in any way to honour his city or state.\n\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles\nat convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into\nguilds or into societies,(*) he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and\nassociate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy\nand liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his\nrank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\n\n     (*) \"Guilds or societies,\" \"in arti o in tribu.\" \"Arti\" were\n     craft or trade guilds, cf. Florio: \"Arte . . . a whole\n     company of any trade in any city or corporation town.\" The\n     guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr\n     Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906).\n     Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\n     \"artel,\" exist in Russia to-day, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace's\n     \"Russia,\" ed. 1905: \"The sons . . . were always during the\n     working season members of an artel. In some of the larger\n     towns there are artels of a much more complex kind--\n     permanent associations, possessing large capital, and\n     pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual\n     members.\" The word \"artel,\" despite its apparent similarity,\n     has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \"ars\" or\n     \"arte.\" Its root is that of the verb \"rotisya,\" to bind\n     oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only\n     another form of \"rota,\" which now signifies a \"regimental\n     company.\" In both words the underlying idea is that of a\n     body of men united by an oath. \"Tribu\" were possibly gentile\n     groups, united by common descent, and included individuals\n     connected by marriage. Perhaps our words \"sects\" or \"clans\"\n     would be most appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they\nare good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the\nfirst opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is\nby observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and\nfaithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how\nto recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are\notherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error\nwhich he made was in choosing them.\n\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of\nPandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to\nbe a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there\nare three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;\nanother which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which\nneither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is\nthe most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless. Therefore,\nit follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he\nwas in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and\nbad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the\ninitiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant,\nand the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot\nhope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\n\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one\ntest which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his\nown interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in\neverything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever\nbe able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his\nhands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and\nnever pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study\nhim, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with\nhim the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he\ncannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,\nmany riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him\ndread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,\nare thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,\nthe end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\n\n\n\n\nI do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it\nis a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless\nthey are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of\nwhom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own\naffairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with\ndifficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they\nrun the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way\nof guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that\nto tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell\nyou the truth, respect for you abates.\n\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the\nwise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking\nthe truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,\nand of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and\nlisten to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions.\nWith these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry\nhimself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more\nfreely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of\nthese, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be\nsteadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either overthrown\nby flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls\ninto contempt.\n\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of\naffairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,\nsaid: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.\nThis arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the\nabove; for the emperor is a secretive man--he does not communicate his\ndesigns to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in\ncarrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are\nat once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being\npliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he\ndoes one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he\nwishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\n\n     (*) Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the\n     Holy Roman Empire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of\n     Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus\n     became involved in Italian politics.\n\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he\nwishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one\nfrom offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be\na constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the\nthings of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any\nconsideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be\nfelt.\n\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression\nof his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good\nadvisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because\nthis is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise\nhimself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his\naffairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man. In\nthis case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long,\nbecause such a governor would in a short time take away his state from\nhim.\n\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more\nthan one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to\nunite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and\nthe prince will not know how to control them or to see through them. And\nthey are not to be found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue\nto you unless they are kept honest by constraint. Therefore it must be\ninferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of\nthe wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good\ncounsels.\n\n\n\n\nThe previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince\nto appear well established, and render him at once more secure and fixed\nin the state than if he had been long seated there. For the actions of\na new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary\none, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind\nfar tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the\npresent than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy\nit and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a\nprince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will be a double\nglory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and\nstrengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good\nexample; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince,\nshall lose his state by want of wisdom.\n\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in\nItaly in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan,\nand others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in\nregard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in\nthe next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the\npeople hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known\nhow to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that\nhave power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\n\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who\nwas conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to\nthe greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a\nwarlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he\nsustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the\nend he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the\nkingdom.\n\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their\nprincipalities after so many years' possession, but rather their own\nsloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change\n(it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm\nagainst the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they\nthought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that\nthe people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall\nthem. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to\nhave neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never\nwish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to\nrestore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will\nnot be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which\ndoes not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and\ndurable that depend on yourself and your valour.\n\n\n\n\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the\nopinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by\nfortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and\nthat no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us\nbelieve that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let\nchance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times\nbecause of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and\nmay still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes\npondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.\nNevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that\nFortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,(*) but that she still\nleaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\n\n     (*) Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \"The older\n     one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty\n     King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this\n     miserable universe.\" Sorel's \"Eastern Question.\"\n\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood\noverflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away\nthe soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to\nits violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,\nthough its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when\nthe weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences\nand barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may\npass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so\ndangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour\nhas not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where\nshe knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain\nher.\n\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and\nwhich has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open\ncountry without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been\ndefended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either\nthis invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it\nwould not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning\nresistance to fortune in general.\n\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be\nseen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change\nof disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes\nthat have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who\nrelies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I believe also that\nhe will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of\nthe times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will\nnot be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end\nwhich every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there\nby various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force,\nanother by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one\nsucceeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of\ntwo cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly,\ntwo men by different observances are equally successful, the one being\ncautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than\nwhether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.\nThis follows from what I have said, that two men working differently\nbring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains\nhis object and the other does not.\n\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs\nhimself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a\nway that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if\ntimes and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course\nof action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know\nhow to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate\nfrom what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always\nprospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well\nto leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn\nadventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he\nchanged his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.\n\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and\nfound the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action\nthat he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against\nBologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians\nwere not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the\nenterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless\nhe personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness\nand energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute\nand passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover\nthe kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of\nFrance, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring\nto make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it\nimpossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action\naccomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have\ndone; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his\nplans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have\ndone, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would\nhave made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a\nthousand fears.\n\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they\nall succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience\nthe contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go\ncautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have\ndeviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\n\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind\nsteadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are\nsuccessful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider\nthat it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is\na woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and\nill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by\nthe adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She is,\ntherefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are\nless cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\n\n\n\n\nHaving carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and\nwondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to\na new prince, and whether there were elements that would give an\nopportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of\nthings which would do honour to him and good to the people of this\ncountry, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new\nprince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\n\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be\ncaptive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians\nshould be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the\nsoul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate\nthe capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to\ndiscover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy\nshould be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should\nbe more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians,\nmore scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,\ndespoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\n\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us\nthink he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was\nafterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him;\nso that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal\nher wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy,\nto the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse\nthose sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she entreats God\nto send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous\ninsolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a\nbanner if only someone will raise it.\n\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope\nthan in your illustrious house,(*) with its valour and fortune, favoured\nby God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could\nbe made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you\nwill recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named.\nAnd although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and\neach one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for\ntheir enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was\nGod more their friend than He is yours.\n\n     (*) Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal\n     by Leo X. In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the\n     title of Clement VII.\n\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is\nnecessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in\nthem. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness\nis great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those\nmen to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how\nextraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:\nthe sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured\nforth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to\nyour greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do\neverything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory\nwhich belongs to us.\n\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians\nhave been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious\nhouse; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns,\nit has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has\nhappened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us\nhave known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more than to\nestablish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen.\nSuch things when they are well founded and dignified will make him\nrevered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to\nbring such into use in every form.\n\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.\nLook attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior\nthe Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when it comes\nto armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from\nthe insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not\nobedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been\nany one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune,\nthat others would yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time,\nand during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there\nhas been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of\nitself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria,\nCapua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)\n\n     (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,\n     1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\n\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable\nmen who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,\nas a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your\nown forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better\nsoldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will\nbe much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,\nhonoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is\nnecessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended\nagainst foreigners by Italian valour.\n\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very\nformidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which\na third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied\nupon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the\nSwitzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close\ncombat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards\nare unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by\nSpanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot\nbe shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of\nRavenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions,\nwho follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility\nof body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the\nGermans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood\nhelpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been\nover with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both\nthese infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not\nbe afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but\na variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which\nconfer reputation and power upon a new prince.\n\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting\nItaly at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the love\nwith which he would be received in all those provinces which have\nsuffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for\nrevenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.\nWhat door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?\nWhat envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To all\nof us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your illustrious\nhouse take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all\njust enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native\ncountry may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that\nsaying of Petrarch:\n\n     Virtu contro al Furore\n     Prendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto:\n     Che l'antico valore\n     Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\n\n     Virtue against fury shall advance the fight,\n     And it i' th' combat soon shall put to flight:\n     For the old Roman valour is not dead,\n     Nor in th' Italians' brests extinguished.\n\n     Edward Dacre, 1640.\n\n\n","chapter_length":7000.0,"summary_name":"Section 7: Chapters XX-XXVI","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210417004655\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-prince\/study-guide\/summary-section-7-chapters-xx-xxvi","summary_text":"A new prince cannot disarm his subjects, which would cause a backlash; rather, he should arm them, thereby instilling loyalty. The opposite applies for a prince who has just acquired a new state and attached it to his old one. In this case the prince must disarm the new state, for all arms must be in the hands of the prince's own soldiers - those who are used to his rule. Machiavelli disagrees with the adage that encouraging factionalism is a good way to keep power. Yes, this tactic may work in peacetime, but as soon as a foreign enemy comes along, the factionalized state is that much easier to conquer. Also, a faction can sometimes win out and overthrow the whole state, as has happened in Venice. Machiavelli approves of the deliberate planting of obstacles to a prince's rise and his power, in order for him to gain in reputation by overcoming them. \"Many hold that a shrewd prince will, when he can, subtly encourage some enmity to himself, so that by overcoming it he can augment his own reputation,\" he writes. Machiavelli then argues that men who are at first suspect to the prince can often be trusted more than those who seem immediately loyal to him; the former feel that they need to win the prince over, while the latter feel too secure in their positions. With a newly conquered state, \"it is much easier to gain as friends those men who were satisfied with the earlier state, and therefore hostile to the conqueror, than those men who, because they were discontented in the earlier state, looked with fervor on the new prince and helped him take over.\" The discontented often remain discontented. Machiavelli concludes this chapter, entitled \"Whether Building Fortresses and Other Defensive Policies Often Adapted By Princes Are Useful or Not,\" with a mention of, suitably enough, fortresses: \"the prince who fears his own people more than he does foreigners ought to build fortresses, but a prince who is more afraid of foreigners than of his own people can neglect them.\" Why? Because the best fortress of all is the support of the people. Moreover, a prince should never rely entirely on fortresses and feel that they mean he need not worry about whether or not his people support him. The next chapter, \"How a Prince Should Act to Acquire Reputation,\" presents Ferdinand of Spain as a key example. Ferdinand acquired his reputation through military projects, constantly following up one campaign with another - Granada, expelling the Moors, attacking Africa, campaigning in Italy, assaulting France - as a way of distracting from his more private machinations - unifying Aragon and Castille. Machiavelli refers to Ferdinand's behavior as \"despicable,\" yet he argues that these policies, by preoccupying the king's subjects and enthralling them, ultimately worked. A prince should take a stand if neighbors come to blows. Neutrality is not the way to go. If the neighbors are powerful, then the victor will invariably hate you if you were neutral; if the neighbors are weak, then you find yourself in an ideal position to render a state indebted to you by taking its side. Internally, a prince should reward the talents and endeavors of his subjects. He should encourage their work, should not confiscate holdings , should entertain the people with \"festivals and spectacles,\" and should show himself attentive to their needs while never diminishing his dignity. \"On a Prince's Private Counselors\" makes a more straightforward claim: that it is crucial for a prince to pick good ministers, because they in turn reflect on the prince himself. A good minister should think only of what is good for his master; that said, a prince should be sure to keep a minister obedient by honoring him and respecting his welfare. Next, Machiavelli turns to the subject of flatterers, in \"How to Avoid Flatterers.\" A prince should accept advice, but only when he has sought it out; uncalled-for advice is never welcome. A prudent prince will bring wise men into his council and give them alone \"free license to speak the truth.\" For his part, the prince should ask many questions, should seek opinions, and should hear out the views of others. The final three chapters of The Prince - \"Why the Princes of Italy Have Lost Their Dominions,\" \"The Influence of Luck on Human Affairs and the Ways to Counter It,\" and \"An Exhortation to Restore Italy to Liberty and Free Her From the Barbarians\" - return the book to that idealized vision: a unified Italy, brimming with renewed strength and vigor, a single nation rising above its divisions, healing its wounds, and striding like a colossus upon the world's stage. What has become of Italy's glorious potential? The problem, as Machiavelli identifies it, is essentially laziness. The rulers of Italy have not maintained their armed forces, idly figuring that quiet times never go away. This \"is a common failing of men,\" Machiavelli writes. They \"never think of storms so long as the sky is blue.\" When trouble comes, such princes run away, hoping to be called back when their former subjects tire of their conquerors. In the second of these three last chapters, Machiavelli discusses luck and its impact on political affairs. Italy is in trouble today, he argues, because of bad luck, but also because she has not guarded against it sufficiently. \"I think it may be true that Fortune governs half of our actions,\" Machiavelli writes, \"but that even so she leaves the other half more or less in our power to control.\" Machiavelli then closes The Prince with, as he puts it, an \"exhortation\": he directly addresses Lorenzo de Medici, as he did in the book's prefatory letter, arguing that he could be the prince who unites Italy. This hope for unification is echoed again in his mention of Cesare Borgia, who, \"at the zenith of his career deserted by Fortune.\" Machiavelli reminds Lorenzo to look at the examples of the past and restates the necessity of building one's own armies. \"The occasion must not be allowed to slip away,\" he argues. \"Italy has been waiting too long for a glimpse of her redeemer.\" Finally, Machiavelli concludes with a verse from Petrarch, translated as follows: \"Then virtue boldly shall engage\/And swiftly vanquish barbarous rage,\/Proving that ancient and heroic pride\/In true Italian hearts has never died.\"","summary_analysis":"Once again, Machiavelli's slippery, flip-flopping view of human nature is on full display. In Chapter XXI, he writes: \"Men are never so dishonest that they will show gross ingratitude by turning immediately on their helpers. Besides, victories are never so decisive that the victor does not have to maintain some moderation, some show of justice.\" Did he not, only a number of pages earlier, argue that men are intrinsically \"rotten,\" liars and hypocrites of the highest magnitude, ready to turn against a helping hand as soon as it suits their needs? And what of justice? What became of keeping the end in sight, of wielding cruelty when necessary, of aiming for the decisive victory, whatever the cost? No, Machiavelli reasons: moderation is the way to proceed. Far more than is generally assumed, The Prince adopts an almost thesis-antithesis approach to politics and human nature, arguing in near-dialectical fashion through the thickets of human behavior. Machiavelli, despite his occasional categorical assertion and broad generalization, tends to acknowledge the complexity of mankind, of social structures, and of civilization. The apparent contradictions that riddle The Prince are arguably indicative of an actively searching mind; this is a restless book, replete with gaps and back-tracks, obfuscations and impasses, that in its entirety seeks to offer a vision of man as a political animal, groping for power but continually off-set by his own contrary impulses. It is almost a study in psychology, teasing out the aforementioned contradictions in an effort to arrive at some synthesis. Indeed, man as agent of his own destiny is a central theme for Machiavelli. In his chapter on luck, he writes that \"a prince who depends entirely on Fortune comes to grief immediately she changes.\" That said, a prince should adjust his behavior \"to the temper of the times.\" It is all about finding the happy medium, that precise balance between absolute individualism and an ability to adapt to the winds of change and to the mood of the era. Luck does play a major role in politics. Men have natural inclinations that are not easily adjusted, and in this case it is a matter of chance whether such temperaments fit the times or not. But even here, in the heart of this argument, Machiavelli invokes the importance of the self, of man's capacity to introduce change and to mold the times. He writes that it is \"better to be rash than timid, for Fortune is a woman, and the man who wants to hold her down must beat and bully her.\" This statement assumes that Fortune can be held down - which was far from a universal belief in Machiavelli's time. He goes on: \"Like a woman, too,  is always a friend of the young, because they are less timid, more brutal, and take charge of her more recklessly.\" For all his prior emphasis on prudence and calculation, Machiavelli here prizes recklessness, boldness, and brutality. Therein lies perhaps the central struggle in The Prince: that between the need for bold, speedy maneuvers, the necessity of action, and the treatment of politics as a science, full of rules and conditions. A prince must be both human and beast, and as beast he must be both lion and fox. He must embrace the contradictions of humanity; he must rely on both thought and action; he must look to the past as he heads toward the future. Machiavelli's treatise is more than a prolonged letter intended to curry favor with the Medici or a how-to manual for power-grabbing; it is, fundamentally, an inquiry into the nature of man, and the ways in which that nature can be harnessed and used both for and against other men. The \"Prince\" of the title is neither hero nor villain. He is, quite simply, human.","summary_length":1061.0,"analysis_length":630.0,"chap_int":26,"previous summary id":["chapter 25","chapter 25","chapter xxv"],"previous chapter":["Let's talk about luck. People feel like the world is just a Wheel of Fortune and they might as well give up because they can't do anything to change their luck. Well, Machiavelli says yeah, fortune is a real force, but just like we dam rivers and create earthquake resistant buildings, we can prepare for when bad luck strikes. The only people who get hit by \"bad luck\" are the ones who aren't prepared. That's how Italy got where it is. If they were prepared, it wouldn't matter if bad luck in the form of an occupation came knocking on their door. They would have been ready to deal with it. Some people might say that luck is what makes some people trying the same technique fail and others succeed. Nope. Machiavelli says that's just the circumstances. Sometimes certain techniques are good for certain circumstances, and sometimes they are not. It's up to a smart ruler to tell the difference, but that almost never happens. Look at Pope Julius II, our warrior pope. He jumped into everything he's ever done, and in his circumstances that was great. But what if circumstances changed? Things might not have turned out so well for him. Machiavelli ends with a weird sexist-style note about dominating fortune. Bottom line: when in doubt, be impulsive.","Many people believe that fortune controls everything, so that there is no use in trying to act, but fortune controls only half of one's actions, leaving free will to control the other half. Fortune can be compared to a river that floods, destroying everything in its way. But when the weather is good, people can prepare dams and dikes to control the flood. If Italy had such preparations, she would not have suffered so much in the present floods. Princes are successful one day and ruined the next, with no change in their natures. Two men may use the same method, but only one succeeds; and two men may use different methods, but reach the same goal, all because the circumstances do or do not suit their actions. If a man is successful by acting one way and the circumstances change, he will fail if he does not change his methods. But men are never flexible enough to change, either because their natures will not let them or because they become accustomed to a certain behavior bringing success. It is better to be bold than timid and cautious, because fortune is a woman, and the man who wants to control her must treat her roughly.","Concerning the Influence of Fortune in Human Affairs, and the Manner in Which It Is to Be Resisted Although it is often thought that fortune controls human affairs, fortune controls only half of one's actions, while free will determines the other half. Fortune is like a flooding river: it is only dangerous when men have not built dykes against it beforehand. Italy has not built dykes, and as a result it has experienced tumultuous upheaval. Germany, Spain, and France have taken better care and have reaped the benefits of stability. As fortune varies, one man may succeed and another fail, even if they both follow the same path. Times and circumstances change, so a prince must adjust to them in order to remain successful; however, men tend to stay on the course that has brought them success in the past. Circumstances allowed Julius II to act impetuously, but if he had lived longer, he would have been ruined when circumstances changed. On the whole, however, impetuosity surpasses caution. Fortune favors energetic youth over cautious age"],"next summary id":"section 7: chapters 20-26","next chapter":"A new prince cannot disarm his subjects, which would cause a backlash; rather, he should arm them, thereby instilling loyalty.

Machiavelli then argues that men who are at first suspect to the prince can often be trusted more than those who seem immediately loyal to him; the former feel that they need to win the prince over, while the latter feel too secure in their positions. With a newly conquered state, \"it is much easier to gain as friends those men who were satisfied with the earlier state, and therefore hostile to the conqueror, than those men who, because they were discontented in the earlier state, looked with fervor on the new prince and helped him take over.\" The discontented often remain discontented. Machiavelli concludes this chapter, entitled \"Whether Building Fortresses and Other Defensive Policies Often Adapted By Princes Are Useful or Not,\" with a mention of, suitably enough, fortresses: \"the prince who fears his own people more than he does foreigners ought to build fortresses, but a prince who is more afraid of foreigners than of his own people can neglect them.\" Why? Because the best fortress of all is the support of the people. Moreover, a prince should never rely entirely on fortresses and feel that they mean he need not worry about whether or not his people support him. The next chapter, \"How a Prince Should Act to Acquire Reputation,\" presents Ferdinand of Spain as a key example. Ferdinand acquired his reputation through military projects, constantly following up one campaign with another - Granada, expelling the Moors, attacking Africa, campaigning in Italy, assaulting France - as a way of distracting from his more private machinations - unifying Aragon and Castille. Machiavelli refers to Ferdinand's behavior as \"despicable,\" yet he argues that these policies, by preoccupying the king's subjects and enthralling them, ultimately worked. A prince should take a stand if neighbors come to blows. Neutrality is not the way to go. If the neighbors are powerful, then the victor will invariably hate you if you were neutral; if the neighbors are weak, then you find yourself in an ideal position to render a state indebted to you by taking its side. Internally, a prince should reward the talents and endeavors of his subjects. He should encourage their work, should not confiscate holdings , should entertain the people with \"festivals and spectacles,\" and should show himself attentive to their needs while never diminishing his dignity. \"On a Prince's Private Counselors\" makes a more straightforward claim: that it is crucial for a prince to pick good ministers, because they in turn reflect on the prince himself. A good minister should think only of what is good for his master; that said, a prince should be sure to keep a minister obedient by honoring him and respecting his welfare. Next, Machiavelli turns to the subject of flatterers, in \"How to Avoid Flatterers.\" A prince should accept advice, but only when he has sought it out; uncalled-for advice is never welcome. A prudent prince will bring wise men into his council and give them alone \"free license to speak the truth.\" For his part, the prince should ask many questions, should seek opinions, and should hear out the views of others. The final three chapters of The Prince - \"Why the Princes of Italy Have Lost Their Dominions,\" \"The Influence of Luck on Human Affairs and the Ways to Counter It,\" and \"An Exhortation to Restore Italy to Liberty and Free Her From the Barbarians\" - return the book to that idealized vision: a unified Italy, brimming with renewed strength and vigor, a single nation rising above its divisions, healing its wounds, and striding like a colossus upon the world's stage. What has become of Italy's glorious potential? The problem, as Machiavelli identifies it, is essentially laziness. The rulers of Italy have not maintained their armed forces, idly figuring that quiet times never go away. This \"is a common failing of men,\" Machiavelli writes. They \"never think of storms so long as the sky is blue.\" When trouble comes, such princes run away, hoping to be called back when their former subjects tire of their conquerors. In the second of these three last chapters, Machiavelli discusses luck and its impact on political affairs. Italy is in trouble today, he argues, because of bad luck, but also because she has not guarded against it sufficiently. \"I think it may be true that Fortune governs half of our actions,\" Machiavelli writes, \"but that even so she leaves the other half more or less in our power to control.\" Machiavelli then closes The Prince with, as he puts it, an \"exhortation\": he directly addresses Lorenzo de Medici, as he did in the book's prefatory letter, arguing that he could be the prince who unites Italy. This hope for unification is echoed again in his mention of Cesare Borgia, who, \"at the zenith of his career deserted by Fortune.\" Machiavelli reminds Lorenzo to look at the examples of the past and restates the necessity of building one's own armies. \"The occasion must not be allowed to slip away,\" he argues. \"Italy has been waiting too long for a glimpse of her redeemer.\" Finally, Machiavelli concludes with a verse from Petrarch, translated as follows: \"Then virtue boldly shall engage\/And swiftly vanquish barbarous rage,\/Proving that ancient and heroic pride\/In true Italian hearts has never died.\""}

Hence it is that for so long a time,\nand during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there\nhas been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of\nitself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria,\nCapua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)\n\n     (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,\n     1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\n\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable\nmen who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,\nas a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your\nown forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better\nsoldiers.

Therefore it is\nnecessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended\nagainst foreigners by Italian valour.\n\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very\nformidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which\na third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied\nupon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the\nSwitzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close\ncombat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards\nare unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by\nSpanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot\nbe shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of\nRavenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions,\nwho follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility\nof body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the\nGermans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood\nhelpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been\nover with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both\nthese infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not\nbe afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but\na variation upon the old.

People feel like the world is just a Wheel of Fortune and they might as well give up because they can't do anything to change their luck. Well, Machiavelli says yeah, fortune is a real force, but just like we dam rivers and create earthquake resistant buildings, we can prepare for when bad luck strikes. The only people who get hit by \"bad luck\" are the ones who aren't prepared. That's how Italy got where it is. If they were prepared, it wouldn't matter if bad luck in the form of an occupation came knocking on their door. They would have been ready to deal with it. Some people might say that luck is what makes some people trying the same technique fail and others succeed. Nope. Machiavelli says that's just the circumstances. Sometimes certain techniques are good for certain circumstances, and sometimes they are not. It's up to a smart ruler to tell the difference, but that almost never happens. Look at Pope Julius II, our warrior pope. He jumped into everything he's ever done, and in his circumstances that was great. But what if circumstances changed? Things might not have turned out so well for him. Machiavelli ends with a weird sexist-style note about dominating fortune. Bottom line: when in doubt, be impulsive.","Many people believe that fortune controls everything, so that there is no use in trying to act, but fortune controls only half of one's actions, leaving free will to control the other half. Fortune can be compared to a river that floods, destroying everything in its way. But when the weather is good, people can prepare dams and dikes to control the flood. If Italy had such preparations, she would not have suffered so much in the present floods. Princes are successful one day and ruined the next, with no change in their natures. Two men may use the same method, but only one succeeds; and two men may use different methods, but reach the same goal, all because the circumstances do or do not suit their actions. If a man is successful by acting one way and the circumstances change, he will fail if he does not change his methods. But men are never flexible enough to change, either because their natures will not let them or because they become accustomed to a certain behavior bringing success. It is better to be bold than timid and cautious, because fortune is a woman, and the man who wants to control her must treat her roughly.","Concerning the Influence of Fortune in Human Affairs, and the Manner in Which It Is to Be Resisted Although it is often thought that fortune controls human affairs, fortune controls only half of one's actions, while free will determines the other half. Fortune is like a flooding river: it is only dangerous when men have not built dykes against it beforehand. Italy has not built dykes, and as a result it has experienced tumultuous upheaval. Germany, Spain, and France have taken better care and have reaped the benefits of stability. As fortune varies, one man may succeed and another fail, even if they both follow the same path. Times and circumstances change, so a prince must adjust to them in order to remain successful; however, men tend to stay on the course that has brought them success in the past. Circumstances allowed Julius II to act impetuously, but if he had lived longer, he would have been ruined when circumstances changed. On the whole, however, impetuosity surpasses caution. Fortune favors energetic youth over cautious age"],"next summary id":"chapter 26","next chapter":"At the end of it all, Machiavelli has an appeal to Lorenzo de' Medici. Please take over Italy.

The Medici family can fill this role, if they will imitate the precepts Machiavelli has explained. Even signs from God point to their coming greatness. The other Italian princes never achieved this goal, because their old methods of warfare were unsound. There is no lack of courage or strength among the Italians, but their leaders are weak. For this reason, Italian armies have lost in the field for the last 20 years. If the Medici family want to become great leaders, they will raise their own armies. All the other European armies, despite their successes, have weaknesses that can be exploited with new strategies. Italy has been waiting for a savior to liberate her from oppression by the foreign barbarians. Let the Medici take up the cause, and Italy will be great once more.\", \"analysis\": \"The final chapter of The Prince is Machiavelli's exhortation to the Medici family to lead Italy out of foreign domination under a strong, centralized leadership. His tone is passionate and poetic, in contrast to the dry, direct style of the rest of the book. Still, Machiavelli slips back into his more familiar analytical style when discussing the various military techniques employed by the German, Swiss, French, and Spanish. Methods of warfare were another of Machiavelli's great interests. In 1520, he wrote an entire book on the subject in his Art of War . Machiavelli is at his most fervent when describing the bravery and strength of the Italian national spirit, and he rebukes the foolish leaders who have failed to make use of this great raw material. Even here, though, he has room for a small jab: The Italians, he says, fight well individually, but do not take well to authority, because they all think they know best. Another notable break with the rest of the book is the repeated invocation of God, who has been conspicuously absent from Machiavelli's discussion up until this point: Italy beseeches God for a redeemer, God favors the Medici, God wants the people to use free will, and God sends signs to show that the time is near. Machiavelli even refers to the man who was thought to have been ordained by God to save Italy, namely Cesare Borgia, who but for his rotten luck would have unified Italy. Italy still waits for this promised savior. The bitterness of Italy's subjugation to foreign powers runs throughout this final chapter. All of Machiavelli's observations and advice about the state and the prince have been directed toward this goal, to bring forth the leader who will liberate Italy from the barbarians and unify it. Then Italy will be the peaceful, prosperous state Machiavelli envisions, with a prince who works for the security and stability his subjects need.

His tone is passionate and poetic, in contrast to the dry, direct style of the rest of the book. Still, Machiavelli slips back into his more familiar analytical style when discussing the various military techniques employed by the German, Swiss, French, and Spanish. Methods of warfare were another of Machiavelli's great interests. In 1520, he wrote an entire book on the subject in his Art of War . Machiavelli is at his most fervent when describing the bravery and strength of the Italian national spirit, and he rebukes the foolish leaders who have failed to make use of this great raw material. Even here, though, he has room for a small jab: The Italians, he says, fight well individually, but do not take well to authority, because they all think they know best. Another notable break with the rest of the book is the repeated invocation of God, who has been conspicuously absent from Machiavelli's discussion up until this point: Italy beseeches God for a redeemer, God favors the Medici, God wants the people to use free will, and God sends signs to show that the time is near. Machiavelli even refers to the man who was thought to have been ordained by God to save Italy, namely Cesare Borgia, who but for his rotten luck would have unified Italy. Italy still waits for this promised savior. The bitterness of Italy's subjugation to foreign powers runs throughout this final chapter. All of Machiavelli's observations and advice about the state and the prince have been directed toward this goal, to bring forth the leader who will liberate Italy from the barbarians and unify it. Then Italy will be the peaceful, prosperous state Machiavelli envisions, with a prince who works for the security and stability his subjects need. Machiavelli closes the book with a quotation from the patriotic poem \"My Italy\"  by the great Italian poet Francesco Petrarca. Glossary Moses, Cyrus, Theseus the great leaders Machiavelli cited in Chapter 6, whom he presents here as liberators of oppressed peoples. head of the Church Giovanni de Medici, the newly elected Pope Leo X.

People feel like the world is just a Wheel of Fortune and they might as well give up because they can't do anything to change their luck. Well, Machiavelli says yeah, fortune is a real force, but just like we dam rivers and create earthquake resistant buildings, we can prepare for when bad luck strikes. The only people who get hit by \"bad luck\" are the ones who aren't prepared. That's how Italy got where it is. If they were prepared, it wouldn't matter if bad luck in the form of an occupation came knocking on their door. They would have been ready to deal with it. Some people might say that luck is what makes some people trying the same technique fail and others succeed. Nope. Machiavelli says that's just the circumstances. Sometimes certain techniques are good for certain circumstances, and sometimes they are not. It's up to a smart ruler to tell the difference, but that almost never happens. Look at Pope Julius II, our warrior pope. He jumped into everything he's ever done, and in his circumstances that was great. But what if circumstances changed? Things might not have turned out so well for him. Machiavelli ends with a weird sexist-style note about dominating fortune. Bottom line: when in doubt, be impulsive.","Many people believe that fortune controls everything, so that there is no use in trying to act, but fortune controls only half of one's actions, leaving free will to control the other half. Fortune can be compared to a river that floods, destroying everything in its way. But when the weather is good, people can prepare dams and dikes to control the flood. If Italy had such preparations, she would not have suffered so much in the present floods. Princes are successful one day and ruined the next, with no change in their natures. Two men may use the same method, but only one succeeds; and two men may use different methods, but reach the same goal, all because the circumstances do or do not suit their actions. If a man is successful by acting one way and the circumstances change, he will fail if he does not change his methods. But men are never flexible enough to change, either because their natures will not let them or because they become accustomed to a certain behavior bringing success. It is better to be bold than timid and cautious, because fortune is a woman, and the man who wants to control her must treat her roughly.","Concerning the Influence of Fortune in Human Affairs, and the Manner in Which It Is to Be Resisted Although it is often thought that fortune controls human affairs, fortune controls only half of one's actions, while free will determines the other half. Fortune is like a flooding river: it is only dangerous when men have not built dykes against it beforehand. Italy has not built dykes, and as a result it has experienced tumultuous upheaval. Germany, Spain, and France have taken better care and have reaped the benefits of stability. As fortune varies, one man may succeed and another fail, even if they both follow the same path. Times and circumstances change, so a prince must adjust to them in order to remain successful; however, men tend to stay on the course that has brought them success in the past. Circumstances allowed Julius II to act impetuously, but if he had lived longer, he would have been ruined when circumstances changed. On the whole, however, impetuosity surpasses caution.

It is seen how she entreats God\nto send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous\ninsolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a\nbanner if only someone will raise it.\n\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope\nthan in your illustrious house,(*) with its valour and fortune, favoured\nby God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could\nbe made the head of this redemption. This will not be difficult if you\nwill recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named.\nAnd although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and\neach one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for\ntheir enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was\nGod more their friend than He is yours.\n\n     (*) Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal\n     by Leo X. In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the\n     title of Clement VII.\n\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is\nnecessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in\nthem. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness\nis great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those\nmen to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how\nextraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:\nthe sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured\nforth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to\nyour greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do\neverything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory\nwhich belongs to us.\n\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians\nhave been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious\nhouse; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns,\nit has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has\nhappened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us\nhave known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man more than to\nestablish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen.\nSuch things when they are well founded and dignified will make him\nrevered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to\nbring such into use in every form.\n\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.\nLook attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior\nthe Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But when it comes\nto armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from\nthe insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not\nobedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been\nany one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune,\nthat others would yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time,\nand during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there\nhas been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of\nitself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria,\nCapua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)\n\n     (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,\n     1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\n\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable\nmen who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,\nas a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your\nown forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better\nsoldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will\nbe much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,\nhonoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is\nnecessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended\nagainst foreigners by Italian valour.\n\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very\nformidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which\na third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied\nupon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the\nSwitzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close\ncombat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards\nare unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by\nSpanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot\nbe shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of\nRavenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions,\nwho follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility\nof body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the\nGermans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood\nhelpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been\nover with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both\nthese infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not\nbe afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but\na variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which\nconfer reputation and power upon a new prince.\n\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting\nItaly at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the love\nwith which he would be received in all those provinces which have\nsuffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for\nrevenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.\nWhat door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?\nWhat envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To all\nof us this barbarous dominion stinks.

Mrs. Dashwood and her two remaining daughters spend most of their time at Delaford, both to be near Elinor, and out of the hope that Marianne might accept the Colonel.

There seems to be a certain softening toward her son here, in letting him marry against her will and allowing him money, both of which she refused to do before; yet, she covers up her giving-in with the look of being unpleasant and displeased. However, it seems that none of these less-than-pleasant characters have been taught anything in the course of the book. Robert is embraced by his mother again, just as he is; John Dashwood is still trying to get one of the girls to marry Colonel Brandon, so that he will never feel obligated to help them financially. Even Lucy is rewarded for being completely selfish and deceptive; it seems that only Marianne and Elinor have been tested, and their affections and characters cruelly tried. It is also ironic that Lucy is completely embraced by the family after all that has happened; but, being as selfish and flawed as the Ferrars family, perhaps it is natural that they should all get along.

It might well be expected that Elinor and Colonel Brandon become a couple, since they are best suited in character and temperament; however, Elinor ends up with the rather dull, though kind, Edward, of whom the reader learns little. It is Marianne and the Colonel who become a couple, which is somewhat dissatisfying; they have been infrequent company and know little of each other, yet the Colonel seems to love her because of her resemblance to a woman he once knew. Although Marianne becomes more cordial to the Colonel toward the end of the book, still, Austen must hurriedly add that she does come to love the Colonel on the last pages; we do not see any evidence of this affection, except what is told to us. This conclusion is too hasty to be truly satisfying, and might leave the reader's sympathies with Willoughby, the only man that Marianne is shown to love during the course of the novel.

For many years of\nher life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward\na few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of\nRobert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the\nresuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\n\nIn spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not\nfeel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his\npresent engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he\nfeared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off\nas rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution therefore it was\nrevealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness.  Mrs.\nFerrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\nMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss\nMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and\nenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\nof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only\nthe daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when\nshe found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\nrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\njudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and\ntherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\ndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\nissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to\nbe considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now\nher only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\nobjection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two\nhundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\nthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\nbeen given with Fanny.\n\nIt was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by\nEdward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\nthey had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\nliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\nan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\nconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\ncompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\nand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\ntill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\nchurch early in the autumn.\n\nThe first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the\nMansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the\nParsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could\nchuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings's\nprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for\nshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by\nMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really\nbelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact\nnothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,\nand rather better pasturage for their cows.\n\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations\nand friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was\nalmost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the\nexpense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\n\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\" said John, as\nthey were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\nHouse, \"THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one\nof the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I\nconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\nbrother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\nsuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not\nseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\nDelaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly\nthe person to attract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisable\nfor you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\nBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may\nhappen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of\nanybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off to\nadvantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her a\nchance--You understand me.\"--\n\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them\nwith the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by\nher real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,\nand the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many\nmonths had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had\nat first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of\nhis deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous\nattentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was\ngiven for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and\nre-established him completely in her favour.\n\nThe whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\ncrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance\nof what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however\nits progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and\nconscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately\nvisited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed\nto him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the\nengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle\nthe matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for\nthough Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her\nin TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to\nproduce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind when\nthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's\ndiscourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, and\nthe rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came\ngradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always\nmore to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an\ninterest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily\nevident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was\nproud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of\nmarrying privately without his mother's consent.  What immediately\nfollowed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at\nDawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and\nhe drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence\nreturning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the\nsimple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was\nadopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,\ncomprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and\ntherefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\nlonger unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and\nmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for\nthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\nnotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,\nby rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\nLucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;\nand while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended\nto marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,\nwas spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and\nalways openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in\ntown, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the\nbest terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the\njealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,\nin which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent\ndomestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing\ncould exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.\n\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\npuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to\nit, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,\nhowever, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing\never appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a\nsuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving\nhis brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward\nmight be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\nparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and\nfrom the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no\nless contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an\nexchange.\n\nElinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\nbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,\nfor her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with\nher.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure\nin the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing\nMarianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though\nrather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her\ndarling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her\nvalued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was\nequally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and\ntheir own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the\nreward of all.\n\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of\nhis goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,\nwhich at last, though long after it was observable to everybody\nelse--burst on her--what could she do?\n\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born to\ndiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\nconduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome an\naffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give\nher hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less\nthan herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years\nbefore, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought\nthe constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\n\nBut so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\npassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead\nof remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only\npleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and\nsober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen,\nsubmitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new\nhome, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\n\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\nbelieved he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past\naffliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,\nand his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own\nhappiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of\neach observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and her\nwhole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had\nonce been to Willoughby.\n\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of\nMrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as\nthe source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy\nand rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its\nown punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long\nthought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But\nthat he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or\ncontracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must\nnot be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, and\nfrequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,\nnor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\nand in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of\ndomestic felicity.\n\nFor Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving her\nloss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\nevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\nperfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\nin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\n\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\nattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.\nJennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an\nage highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being\nsupposed to have a lover.\n\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\nwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the\nmerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\nas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost\nwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreement\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2256.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 50","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210419170735\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/sense-and-sensibility\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-41-50","summary_text":"Edward is welcomed back by his mother, although he does not regain his inheritance from Robert.

There seems to be a certain softening toward her son here, in letting him marry against her will and allowing him money, both of which she refused to do before; yet, she covers up her giving-in with the look of being unpleasant and displeased. However, it seems that none of these less-than-pleasant characters have been taught anything in the course of the book. Robert is embraced by his mother again, just as he is; John Dashwood is still trying to get one of the girls to marry Colonel Brandon, so that he will never feel obligated to help them financially. Even Lucy is rewarded for being completely selfish and deceptive; it seems that only Marianne and Elinor have been tested, and their affections and characters cruelly tried. It is also ironic that Lucy is completely embraced by the family after all that has happened; but, being as selfish and flawed as the Ferrars family, perhaps it is natural that they should all get along. One would wish that this whole tribe might get their comeuppance, but instead \"nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together. They are all let off, unpunished but by having to endure as foolish, selfish people. Sense and Sensibility is not considered Austen's best novel because of the oddness of its conclusion. It might well be expected that Elinor and Colonel Brandon become a couple, since they are best suited in character and temperament; however, Elinor ends up with the rather dull, though kind, Edward, of whom the reader learns little. It is Marianne and the Colonel who become a couple, which is somewhat dissatisfying; they have been infrequent company and know little of each other, yet the Colonel seems to love her because of her resemblance to a woman he once knew. Although Marianne becomes more cordial to the Colonel toward the end of the book, still, Austen must hurriedly add that she does come to love the Colonel on the last pages; we do not see any evidence of this affection, except what is told to us. This conclusion is too hasty to be truly satisfying, and might leave the reader's sympathies with Willoughby, the only man that Marianne is shown to love during the course of the novel.

Edward admits that any regard he had for Lucy was formed out of idleness and lack of knowledge of the world; but during the four years they were engaged, he soon came to regret the match, although he could not break with Lucy in good conscience. The entire family is unbelievably happy that Edward got an honorable release from his engagement, and that Elinor and Edward are to be wed; Elinor is absolutely overcome, since she had expected him to be lost forever to her. Edward also reveals that after leaving London, he received a letter from Lucy saying that she had married his brother Robert, and has not seen her since. After receiving the letter, he also set out for Barton immediately, now at liberty to do as he had wished. Colonel Brandon soon comes to visit, and they are all at Barton for some time; Edward will still accept the position at Delaford, although he and Elinor still will not have enough money to live on comfortably. Edward and the Colonel become good friends, since they are suited in sense and temperament; Edward goes to Delaford with the Colonel to see his new home, and then decides to go to town to attempt reconciliation with his family, and hope to regain financial support from them.","Apparently, Edward had come to Barton to ask Elinor to marry him. He left the house so abruptly to get some fresh air, gained confidence, then returned immediately to accomplish his mission. Three hours later, everything is settled, and everyone is immensely happy. Yay! Edward is happier than they've ever seen him , and he's genuinely cheerful and open to everyone, especially Elinor. He explains what happened with his engagement to Lucy - they'd fallen in love as teenagers, but as grownups, they'd grown apart. Part of the problem was that he hadn't had a clear path to employment once he left school, and no companions or friends - really, the only person he was close to as a youth was Lucy, so he had no basis for comparison. That night, everyone is so excited that nobody can sleep. It's a good kind of excitement, though - that of pure joy and relief. Marianne can only express her joy through crying, and has no words for her feelings. Elinor was so excited that even she lost her composure for a moment, before she pulled it together and was able to tell him how much she loves him - still, she's far from the normal calm Elinor we're used to. Edward stays at the cottage for a week, and he and Elinor spend the whole time enjoying each other's company and planning for the future. Lucy's marriage to Robert is a topic of much discussion as well - how did it happen? Everyone is mystified. Edward and Elinor discuss the possibility of plotting on Lucy's part; they decide that she probably began with the best intentions of gaining Robert's good favor for her marriage to Edward, but things changed somewhere along the line. Edward tells Elinor all about his breakup with Lucy. She'd written him a rather awkward letter, after she and Robert were already married, and requested that he destroy all her letters. He was horrified by the badness of her writing, but pleased by the content - everyone agrees that all's well that ends well. Mrs. Ferrars has even got her comeuppance, since the very daughter-in-law she hoped to eliminate by disowning Edward has cropped up again with Robert. Edward hasn't been in contact with his family since this all happened, and he's not sure what is going to happen. Elinor realizes that Lucy had meant to deceive the Dashwoods and hurt Elinor in particular by leading Thomas to believe that she had married Edward, not Robert. It's clear that Lucy is not actually a nice girl, but clearly something of an evil one. He wishes he'd known about it before his mother found out about everything - he would have broken up with Lucy had he known her real nature. He can't imagine why Lucy stuck with him for so long - why would she have stayed with him, even when he was disowned? Elinor figures that Lucy probably thought that she could gain from the association anyway, and that she'd assumed that in the end his family would give in. Elinor teases him for spending so much time at Norland with her when he was otherwise engaged with Lucy, but she doesn't mean it. He earnestly defends himself, saying that he thought he was safe from falling in love with Elinor if he was engaged already. Needless to say, he was wrong. Edward is glad that Colonel Brandon is coming to visit. He's excited to get to know his benefactor better; he used to resent Colonel Brandon because he though the Colonel was engaged to Elinor and he'd assumed that that's why he was offered the job at Delaford. Now that everything's cleared up, though, he's excited to make a new friend. As for money, Elinor has a thousand pounds of her own, and Edward has two thousand - combined with the Delaford living, that doesn't give them quite enough to live on. Edward hopes that his mother might change her mind toward him, but Elinor's not so sure. It seems to her that Robert's offensive marriage will just mean that Fanny will get more of the Ferrars fortune. A few days after Edward arrives, Colonel Brandon shows up. Mrs. Dashwood is overjoyed that everyone's together, but it means that they're out of room at the cottage, and Colonel Brandon has to stay at Barton Park. However, he comes to visit every day. He's been much revived by his three weeks at home, and is even more revived by Marianne's improvement in health. Mrs. Dashwood tells him all the surprising news about Lucy and Robert, and the Colonel is especially happy that he's helped Edward and Elinor out. Edward and Colonel Brandon become great friends quickly, not only because they're quite similar in personality, but also because they're in love with two sisters. Mrs. Jennings sends a letter from town relating the whole story of Lucy and Robert, which Elinor is now able to read with humor, not anxiety. John also writes, lamenting how unfortunate Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny are. Both Robert and Lucy are in her bad book, and even if she un-disowns Robert, she'll never forgive Lucy. Mrs. Ferrars hasn't said anything about Edward yet, but John thinks that Edward should write a conciliatory note to his mother - perhaps she will forgive him . Edward isn't sure what to do and doesn't want to write, as John suggests, a letter of \"submission,\" so Elinor counsels him to write a letter asking for forgiveness, perhaps with a little humility thrown in there for good measure. Colonel Brandon and Edward leave together to visit Delaford, after which Edward will go to London.","That very afternoon the couple became engaged. Edward explained to Elinor how he had happened to become engaged to Lucy Steele, and how \"it was not, at the time, an unnatural or inexcusable piece of folly.\" He then showed her the letter that he had received from Lucy informing him that she felt he didn't really love her and that she had found someone who could in Robert. Colonel Brandon came for a short time, and letters from Mrs. Jennings and John Dashwood brought news once again of Robert's marriage to Lucy. John felt that Edward should send a letter of apology to Mrs. Ferrars, but Edward decided to go to London in person to see his sister Fanny and \"personally intreat her good offices in his favour,\" hoping that she might be able to bring about a reconciliation with his mother."],"next summary id":"chapter 50","next chapter":"Edward is welcomed back by his mother, although he does not regain his inheritance from Robert.

Edward receives a sum of ten thousand pounds, just as Fanny did when she got married. Edward and Elinor are pleased as punch, as they didn't expect that much. Now that they have an income, and a home provided by Colonel Brandon, they have everything they could possibly need. The pair is married in the fall at Barton church, then they move to Delaford. Mrs. Jennings comes to visit ASAP, and everyone is quite content. The only thing they could wish for is for Marianne and Colonel Brandon to get married. Everyone comes to visit Edward and Elinor, from Mrs. Ferrars to Fanny and John. John, embarrassingly, says that he's pleased for Elinor, but he clearly would have preferred having Colonel Brandon for a brother-in-law. Even though Mrs. Ferrars comes to visit, she's not a huge fan of Elinor. Against all odds, Robert and Lucy are restored to favor, and the treacherous Lucy becomes her mother-in-law's favorite. Lucy's self-interested actions come to light; she clearly lured Robert into marrying her under the guise of discussing her relationship with Edward. Robert is proud that he stole Lucy from his brother, but in fact, she manipulated both of them. Soon Lucy becomes essential to Mrs. Ferrars, as much so as John and Fanny. The Ferrars family politics are mysterious to everyone outside of the fold; despite being slighted by his mom, Edward is still happy with his circumstances.

Mrs.\nFerrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\nMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss\nMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and\nenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\nof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only\nthe daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when\nshe found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\nrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\njudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and\ntherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\ndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\nissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to\nbe considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now\nher only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\nobjection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two\nhundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\nthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\nbeen given with Fanny.\n\nIt was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by\nEdward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\nthey had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\nliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\nan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\nconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\ncompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\nand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\ntill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\nchurch early in the autumn.\n\nThe first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the\nMansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the\nParsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could\nchuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings's\nprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for\nshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by\nMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really\nbelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact\nnothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,\nand rather better pasturage for their cows.\n\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations\nand friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was\nalmost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the\nexpense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\n\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\" said John, as\nthey were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\nHouse, \"THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one\nof the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I\nconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\nbrother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\nsuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not\nseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\nDelaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly\nthe person to attract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisable\nfor you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\nBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may\nhappen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of\nanybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off to\nadvantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her a\nchance--You understand me.\"--\n\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them\nwith the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by\nher real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,\nand the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many\nmonths had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had\nat first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of\nhis deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous\nattentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was\ngiven for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and\nre-established him completely in her favour.\n\nThe whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\ncrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance\nof what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however\nits progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and\nconscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately\nvisited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed\nto him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the\nengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle\nthe matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for\nthough Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her\nin TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to\nproduce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind when\nthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's\ndiscourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, and\nthe rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came\ngradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always\nmore to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an\ninterest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily\nevident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was\nproud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of\nmarrying privately without his mother's consent.  What immediately\nfollowed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at\nDawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and\nhe drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence\nreturning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the\nsimple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was\nadopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,\ncomprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and\ntherefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\nlonger unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and\nmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for\nthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\nnotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,\nby rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\nLucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;\nand while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended\nto marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,\nwas spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and\nalways openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in\ntown, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the\nbest terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the\njealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,\nin which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent\ndomestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing\ncould exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.\n\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\npuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to\nit, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,\nhowever, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing\never appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a\nsuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving\nhis brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward\nmight be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\nparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and\nfrom the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no\nless contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an\nexchange.\n\nElinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\nbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,\nfor her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with\nher.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure\nin the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing\nMarianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though\nrather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her\ndarling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her\nvalued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was\nequally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and\ntheir own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the\nreward of all.\n\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of\nhis goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,\nwhich at last, though long after it was observable to everybody\nelse--burst on her--what could she do?\n\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born to\ndiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\nconduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome an\naffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give\nher hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less\nthan herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years\nbefore, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought\nthe constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\n\nBut so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\npassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead\nof remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only\npleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and\nsober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen,\nsubmitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new\nhome, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\n\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\nbelieved he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past\naffliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,\nand his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own\nhappiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of\neach observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and her\nwhole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had\nonce been to Willoughby.\n\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of\nMrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as\nthe source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy\nand rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its\nown punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long\nthought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But\nthat he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or\ncontracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must\nnot be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, and\nfrequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,\nnor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\nand in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of\ndomestic felicity.\n\nFor Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving her\nloss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\nevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\nperfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\nin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\n\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\nattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.\nJennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an\nage highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being\nsupposed to have a lover.\n\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\nwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the\nmerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\nas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost\nwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreement\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2256.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 50","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210421140324\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/sense-and-sensibility\/summary\/chapter-50","summary_text":"After working on his mother via letters for a while, Edward is allowed back into the Ferrars fold.

Edward admits that any regard he had for Lucy was formed out of idleness and lack of knowledge of the world; but during the four years they were engaged, he soon came to regret the match, although he could not break with Lucy in good conscience. The entire family is unbelievably happy that Edward got an honorable release from his engagement, and that Elinor and Edward are to be wed; Elinor is absolutely overcome, since she had expected him to be lost forever to her. Edward also reveals that after leaving London, he received a letter from Lucy saying that she had married his brother Robert, and has not seen her since. After receiving the letter, he also set out for Barton immediately, now at liberty to do as he had wished. Colonel Brandon soon comes to visit, and they are all at Barton for some time; Edward will still accept the position at Delaford, although he and Elinor still will not have enough money to live on comfortably. Edward and the Colonel become good friends, since they are suited in sense and temperament; Edward goes to Delaford with the Colonel to see his new home, and then decides to go to town to attempt reconciliation with his family, and hope to regain financial support from them.","Apparently, Edward had come to Barton to ask Elinor to marry him. He left the house so abruptly to get some fresh air, gained confidence, then returned immediately to accomplish his mission. Three hours later, everything is settled, and everyone is immensely happy. Yay! Edward is happier than they've ever seen him , and he's genuinely cheerful and open to everyone, especially Elinor. He explains what happened with his engagement to Lucy - they'd fallen in love as teenagers, but as grownups, they'd grown apart. Part of the problem was that he hadn't had a clear path to employment once he left school, and no companions or friends - really, the only person he was close to as a youth was Lucy, so he had no basis for comparison. That night, everyone is so excited that nobody can sleep. It's a good kind of excitement, though - that of pure joy and relief. Marianne can only express her joy through crying, and has no words for her feelings. Elinor was so excited that even she lost her composure for a moment, before she pulled it together and was able to tell him how much she loves him - still, she's far from the normal calm Elinor we're used to. Edward stays at the cottage for a week, and he and Elinor spend the whole time enjoying each other's company and planning for the future. Lucy's marriage to Robert is a topic of much discussion as well - how did it happen? Everyone is mystified. Edward and Elinor discuss the possibility of plotting on Lucy's part; they decide that she probably began with the best intentions of gaining Robert's good favor for her marriage to Edward, but things changed somewhere along the line. Edward tells Elinor all about his breakup with Lucy. She'd written him a rather awkward letter, after she and Robert were already married, and requested that he destroy all her letters. He was horrified by the badness of her writing, but pleased by the content - everyone agrees that all's well that ends well. Mrs. Ferrars has even got her comeuppance, since the very daughter-in-law she hoped to eliminate by disowning Edward has cropped up again with Robert. Edward hasn't been in contact with his family since this all happened, and he's not sure what is going to happen. Elinor realizes that Lucy had meant to deceive the Dashwoods and hurt Elinor in particular by leading Thomas to believe that she had married Edward, not Robert. It's clear that Lucy is not actually a nice girl, but clearly something of an evil one. He wishes he'd known about it before his mother found out about everything - he would have broken up with Lucy had he known her real nature. He can't imagine why Lucy stuck with him for so long - why would she have stayed with him, even when he was disowned? Elinor figures that Lucy probably thought that she could gain from the association anyway, and that she'd assumed that in the end his family would give in. Elinor teases him for spending so much time at Norland with her when he was otherwise engaged with Lucy, but she doesn't mean it. He earnestly defends himself, saying that he thought he was safe from falling in love with Elinor if he was engaged already. Needless to say, he was wrong. Edward is glad that Colonel Brandon is coming to visit. He's excited to get to know his benefactor better; he used to resent Colonel Brandon because he though the Colonel was engaged to Elinor and he'd assumed that that's why he was offered the job at Delaford. Now that everything's cleared up, though, he's excited to make a new friend. As for money, Elinor has a thousand pounds of her own, and Edward has two thousand - combined with the Delaford living, that doesn't give them quite enough to live on. Edward hopes that his mother might change her mind toward him, but Elinor's not so sure. It seems to her that Robert's offensive marriage will just mean that Fanny will get more of the Ferrars fortune. A few days after Edward arrives, Colonel Brandon shows up. Mrs. Dashwood is overjoyed that everyone's together, but it means that they're out of room at the cottage, and Colonel Brandon has to stay at Barton Park. However, he comes to visit every day. He's been much revived by his three weeks at home, and is even more revived by Marianne's improvement in health. Mrs. Dashwood tells him all the surprising news about Lucy and Robert, and the Colonel is especially happy that he's helped Edward and Elinor out. Edward and Colonel Brandon become great friends quickly, not only because they're quite similar in personality, but also because they're in love with two sisters. Mrs. Jennings sends a letter from town relating the whole story of Lucy and Robert, which Elinor is now able to read with humor, not anxiety. John also writes, lamenting how unfortunate Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny are. Both Robert and Lucy are in her bad book, and even if she un-disowns Robert, she'll never forgive Lucy. Mrs. Ferrars hasn't said anything about Edward yet, but John thinks that Edward should write a conciliatory note to his mother - perhaps she will forgive him . Edward isn't sure what to do and doesn't want to write, as John suggests, a letter of \"submission,\" so Elinor counsels him to write a letter asking for forgiveness, perhaps with a little humility thrown in there for good measure. Colonel Brandon and Edward leave together to visit Delaford, after which Edward will go to London.","That very afternoon the couple became engaged. Edward explained to Elinor how he had happened to become engaged to Lucy Steele, and how \"it was not, at the time, an unnatural or inexcusable piece of folly.\" He then showed her the letter that he had received from Lucy informing him that she felt he didn't really love her and that she had found someone who could in Robert. Colonel Brandon came for a short time, and letters from Mrs. Jennings and John Dashwood brought news once again of Robert's marriage to Lucy. John felt that Edward should send a letter of apology to Mrs. Ferrars, but Edward decided to go to London in person to see his sister Fanny and \"personally intreat her good offices in his favour,\" hoping that she might be able to bring about a reconciliation with his mother."],"next summary id":"chapter 50","next chapter":"After working on his mother via letters for a while, Edward is allowed back into the Ferrars fold.

Mrs.\nFerrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\nMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss\nMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and\nenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\nof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only\nthe daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when\nshe found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\nrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\njudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and\ntherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\ndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\nissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to\nbe considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now\nher only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\nobjection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two\nhundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\nthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\nbeen given with Fanny.\n\nIt was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by\nEdward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\nthey had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\nliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\nan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\nconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\ncompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\nand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\ntill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\nchurch early in the autumn.\n\nThe first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the\nMansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the\nParsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could\nchuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings's\nprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for\nshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by\nMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really\nbelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact\nnothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,\nand rather better pasturage for their cows.\n\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations\nand friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was\nalmost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the\nexpense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\n\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\" said John, as\nthey were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\nHouse, \"THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one\nof the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I\nconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\nbrother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\nsuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not\nseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\nDelaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly\nthe person to attract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisable\nfor you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\nBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may\nhappen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of\nanybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off to\nadvantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her a\nchance--You understand me.\"--\n\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them\nwith the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by\nher real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,\nand the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many\nmonths had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had\nat first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of\nhis deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous\nattentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was\ngiven for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and\nre-established him completely in her favour.\n\nThe whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\ncrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance\nof what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however\nits progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and\nconscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately\nvisited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed\nto him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the\nengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle\nthe matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for\nthough Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her\nin TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to\nproduce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind when\nthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's\ndiscourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, and\nthe rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came\ngradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always\nmore to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an\ninterest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily\nevident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was\nproud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of\nmarrying privately without his mother's consent.  What immediately\nfollowed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at\nDawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and\nhe drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence\nreturning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the\nsimple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was\nadopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,\ncomprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and\ntherefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\nlonger unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and\nmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for\nthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\nnotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,\nby rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\nLucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;\nand while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended\nto marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,\nwas spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and\nalways openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in\ntown, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the\nbest terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the\njealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,\nin which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent\ndomestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing\ncould exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.\n\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\npuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to\nit, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,\nhowever, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing\never appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a\nsuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving\nhis brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward\nmight be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\nparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and\nfrom the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no\nless contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an\nexchange.\n\nElinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\nbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,\nfor her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with\nher.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure\nin the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing\nMarianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though\nrather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her\ndarling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her\nvalued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was\nequally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and\ntheir own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the\nreward of all.\n\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of\nhis goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,\nwhich at last, though long after it was observable to everybody\nelse--burst on her--what could she do?\n\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born to\ndiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\nconduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome an\naffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give\nher hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less\nthan herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years\nbefore, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought\nthe constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\n\nBut so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\npassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead\nof remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only\npleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and\nsober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen,\nsubmitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new\nhome, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\n\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\nbelieved he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past\naffliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,\nand his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own\nhappiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of\neach observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and her\nwhole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had\nonce been to Willoughby.\n\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of\nMrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as\nthe source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy\nand rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its\nown punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long\nthought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But\nthat he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or\ncontracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must\nnot be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, and\nfrequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,\nnor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\nand in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of\ndomestic felicity.\n\nFor Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving her\nloss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\nevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\nperfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\nin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\n\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\nattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.\nJennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an\nage highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being\nsupposed to have a lover.\n\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\nwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the\nmerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\nas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost\nwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreement\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2256.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 50","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201101060302\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/s\/sense-and-sensibility\/summary-and-analysis\/chapter-50","summary_text":"Mrs. Ferrars was finally reconciled to Edward and gave him a settlement of ten thousand pounds: \"It was as much . . . as was desired, and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor.\" Robert procured the forgiveness of his mother \"by the simple expedient of asking it.\" Lucy, too, was clever enough to win the favor of her mother-in-law and was soon raised \"to the highest state of affection and influence.\" Elinor and Edward married and stayed at Colonel Brandon's house until the parsonage was ready.

Edward admits that any regard he had for Lucy was formed out of idleness and lack of knowledge of the world; but during the four years they were engaged, he soon came to regret the match, although he could not break with Lucy in good conscience. The entire family is unbelievably happy that Edward got an honorable release from his engagement, and that Elinor and Edward are to be wed; Elinor is absolutely overcome, since she had expected him to be lost forever to her. Edward also reveals that after leaving London, he received a letter from Lucy saying that she had married his brother Robert, and has not seen her since. After receiving the letter, he also set out for Barton immediately, now at liberty to do as he had wished. Colonel Brandon soon comes to visit, and they are all at Barton for some time; Edward will still accept the position at Delaford, although he and Elinor still will not have enough money to live on comfortably. Edward and the Colonel become good friends, since they are suited in sense and temperament; Edward goes to Delaford with the Colonel to see his new home, and then decides to go to town to attempt reconciliation with his family, and hope to regain financial support from them.","Apparently, Edward had come to Barton to ask Elinor to marry him. He left the house so abruptly to get some fresh air, gained confidence, then returned immediately to accomplish his mission. Three hours later, everything is settled, and everyone is immensely happy. Yay! Edward is happier than they've ever seen him , and he's genuinely cheerful and open to everyone, especially Elinor. He explains what happened with his engagement to Lucy - they'd fallen in love as teenagers, but as grownups, they'd grown apart. Part of the problem was that he hadn't had a clear path to employment once he left school, and no companions or friends - really, the only person he was close to as a youth was Lucy, so he had no basis for comparison. That night, everyone is so excited that nobody can sleep. It's a good kind of excitement, though - that of pure joy and relief. Marianne can only express her joy through crying, and has no words for her feelings. Elinor was so excited that even she lost her composure for a moment, before she pulled it together and was able to tell him how much she loves him - still, she's far from the normal calm Elinor we're used to. Edward stays at the cottage for a week, and he and Elinor spend the whole time enjoying each other's company and planning for the future. Lucy's marriage to Robert is a topic of much discussion as well - how did it happen? Everyone is mystified. Edward and Elinor discuss the possibility of plotting on Lucy's part; they decide that she probably began with the best intentions of gaining Robert's good favor for her marriage to Edward, but things changed somewhere along the line. Edward tells Elinor all about his breakup with Lucy. She'd written him a rather awkward letter, after she and Robert were already married, and requested that he destroy all her letters. He was horrified by the badness of her writing, but pleased by the content - everyone agrees that all's well that ends well. Mrs. Ferrars has even got her comeuppance, since the very daughter-in-law she hoped to eliminate by disowning Edward has cropped up again with Robert. Edward hasn't been in contact with his family since this all happened, and he's not sure what is going to happen. Elinor realizes that Lucy had meant to deceive the Dashwoods and hurt Elinor in particular by leading Thomas to believe that she had married Edward, not Robert. It's clear that Lucy is not actually a nice girl, but clearly something of an evil one. He wishes he'd known about it before his mother found out about everything - he would have broken up with Lucy had he known her real nature. He can't imagine why Lucy stuck with him for so long - why would she have stayed with him, even when he was disowned? Elinor figures that Lucy probably thought that she could gain from the association anyway, and that she'd assumed that in the end his family would give in. Elinor teases him for spending so much time at Norland with her when he was otherwise engaged with Lucy, but she doesn't mean it. He earnestly defends himself, saying that he thought he was safe from falling in love with Elinor if he was engaged already. Needless to say, he was wrong. Edward is glad that Colonel Brandon is coming to visit. He's excited to get to know his benefactor better; he used to resent Colonel Brandon because he though the Colonel was engaged to Elinor and he'd assumed that that's why he was offered the job at Delaford. Now that everything's cleared up, though, he's excited to make a new friend. As for money, Elinor has a thousand pounds of her own, and Edward has two thousand - combined with the Delaford living, that doesn't give them quite enough to live on. Edward hopes that his mother might change her mind toward him, but Elinor's not so sure. It seems to her that Robert's offensive marriage will just mean that Fanny will get more of the Ferrars fortune. A few days after Edward arrives, Colonel Brandon shows up. Mrs. Dashwood is overjoyed that everyone's together, but it means that they're out of room at the cottage, and Colonel Brandon has to stay at Barton Park. However, he comes to visit every day. He's been much revived by his three weeks at home, and is even more revived by Marianne's improvement in health. Mrs. Dashwood tells him all the surprising news about Lucy and Robert, and the Colonel is especially happy that he's helped Edward and Elinor out. Edward and Colonel Brandon become great friends quickly, not only because they're quite similar in personality, but also because they're in love with two sisters. Mrs. Jennings sends a letter from town relating the whole story of Lucy and Robert, which Elinor is now able to read with humor, not anxiety. John also writes, lamenting how unfortunate Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny are. Both Robert and Lucy are in her bad book, and even if she un-disowns Robert, she'll never forgive Lucy. Mrs. Ferrars hasn't said anything about Edward yet, but John thinks that Edward should write a conciliatory note to his mother - perhaps she will forgive him . Edward isn't sure what to do and doesn't want to write, as John suggests, a letter of \"submission,\" so Elinor counsels him to write a letter asking for forgiveness, perhaps with a little humility thrown in there for good measure. Colonel Brandon and Edward leave together to visit Delaford, after which Edward will go to London.","That very afternoon the couple became engaged. Edward explained to Elinor how he had happened to become engaged to Lucy Steele, and how \"it was not, at the time, an unnatural or inexcusable piece of folly.\" He then showed her the letter that he had received from Lucy informing him that she felt he didn't really love her and that she had found someone who could in Robert. Colonel Brandon came for a short time, and letters from Mrs. Jennings and John Dashwood brought news once again of Robert's marriage to Lucy. John felt that Edward should send a letter of apology to Mrs. Ferrars, but Edward decided to go to London in person to see his sister Fanny and \"personally intreat her good offices in his favour,\" hoping that she might be able to bring about a reconciliation with his mother."],"next summary id":"chapter 50","next chapter":"Mrs. Ferrars was finally reconciled to Edward and gave him a settlement of ten thousand pounds: \"It was as much . . . as was desired, and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor.\" Robert procured the forgiveness of his mother \"by the simple expedient of asking it.\" Lucy, too, was clever enough to win the favor of her mother-in-law and was soon raised \"to the highest state of affection and influence.\" Elinor and Edward married and stayed at Colonel Brandon's house until the parsonage was ready.

While she and Elinor are taking a walk one day, the subject of Willoughby is broached once again. Marianne admits that she behaved imprudently in her relations with him, but Elinor consoles her by relating Willoughby's confession. Marianne feels much better knowing that his abandonment of her was not the final revelation of a long-standing deceit, but rather the result of his financial straits, and was thus not entirely willed. Marianne also acknowledges that she would never have been happy with him anyway; he has proved himself rather lacking in integrity. Elinor shares Willoughby's confession with Mrs. Dashwood as well, who pities the man but cannot fully forgive him for his treatment of Marianne. Thomas, the Dashwoods' manservant, arrives from town with the news that \\\"Mr. Ferrars\\\" has married Lucy Steele. This news distresses both Elinor and Marianne: Marianne falls into a fit of hysterics, and Elinor appears deeply disappointed. Witnessing her eldest daughter's grief, Mrs. Dashwood wonders whether she ought to have paid closer attention to Elinor's feelings over the past several months. Not long after, Elinor thinks she sees Colonel Brandon approaching Barton Cottage on horseback, but upon closer look, she realizes that the visitor is actually Edward Ferrars. When he enters the house, and she and Marianne inquire about his recent marriage, he realizes the misunderstanding and assures them that it was Robert who married Lucy Steele. Elinor is so overcome by relief that she runs out of the room, unable to contain her tears of joy. Within the next three hours, Edward proposes to Elinor and she accepts, of course, with great happiness. Over dinner that evening, he explains the unfortunate circumstances that first led to his engagement to Lucy. Edward also shares with the Dashwood sisters a note from Lucy in which she informed him of her engagement to Robert and severed all romantic ties with him. When Colonel Brandon arrives at Barton and hears the news of their engagement, he graciously offers to improve the parsonage at Delaford  to accommodate the couple comfortably. Mrs. Ferrars ultimately reconciles herself to Edward's new situation, though she continues to favor Robert as if he were her eldest son. Elinor and Edward live together at Delaford and frequently invite both Marianne and Colonel Brandon to visit, in the hope that the two will form an attachment with one another. Their plan is successful, for the Colonel and the younger sister become engaged and move in with Elinor and Edward at Delaford. The sisters continue to maintain close ties with their mother and Margaret at Barton Cottage, and the families live happily ever after.\", \"analysis\": \"Commentary When the servant Thomas first announces the news of \\\"Mr. Ferrars's\\\" marriage to Lucy Steele, Marianne bursts out in hysterics while Elinor maintains her composure in spite of her deep disappointment. Their reactions are ironic on two levels. First, Elinor was the sister with a close attachment to Edward, and thus, she has far more cause to break down in tears. Second, not only do the sisters' reactions seem reversed from what they should be, but the reactions of the men under discussion are reversed as well : it is actually Robert, not Edward, who is engaged to Lucy Steele. Several critics have objected to the implausibility of the match between Marianne and Colonel Brandon. Brandon is characterized as a clear-headed, dependable, practical man--the total opposite of the romantic and impetuous Marianne. Thus, Marianne's final acceptance of him seems completely out of character, since the marriage requires her to abandon her romantic ideals entirely. Moreover, Marianne and Colonel Brandon barely interact in the novel, especially in the concluding chapters. Thus, it seems unlikely that Marianne would come to love Brandon as she had loved Willoughby; she hardly knows him. Nonetheless, by closing the novel with their marriage, Austen shows the extent of Marianne's transformation: she writes, \\\"She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract by her conduct her most favourite maxims. \\\" If Marianne's ability to love Brandon is unconvincing, it is because of Austen's great faith in the ability of the individual to remake herself in light of shifting circumstances. The novel closes with a reminder that the most important attachment in the novel is not that between any man and woman, but between the two sisters. The sisters decide to live side-by-side together with their husbands at Delaford, thereby affirming the mutual respect and affection, which has kept them close throughout the entire novel. Ultimately, both sisters end up married to the novel's only second sons. Edward Ferrars, although strictly speaking the firstborn, is disinherited by his mother; as John Dashwood remarks, \\\"Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son. \\\" We know that Colonel Brandon is a second son because he has an older brother who married his old sweetheart, Eliza, many years before the novel's plot begins. Whereas these characters are the heroes of the novel, all the eldest sons, including John Dashwood, Robert Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon's older brother, are cast in a negative light. In Austen's day, the eldest sons were the ones who inherited all the family property according to the laws of male primogeniture. However, in spite of these inheritance laws, it is the second sons who ultimately find contentment in the novel; thus, they make happy lives for themselves despite societal and financial constraints.\"}","chapter":"\n\nMarianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long\nenough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and\nher mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her\nto remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.\nPalmer's dressing-room.  When there, at her own particular request, for\nshe was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her\nmother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.\n\nHis emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in\nreceiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was\nsuch, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more than\nhis affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to\nothers; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many\npast scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance\nbetween Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened\nby the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,\nand the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.\n\nMrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but\nwith a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very\ndifferent effect, saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose\nfrom the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions\nand words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something\nmore than gratitude already dawned.\n\nAt the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger\nevery twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her\ndaughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER\nmeasures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not\nquit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon\nbrought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as\nequally determinate, if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs.\nJennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to\naccept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better\naccommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint\ninvitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature\nmade her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,\nengaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the\ncourse of a few weeks.\n\nThe day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking\nso particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly\ngrateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own\nheart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding\nColonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully\nassisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she\nshould engross at least half.  Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,\nand the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and\nfeel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise\nto take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young\ncompanions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his\nsolitary way to Delaford.\n\nThe Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey\non both, without essential fatigue.  Every thing that the most zealous\naffection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,\nwas the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward\nin her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits.  To Elinor, the\nobservation of the latter was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen\nher week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of\nheart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to\nconceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an\napparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted\nof serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and\ncheerfulness.\n\nAs they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every\nfield and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,\nshe grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their\nnotice, sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here, Elinor\ncould neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted\nMarianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an\nemotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,\nand in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the whole of her\nsubsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to\nreasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common\nsitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of\nresolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the\nsight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be\nconnected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,\nand though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without\nthe atonement of a smile.  After dinner she would try her piano-forte.\nShe went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an\nopera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\nfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his\nhand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head, put the music\naside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of\nfeebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring\nhowever with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice\nmuch.\n\nThe next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms.  On the\ncontrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked\nand spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of\nMargaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would\nthen be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the\nonly happiness worth a wish.\n\n\"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,\" said\nshe, \"we will take long walks together every day.  We will walk to the\nfarm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will\nwalk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;\nand we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its\nfoundations as far as we are told they once reached.  I know we shall\nbe happy.  I know the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to\nbe later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall\ndivide every moment between music and reading.  I have formed my plan,\nand am determined to enter on a course of serious study.  Our own\nlibrary is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond\nmere amusement.  But there are many works well worth reading at the\nPark; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can\nborrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six hours a-day, I shall\ngain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which\nI now feel myself to want.\"\n\nElinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;\nthough smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her\nto the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work\nin introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and\nvirtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she\nremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared\nshe had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of\nMarianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy\ntranquillity.  Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved\nto wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointed\nit.  But the resolution was made only to be broken.\n\nMarianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was\nfine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out.  But at last a\nsoft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's\nwishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's\narm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in\nthe lane before the house.\n\nThe sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an\nexercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had\nadvanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the\nhill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned\ntowards it, Marianne calmly said,\n\n\"There, exactly there,\"--pointing with one hand, \"on that projecting\nmound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.\"\n\nHer voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,\n\n\"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the\nspot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?\"--hesitatingly it\nwas said.--\"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now, I hope, as I\nought to do.\"--\n\nElinor tenderly invited her to be open.\n\n\"As for regret,\" said Marianne, \"I have done with that, as far as HE is\nconcerned.  I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been\nfor him, but what they are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on\none point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting\na part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all, if I could be assured\nthat he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied\nhim, since the story of that unfortunate girl\"--\n\nShe stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,\n\n\"If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.\"\n\n\"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--for not only is it\nhorrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, of\nsuch designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a\nsituation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could\nexpose me to\"--\n\n\"How then,\" asked her sister, \"would you account for his behaviour?\"\n\n\"I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle,\nvery, very fickle.\"\n\nElinor said no more.  She was debating within herself on the\neligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till\nMarianne were in stronger health;--and they crept on for a few minutes\nin silence.\n\n\"I am not wishing him too much good,\" said Marianne at last with a\nsigh, \"when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant\nthan my own.  He will suffer enough in them.\"\n\n\"Do you compare your conduct with his?\"\n\n\"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with\nyours.\"\n\n\"Our situations have borne little resemblance.\"\n\n\"They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not, my dearest Elinor, let\nyour kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure.  My\nillness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for\nserious recollection.  Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I\nwas perfectly able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my own\nbehaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last\nautumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of\nkindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had prepared my\nsufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me\nto the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by\nmyself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the\ntime to be wrong.  Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I\ndid not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such\nfeelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder\nthat the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for\natonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I\ndied,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my\nfriend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my\nlatter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should\nI have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have\nconsoled her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.  Whenever\nI looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing\nindulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.  The kindness, the\nunceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful\ncontempt.  To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every\ncommon acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart\nhardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very\nattention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as they\ndeserve, I had given less than their due.  But you,--you above all,\nabove my mother, had been wronged by me.  I, and only I, knew your\nheart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any\ncompassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before\nme; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort?\nDid I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking\nany part in those offices of general complaisance or particular\ngratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge\nalone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had\nbelieved you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or\nfriendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting\nonly THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for\nwhom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.\"\n\nHere ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,\nimpatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly\nthat praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well\ndeserved.  Marianne pressed her hand and replied,\n\n\"You are very good.--The future must be my proof.  I have laid down my\nplan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be\ngoverned and my temper improved.  They shall no longer worry others,\nnor torture myself.  I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my\nmother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will\nshare my affections entirely between you.  From you, from my home, I\nshall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix\nin other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, my\nheart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser\nduties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.  As for Willoughby--to\nsay that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle.\nHis remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or\nopinions.  But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion,\nby reason, by constant employment.\"\n\nShe paused--and added in a low voice, \"If I could but know HIS heart,\neverything would become easy.\"\n\nElinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or\nimpropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all\nnearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as\nreflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself\nleading to the fact.\n\nShe managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her\nanxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief\npoints on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his\nrepentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.\nMarianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the\nground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them.  A\nthousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge\none.  She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,\nunknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears covered\nher cheeks.\n\nElinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they\nreached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity\nmust be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing\nbut Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully\nminute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could\nbe safely indulged.  As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a\nkiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her\ntears, \"Tell mama,\" withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up\nstairs.  Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable\nas what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its\nresult, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne\nfail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting\ninjunction.\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former\nfavourite.  She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his\nimputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the\nfeelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him\nwith a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne.  Nothing\ncould do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his\nmeans, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.  Nothing\ncould replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the\ninterests of Colonel Brandon.\n\nHad Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story from\nhimself--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence\nof his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion\nwould have been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in\nher wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed\nexplanation, as had at first been called forth in herself.  Reflection\nhad given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of\nWilloughby's deserts;--she wished, therefore, to declare only the\nsimple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his\ncharacter, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy\nastray.\n\nIn the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began\nvoluntarily to speak of him again;--but that it was not without an\neffort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for\nsome time previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--and her\nunsteady voice, plainly shewed.\n\n\"I wish to assure you both,\" said she, \"that I see every thing--as you\ncan desire me to do.\"\n\nMrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing\ntenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister's\nunbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence.  Marianne\nslowly continued--\n\n\"It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have\nnow heard exactly what I wished to hear.\"--For some moments her voice\nwas lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness\nthan before--\"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change.  I\nnever could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later\nI must have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence, no\nesteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.\"\n\n\"I know it--I know it,\" cried her mother.  \"Happy with a man of\nlibertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest\nof our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heart\nto be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitive\nconscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband\nought to have felt.\"\n\nMarianne sighed, and repeated, \"I wish for no change.\"\n\n\"You consider the matter,\" said Elinor, \"exactly as a good mind and a\nsound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as\nwell as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,\nreason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you\nin many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have\nbeen poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.\nHad you married, you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is\nacknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that\nself-denial is a word hardly understood by him.  His demands and your\ninexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought\non distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having\nbeen entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense of honour\nand honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation,\nto attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and,\nperhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,\nyou might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and how\nlittle could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin\nwhich had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had you\nendeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not\nto be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to\nconsent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,\nand made him regret the connection which had involved him in such\ndifficulties?\"\n\nMarianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word \"Selfish?\" in a\ntone that implied--\"do you really think him selfish?\"\n\n\"The whole of his behaviour,\" replied Elinor, \"from the beginning to\nthe end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.  It was\nselfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which\nafterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of\nit, and which finally carried him from Barton.  His own enjoyment, or\nhis own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.\"\n\n\"It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.\"\n\n\"At present,\" continued Elinor, \"he regrets what he has done.  And why\ndoes he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards\nhimself.  It has not made him happy.  His circumstances are now\nunembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\nthat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.\nBut does it follow that had he married you, he would have been\nhappy?--The inconveniences would have been different.  He would then\nhave suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are\nremoved, he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife of whose\ntemper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always\nnecessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank\nthe innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far\nmore importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a\nwife.\"\n\n\"I have not a doubt of it,\" said Marianne; \"and I have nothing to\nregret--nothing but my own folly.\"\n\n\"Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,\" said Mrs. Dashwood;\n\"SHE must be answerable.\"\n\nMarianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each\nfelt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might\nweaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first\nsubject, immediately continued,\n\n\"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the\nstory--that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first\noffence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime\nhas been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present\ndiscontents.\"\n\nMarianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led\nby it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warm\nas friendship and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did not\nlook, however, as if much of it were heard by her.\n\nElinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following\ndays, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done;\nbut while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear\ncheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time\nupon her health.\n\nMargaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each\nother, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their\nusual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to\nBarton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.\n\nElinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.  She had heard\nnothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,\nnothing certain even of his present abode.  Some letters had passed\nbetween her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and\nin the first of John's, there had been this sentence:-- \"We know\nnothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so\nprohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford;\" which\nwas all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,\nfor his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.\nShe was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.\n\nTheir man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and\nwhen, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his\nmistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary\ncommunication--\n\n\"I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.\"\n\nMarianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her\nturning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood,\nwhose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively\ntaken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's\ncountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,\nalike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to\nbestow her principal attention.\n\nThe servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense\nenough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance,\nsupported her into the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather\nbetter, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the\nmaid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far\nrecovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an\ninquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood\nimmediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the\nbenefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.\n\n\"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?\"\n\n\"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady\ntoo, Miss Steele as was.  They was stopping in a chaise at the door of\nthe New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the\nPark to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up\nas I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss\nSteele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and\ninquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss\nMarianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,\ntheir best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not\ntime to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go\nforwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but\nhowsever, when they come back, they'd make sure to come and see you.\"\n\n\"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since\nshe was in these parts.  She was always a very affable and free-spoken\nyoung lady, and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.\"\n\n\"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look\nup;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.\"\n\nElinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself\nforward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.\n\n\"Was there no one else in the carriage?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, only they two.\"\n\n\"Do you know where they came from?\"\n\n\"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.\"\n\n\"And are they going farther westward?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon be back again, and\nthen they'd be sure and call here.\"\n\nMrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than\nto expect them.  She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and\nwas very confident that Edward would never come near them.  She\nobserved in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going\ndown to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.\n\nThomas's intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked as if she wished to\nhear more.\n\n\"Did you see them off, before you came away?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any\nlonger; I was afraid of being late.\"\n\n\"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was\nalways a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented.\"\n\nMrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the\ntablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.\nMarianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.\nMrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret\nmight think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both\nher sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often\nhad to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to go\nwithout her dinner before.\n\nWhen the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and\nElinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a\nsimilarity of thoughtfulness and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to\nhazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation.  She now\nfound that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of\nherself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly\nsoftened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,\nsuffering as she then had suffered for Marianne.  She found that she\nhad been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her\ndaughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well\nunderstood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to\nbelieve, or than it was now proved to be.  She feared that under this\npersuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her\nElinor;--that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, more\nimmediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and led\nher away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering\nalmost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greater\nfortitude.\n\n\n\n\nElinor now found the difference between the expectation of an\nunpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,\nand certainty itself.  She now found, that in spite of herself, she had\nalways admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something\nwould occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his\nown, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of\nestablishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.\nBut he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking\nflattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.\n\nThat he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be in\norders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the\nliving, surprised her a little at first.  But she soon saw how likely\nit was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure\nhim, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.  They were\nmarried, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle's.  What\nhad Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her\nmother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!\n\nThey would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--that\nplace in which so much conspired to give her an interest; which she\nwished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.  She saw them\nin an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active,\ncontriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with\nthe utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her\neconomical practices;--pursuing her own interest in every thought,\ncourting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every\nwealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw, nor what she\nwished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her; she turned away\nher head from every sketch of him.\n\nElinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London\nwould write to them to announce the event, and give farther\nparticulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no\ntidings.  Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault\nwith every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless or indolent.\n\n\"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?\" was an inquiry which\nsprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.\n\n\"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to\nhear from him again.  I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should\nnot be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.\"\n\nThis was gaining something, something to look forward to.  Colonel\nBrandon must have some information to give.\n\nScarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on\nhorseback drew her eyes to the window.  He stopt at their gate.  It was\na gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;\nand she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was NOT Colonel\nBrandon--neither his air--nor his height.  Were it possible, she must\nsay it must be Edward.  She looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she\ncould not be mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.\n\"He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us.  I WILL be calm; I WILL\nbe mistress of myself.\"\n\nIn a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the\nmistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look\nat herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.  She would have\ngiven the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that\nshe hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to\nhim;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their\nown discretion.\n\nNot a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited in silence for the\nappearance of their visitor.  His footsteps were heard along the gravel\npath; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before\nthem.\n\nHis countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for\nElinor.  His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if\nfearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.\nMrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of\nthat daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be\nguided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him\nher hand, and wished him joy.\n\nHe coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.  Elinor's lips\nhad moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of action was over,\nshe wished that she had shaken hands with him too.  But it was then too\nlate, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again and\ntalked of the weather.\n\nMarianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her\ndistress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of\nthe case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore\ntook a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strict\nsilence.\n\nWhen Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very\nawful pause took place.  It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who\nfelt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a\nhurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.\n\nAnother pause.\n\nElinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own\nvoice, now said,\n\n\"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?\"\n\n\"At Longstaple!\" he replied, with an air of surprise.-- \"No, my mother\nis in town.\"\n\n\"I meant,\" said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, \"to inquire\nfor Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.\"\n\nShe dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their\neyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,\nafter some hesitation, said,--\n\n\"Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!\"--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an\naccent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,\neven HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder.  He\nrose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not\nknowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and\nwhile spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to\npieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,\n\n\"Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is\nlately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.\"\n\nHis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,\nwho sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such\nagitation as made her hardly know where she was.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.\"\n\nElinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran out of the room, and as\nsoon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first\nshe thought would never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any\nwhere, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--or even\nheard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie,\nwhich no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.\nDashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted\nthe room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in the\ngreatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so\nwonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means of\nlessening but by their own conjectures.\n\n\n\n\nUnaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might\nappear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to\nwhat purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined\nby all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent\nengagement, contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already\ndone for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in\nthe failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another.\n\nHis errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.  It was only to ask\nElinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether\ninexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should\nfeel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in\nneed of encouragement and fresh air.\n\nHow soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how\nsoon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he\nexpressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly\ntold.  This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at\nfour o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his\nlady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous\nprofession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one\nof the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was more than commonly\njoyful.  He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to\nswell his heart, and raise his spirits.  He was released without any\nreproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his\nmisery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--and elevated at\nonce to that security with another, which he must have thought of\nalmost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with\ndesire.  He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to\nhappiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,\nflowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in\nhim before.\n\nHis heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors\nconfessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the\nphilosophic dignity of twenty-four.\n\n\"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,\" said he, \"the\nconsequence of ignorance of the world--and want of employment.  Had my\nmother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen\nfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure, it would never\nhave happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the\ntime, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had\nany pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\nfrom her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied\nattachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I\nmust have done.  But instead of having any thing to do, instead of\nhaving any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any\nmyself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first\ntwelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which\nbelonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered\nat Oxford till I was nineteen.  I had therefore nothing in the world to\ndo, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home\nin every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my\nbrother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to\nbe very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and\nwas always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything\nthat was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty too--at least I thought\nso THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no\ncomparisons, and see no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I\nhope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every\nway been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable\npiece of folly.\"\n\nThe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness\nof the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the\nsatisfaction of a sleepless night.  Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be\ncomfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how\nto be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,\nnor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation\ntogether, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.\n\nMarianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.  Comparisons would\noccur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love\nfor her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.\n\nBut Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of\nlearning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the\nmoment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she\nwas every thing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment had\npassed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared\nher situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably\nreleased from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the\nrelease, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as\nconstant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed, she was\novercome by her own felicity;--and happily disposed as is the human\nmind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it\nrequired several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree\nof tranquillity to her heart.\n\nEdward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever\nother claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a\nweek should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or\nsuffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and\nthe future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of\nincessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in\ncommon between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is\ndifferent.  Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is\neven made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.\n\nLucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,\nformed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and\nElinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in\nevery view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable\ncircumstances she had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,\nand by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of\nwhose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a\ngirl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that\nbrother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond her\ncomprehension to make out.  To her own heart it was a delightful\naffair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her\nreason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.\n\nEdward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,\nat first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked\non by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.\nElinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his\nopinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have\ndone, if applied to in time.  She repeated it to Edward.\n\n\"THAT was exactly like Robert,\"--was his immediate observation.--\"And\nTHAT,\" he presently added, \"might perhaps be in HIS head when the\nacquaintance between them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour.  Other designs\nmight afterward arise.\"\n\nHow long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally\nat a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had\nremained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means\nof hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last\nwere neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.  Not the\nsmallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for\nwhat followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy\nherself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between\nthe wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.  He put the\nletter into Elinor's hands.\n\n     \"DEAR SIR,\n\n     \"Being very sure I have long lost your affections,\n     I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own\n     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with\n     him as I once used to think I might be with you;\n     but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was\n     another's.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,\n     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always\n     good friends, as our near relationship now makes\n     proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,\n     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any\n     ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections\n     entirely, and as we could not live without one\n     another, we are just returned from the altar, and\n     are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which\n     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,\n     but thought I would first trouble you with these\n     few lines, and shall always remain,\n\n     \"Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,\n                                        \"LUCY FERRARS.\n\n     \"I have burnt all your letters, and will return\n     your picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy\n     my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very\n     welcome to keep.\"\n\nElinor read and returned it without any comment.\n\n\"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,\" said\nEdward.--\"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU\nin former days.--In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I\nhave blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say\nthat since the first half year of our foolish--business--this is the\nonly letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me\nany amends for the defect of the style.\"\n\n\"However it may have come about,\" said Elinor, after a pause,--\"they\nare certainly married.  And your mother has brought on herself a most\nappropriate punishment.  The independence she settled on Robert,\nthrough resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own\nchoice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\na-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for\nintending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's\nmarrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.\"\n\n\"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.--She\nwill be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him\nmuch sooner.\"\n\nIn what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew\nnot, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted\nby him.  He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after\nLucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest\nroad to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with\nwhich that road did not hold the most intimate connection.  He could do\nnothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his\nrapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the\njealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of\nthe modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness\nwith which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect\na very cruel reception.  It was his business, however, to say that he\nDID, and he said it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject a\ntwelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and\nwives.\n\nThat Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of\nmalice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to\nElinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her\ncharacter, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost\nmeanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,\neven before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a\nwant of liberality in some of her opinions--they had been equally\nimputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter\nreached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,\ngood-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.  Nothing but\nsuch a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an\nengagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his\nmother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to\nhim.\n\n\"I thought it my duty,\" said he, \"independent of my feelings, to give\nher the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was\nrenounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in\nthe world to assist me.  In such a situation as that, where there\nseemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living\ncreature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly\ninsisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but\nthe most disinterested affection was her inducement?  And even now, I\ncannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage\nit could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the\nsmallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.\nShe could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.\"\n\n\"No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;\nthat your own family might in time relent.  And at any rate, she lost\nnothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it\nfettered neither her inclination nor her actions.  The connection was\ncertainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration\namong her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would\nbe better for her to marry YOU than be single.\"\n\nEdward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have\nbeen more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than the\nmotive of it.\n\nElinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which\ncompliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at\nNorland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.\n\n\"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,\" said she; \"because--to say\nnothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to\nfancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be.\"\n\nHe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken\nconfidence in the force of his engagement.\n\n\"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to\nanother, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the\nconsciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred\nas my honour.  I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only\nfriendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and\nLucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that, I suppose, I WAS\nwrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I\nreconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than\nthese:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but\nmyself.\"\n\nElinor smiled, and shook her head.\n\nEdward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at the\nCottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him,\nbut to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\nhis giving him the living of Delaford--\"Which, at present,\" said he,\n\"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,\nhe must think I have never forgiven him for offering.\"\n\nNOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place.\nBut so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed all his\nknowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish,\ncondition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who\nhad heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much\nattention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.\n\nOne question after this only remained undecided, between them, one\ndifficulty only was to be overcome.  They were brought together by\nmutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness\ncertain--and they only wanted something to live upon.  Edward had two\nthousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all\nthat they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.\nDashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite\nenough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year\nwould supply them with the comforts of life.\n\nEdward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his\nmother towards him; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their\nincome.  But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would\nstill be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been\nspoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evil\nthan his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence would\nserve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.\n\nAbout four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to\ncomplete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of\nhaving, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company\nwith her than her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the\nprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every\nnight to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned\nin the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete\nbefore breakfast.\n\nA three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at\nleast, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between\nthirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind\nwhich needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness\nof her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother's language, to\nmake it cheerful.  Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he\ndid revive.  No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew\nnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were\nconsequently spent in hearing and in wondering.  Every thing was\nexplained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice\nin what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the\ninterest of Elinor.\n\nIt would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good\nopinion of each other, as they advanced in each other's acquaintance,\nfor it could not be otherwise.  Their resemblance in good principles\nand good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other\nattraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters\nfond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.\n\nThe letters from town, which a few days before would have made every\nnerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read\nwith less emotion than mirth.  Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the\nwonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting\ngirl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she\nwas sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all\naccounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.-- \"I do think,\" she\ncontinued, \"nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days\nbefore Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul\nsuspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!  came\ncrying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars,\nas well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems\nborrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we\nsuppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in\nthe world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her\ndown to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with\nMrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor\nagain.  And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them along\nwith them in the chaise is worse than all.  Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot\nget him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and Miss\nMarianne must try to comfort him.\"\n\nMr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.  Mrs. Ferrars was the most\nunfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of\nsensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such a\nblow, with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unpardonable, but\nLucy's was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were ever again to be\nmentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced\nto forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her\ndaughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy with\nwhich everything had been carried on between them, was rationally\ntreated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion\nof it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to\nprevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in\nregretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather been\nfulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery\nfarther in the family.-- He thus continued:\n\n\"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not\nsurprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been\nreceived from him on the occasion.  Perhaps, however, he is kept silent\nby his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a\nline to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper\nsubmission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to\nher mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of\nMrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be\non good terms with her children.\"\n\nThis paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of\nEdward.  It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not\nexactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.\n\n\"A letter of proper submission!\" repeated he; \"would they have me beg\nmy mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to HER, and breach of\nhonour to ME?--I can make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor\npenitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy; but that would not\ninterest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make.\"\n\n\"You may certainly ask to be forgiven,\" said Elinor, \"because you have\noffended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to\nprofess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew\non you your mother's anger.\"\n\nHe agreed that he might.\n\n\"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be\nconvenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent\nin HER eyes as the first.\"\n\nHe had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a\nletter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,\nas he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by\nword of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing\nto Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good\noffices in his favour.-- \"And if they really DO interest themselves,\"\nsaid Marianne, in her new character of candour, \"in bringing about a\nreconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely\nwithout merit.\"\n\nAfter a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days, the\ntwo gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to\nDelaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future\nhome, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements\nwere needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of\nnights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.\n\n\n\n\nAfter a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent\nand so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always\nseemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward\nwas admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.\n\nHer family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.  For many years of\nher life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward\na few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of\nRobert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the\nresuscitation of Edward, she had one again.\n\nIn spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not\nfeel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his\npresent engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he\nfeared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off\nas rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution therefore it was\nrevealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness.  Mrs.\nFerrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying\nMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss\nMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and\nenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter\nof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only\nthe daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when\nshe found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her\nrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she\njudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and\ntherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own\ndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she\nissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.\n\nWhat she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to\nbe considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now\nher only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest\nobjection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two\nhundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for\nthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had\nbeen given with Fanny.\n\nIt was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by\nEdward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.\n\nWith an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,\nthey had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the\nliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with\nan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making\nconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for their\ncompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments\nand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,\nas usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying\ntill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton\nchurch early in the autumn.\n\nThe first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the\nMansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the\nParsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could\nchuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings's\nprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for\nshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by\nMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really\nbelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact\nnothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,\nand rather better pasturage for their cows.\n\nThey were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations\nand friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was\nalmost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the\nexpense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.\n\n\"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,\" said John, as\nthey were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford\nHouse, \"THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one\nof the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I\nconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon\nbrother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in\nsuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not\nseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in\nDelaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly\nthe person to attract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisable\nfor you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel\nBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may\nhappen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of\nanybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off to\nadvantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her a\nchance--You understand me.\"--\n\nBut though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them\nwith the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by\nher real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,\nand the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many\nmonths had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had\nat first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of\nhis deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous\nattentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was\ngiven for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and\nre-established him completely in her favour.\n\nThe whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which\ncrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance\nof what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however\nits progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every\nadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and\nconscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately\nvisited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed\nto him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the\nengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\nof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle\nthe matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--for\nthough Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her\nin TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to\nproduce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind when\nthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's\ndiscourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, and\nthe rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came\ngradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always\nmore to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an\ninterest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily\nevident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was\nproud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of\nmarrying privately without his mother's consent.  What immediately\nfollowed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at\nDawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and\nhe drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence\nreturning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the\nsimple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was\nadopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,\ncomprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and\ntherefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks\nlonger unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and\nmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for\nthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\nnotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,\nby rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\nLucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;\nand while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended\nto marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,\nwas spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and\nalways openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in\ntown, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the\nbest terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the\njealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,\nin which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent\ndomestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing\ncould exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.\n\nWhat Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have\npuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to\nit, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,\nhowever, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing\never appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a\nsuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving\nhis brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward\nmight be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\nparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and\nfrom the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no\nless contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an\nexchange.\n\nElinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well\nbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,\nfor her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with\nher.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure\nin the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing\nMarianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though\nrather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her\ndarling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her\nvalued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was\nequally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and\ntheir own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the\nreward of all.\n\nWith such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of\nhis goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,\nwhich at last, though long after it was observable to everybody\nelse--burst on her--what could she do?\n\nMarianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born to\ndiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her\nconduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome an\naffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give\nher hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less\nthan herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years\nbefore, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought\nthe constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!\n\nBut so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible\npassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead\nof remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only\npleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and\nsober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen,\nsubmitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new\nhome, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.\n\nColonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,\nbelieved he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past\naffliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,\nand his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own\nhappiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of\neach observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and her\nwhole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had\nonce been to Willoughby.\n\nWilloughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his\npunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of\nMrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as\nthe source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he\nbehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy\nand rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its\nown punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long\nthought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But\nthat he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or\ncontracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must\nnot be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, and\nfrequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,\nnor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,\nand in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of\ndomestic felicity.\n\nFor Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving her\nloss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him in\nevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of\nperfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him\nin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.\n\nMrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without\nattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.\nJennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an\nage highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being\nsupposed to have a lover.\n\nBetween Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication\nwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the\nmerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked\nas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost\nwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreement\nbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":12229.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 46-50","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210123003206\/https:\/\/www.sparknotes.com\/lit\/sensibility\/section11\/","summary_text":"The Dashwoods return to Barton Cottage, and Marianne continues to recover from her illness.

Marianne feels much better knowing that his abandonment of her was not the final revelation of a long-standing deceit, but rather the result of his financial straits, and was thus not entirely willed.

Their reactions are ironic on two levels. First, Elinor was the sister with a close attachment to Edward, and thus, she has far more cause to break down in tears. Second, not only do the sisters' reactions seem reversed from what they should be, but the reactions of the men under discussion are reversed as well : it is actually Robert, not Edward, who is engaged to Lucy Steele. Several critics have objected to the implausibility of the match between Marianne and Colonel Brandon. Brandon is characterized as a clear-headed, dependable, practical man--the total opposite of the romantic and impetuous Marianne. Thus, Marianne's final acceptance of him seems completely out of character, since the marriage requires her to abandon her romantic ideals entirely. Moreover, Marianne and Colonel Brandon barely interact in the novel, especially in the concluding chapters. Thus, it seems unlikely that Marianne would come to love Brandon as she had loved Willoughby; she hardly knows him. Nonetheless, by closing the novel with their marriage, Austen shows the extent of Marianne's transformation: she writes, \"She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract by her conduct her most favourite maxims. \" If Marianne's ability to love Brandon is unconvincing, it is because of Austen's great faith in the ability of the individual to remake herself in light of shifting circumstances. The novel closes with a reminder that the most important attachment in the novel is not that between any man and woman, but between the two sisters. The sisters decide to live side-by-side together with their husbands at Delaford, thereby affirming the mutual respect and affection, which has kept them close throughout the entire novel. Ultimately, both sisters end up married to the novel's only second sons. Edward Ferrars, although strictly speaking the firstborn, is disinherited by his mother; as John Dashwood remarks, \"Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son. \" We know that Colonel Brandon is a second son because he has an older brother who married his old sweetheart, Eliza, many years before the novel's plot begins. Whereas these characters are the heroes of the novel, all the eldest sons, including John Dashwood, Robert Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon's older brother, are cast in a negative light. In Austen's day, the eldest sons were the ones who inherited all the family property according to the laws of male primogeniture. However, in spite of these inheritance laws, it is the second sons who ultimately find contentment in the novel; thus, they make happy lives for themselves despite societal and financial constraints.","summary_length":450.0,"analysis_length":466.0,"chap_int":50,"previous summary id":["chapter 49","chapter 49","chapter 49"],"previous chapter":["Edward came to Barton with the intent of proposing marriage to Elinor, now that he is free; Elinor accepts and he gains Mrs. Dashwood's consent to the match during the afternoon. Edward admits that any regard he had for Lucy was formed out of idleness and lack of knowledge of the world; but during the four years they were engaged, he soon came to regret the match, although he could not break with Lucy in good conscience. The entire family is unbelievably happy that Edward got an honorable release from his engagement, and that Elinor and Edward are to be wed; Elinor is absolutely overcome, since she had expected him to be lost forever to her. Edward also reveals that after leaving London, he received a letter from Lucy saying that she had married his brother Robert, and has not seen her since. After receiving the letter, he also set out for Barton immediately, now at liberty to do as he had wished. Colonel Brandon soon comes to visit, and they are all at Barton for some time; Edward will still accept the position at Delaford, although he and Elinor still will not have enough money to live on comfortably. Edward and the Colonel become good friends, since they are suited in sense and temperament; Edward goes to Delaford with the Colonel to see his new home, and then decides to go to town to attempt reconciliation with his family, and hope to regain financial support from them.","Apparently, Edward had come to Barton to ask Elinor to marry him. He left the house so abruptly to get some fresh air, gained confidence, then returned immediately to accomplish his mission. Three hours later, everything is settled, and everyone is immensely happy. Yay! Edward is happier than they've ever seen him , and he's genuinely cheerful and open to everyone, especially Elinor. He explains what happened with his engagement to Lucy - they'd fallen in love as teenagers, but as grownups, they'd grown apart. Part of the problem was that he hadn't had a clear path to employment once he left school, and no companions or friends - really, the only person he was close to as a youth was Lucy, so he had no basis for comparison. That night, everyone is so excited that nobody can sleep. It's a good kind of excitement, though - that of pure joy and relief. Marianne can only express her joy through crying, and has no words for her feelings. Elinor was so excited that even she lost her composure for a moment, before she pulled it together and was able to tell him how much she loves him - still, she's far from the normal calm Elinor we're used to. Edward stays at the cottage for a week, and he and Elinor spend the whole time enjoying each other's company and planning for the future. Lucy's marriage to Robert is a topic of much discussion as well - how did it happen? Everyone is mystified. Edward and Elinor discuss the possibility of plotting on Lucy's part; they decide that she probably began with the best intentions of gaining Robert's good favor for her marriage to Edward, but things changed somewhere along the line. Edward tells Elinor all about his breakup with Lucy. She'd written him a rather awkward letter, after she and Robert were already married, and requested that he destroy all her letters. He was horrified by the badness of her writing, but pleased by the content - everyone agrees that all's well that ends well. Mrs. Ferrars has even got her comeuppance, since the very daughter-in-law she hoped to eliminate by disowning Edward has cropped up again with Robert. Edward hasn't been in contact with his family since this all happened, and he's not sure what is going to happen. Elinor realizes that Lucy had meant to deceive the Dashwoods and hurt Elinor in particular by leading Thomas to believe that she had married Edward, not Robert. It's clear that Lucy is not actually a nice girl, but clearly something of an evil one. He wishes he'd known about it before his mother found out about everything - he would have broken up with Lucy had he known her real nature. He can't imagine why Lucy stuck with him for so long - why would she have stayed with him, even when he was disowned? Elinor figures that Lucy probably thought that she could gain from the association anyway, and that she'd assumed that in the end his family would give in. Elinor teases him for spending so much time at Norland with her when he was otherwise engaged with Lucy, but she doesn't mean it. He earnestly defends himself, saying that he thought he was safe from falling in love with Elinor if he was engaged already. Needless to say, he was wrong. Edward is glad that Colonel Brandon is coming to visit. He's excited to get to know his benefactor better; he used to resent Colonel Brandon because he though the Colonel was engaged to Elinor and he'd assumed that that's why he was offered the job at Delaford. Now that everything's cleared up, though, he's excited to make a new friend. As for money, Elinor has a thousand pounds of her own, and Edward has two thousand - combined with the Delaford living, that doesn't give them quite enough to live on. Edward hopes that his mother might change her mind toward him, but Elinor's not so sure. It seems to her that Robert's offensive marriage will just mean that Fanny will get more of the Ferrars fortune. A few days after Edward arrives, Colonel Brandon shows up. Mrs. Dashwood is overjoyed that everyone's together, but it means that they're out of room at the cottage, and Colonel Brandon has to stay at Barton Park. However, he comes to visit every day. He's been much revived by his three weeks at home, and is even more revived by Marianne's improvement in health. Mrs. Dashwood tells him all the surprising news about Lucy and Robert, and the Colonel is especially happy that he's helped Edward and Elinor out. Edward and Colonel Brandon become great friends quickly, not only because they're quite similar in personality, but also because they're in love with two sisters. Mrs. Jennings sends a letter from town relating the whole story of Lucy and Robert, which Elinor is now able to read with humor, not anxiety. John also writes, lamenting how unfortunate Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny are. Both Robert and Lucy are in her bad book, and even if she un-disowns Robert, she'll never forgive Lucy. Mrs. Ferrars hasn't said anything about Edward yet, but John thinks that Edward should write a conciliatory note to his mother - perhaps she will forgive him . Edward isn't sure what to do and doesn't want to write, as John suggests, a letter of \"submission,\" so Elinor counsels him to write a letter asking for forgiveness, perhaps with a little humility thrown in there for good measure. Colonel Brandon and Edward leave together to visit Delaford, after which Edward will go to London.","That very afternoon the couple became engaged. Edward explained to Elinor how he had happened to become engaged to Lucy Steele, and how \"it was not, at the time, an unnatural or inexcusable piece of folly.\" He then showed her the letter that he had received from Lucy informing him that she felt he didn't really love her and that she had found someone who could in Robert. Colonel Brandon came for a short time, and letters from Mrs. Jennings and John Dashwood brought news once again of Robert's marriage to Lucy. John felt that Edward should send a letter of apology to Mrs. Ferrars, but Edward decided to go to London in person to see his sister Fanny and \"personally intreat her good offices in his favour,\" hoping that she might be able to bring about a reconciliation with his mother."],"next summary id":"chapters 46-50","next chapter":"The Dashwoods return to Barton Cottage, and Marianne continues to recover from her illness.

However, it is discovered that in his house there are many dresses and jewelry purchased for Bathsheba and set aside for their eventual marriage. Many of the local townspeople argue that he should be found insane, and thus not criminally responsible. In March, the judges meet to determine whether or not the sentence should be commuted, and Boldwood is sentenced to life in prison. Bathsheba recovers very slowly from the traumatic events of Christmas. In August, she encounters Gabriel while she is visiting Troy's grave; she has had him buried in the same grave with Fanny. Gabriel surprises her by saying that he is planning to move to California in the spring, and she objects that she will be lost without his help at the farm. She becomes more and more distraught to think of losing him as the months pass, and in the winter, he gives her formal notice that he will be leaving before the end of March. That night she goes to his cottage and asks if he is leaving because she has offended him. He explains that he is not going to leave England, but he is going to be leasing Boldwood's farm beginning in March. He notes that this doesn't mean he couldn't still work for her at the same time, but he is uncomfortable since rumors have started that he hopes to marry her and thinks it would be better if he did not work for her anymore. Bathsheba's objections spark Gabriel's curiosity, and he admits that of course he still loves her. The two of them joyfully realize that they mutually love each other. A short time later, Bathsheba agrees to marry him, and the two marry in a small, private ceremony with only a few close friends present. Gabriel comes to live with her at the Everdene farm, and the novel ends with an optimistic view of a happy and loving marriage for them.\", \"analysis\": \"The traumatic and violent events of the Christmas party seem to soften many of the characters into a new acceptance of their fates. Boldwood meekly accepts the legal punishment, but evidence of his insanity allows for him to be granted the small mercy of imprisonment. The discovery of the items he has purchased and set aside for Bathsheba reveals his obsessive hope: given that she only confirmed their engagement the night of the party, he must have been purchasing these items well before he knew whether or not she would agree to marry him. The discovery also reveals his fixation on wealth and status: when he tried to envision how he could best please Bathsheba, Boldwood assumed jewels and fine clothes must be the key to her heart. With Boldwood and Troy both out of the picture, Bathsheba can finally live without the distraction of men trying to woo her. By this stage in the novel, however, it seems that some of her ambition and zest for life has been lost. She plays a less and less active role in managing the farm. Even when she learns that Gabriel plans to leave, she is not outraged and indignant so much as lost and afraid. She knows she depends on him both professionally and personally, and is afraid of what she will do without him. Bathsheba does show some of her drive towards bold action by going to Gabriel's cottage the night after he hands in his resignation. It would be considered quite improper for a woman to go alone to a man's home after dark, even though as a widow Bathsheba now has more freedom than she did as an unmarried woman. The two have always seemed to communicate honestly and freely, and Bathsheba seeks out that frankness by trying to determine why Gabriel feels compelled to leave. However, what becomes clear is that the two have actually misunderstood each other. Bathsheba took Gabriel's unwillingness to ask about her feelings as a sign that he no longer cared for her, while he assumed that her initial answer had been a final one. The establishment of a romantic relationship, and then the marriage between the two seems to signal that partnerships best arise out of mutual respect and getting to know one another over a long span of time while working towards shared goals. The marriage seems to show some promising signs of being egalitarian in that it is rooted in the partnership of running the farm, and Gabriel will be moving in to Bathsheba's house. At the same time, for the marriage to come about Bathsheba seems to need to have been tamed by her experience of loss and betrayal. She is no longer the proud and willful woman she was at the beginning of the novel, and it is only once she becomes more docile and more resigned to requiring the assistance of a man that she can accept a relationship with Gabriel. In the end, \\\"in allowing Oak the positions of both phallic male and castrated male, while awarding Bathsheba the contradictory position of powerful and dependent female, Hardy denies power and sexuality to neither sex\\\" .\"}","chapter":"AFTER THE SHOCK\n\n\nBoldwood passed into the high road and turned in the direction of\nCasterbridge.  Here he walked at an even, steady pace over Yalbury\nHill, along the dead level beyond, mounted Mellstock Hill, and\nbetween eleven and twelve o'clock crossed the Moor into the town.\nThe streets were nearly deserted now, and the waving lamp-flames only\nlighted up rows of grey shop-shutters, and strips of white paving\nupon which his step echoed as his passed along.  He turned to the\nright, and halted before an archway of heavy stonework, which was\nclosed by an iron studded pair of doors.  This was the entrance\nto the gaol, and over it a lamp was fixed, the light enabling the\nwretched traveller to find a bell-pull.\n\nThe small wicket at last opened, and a porter appeared.  Boldwood\nstepped forward, and said something in a low tone, when, after a\ndelay, another man came.  Boldwood entered, and the door was closed\nbehind him, and he walked the world no more.\n\nLong before this time Weatherbury had been thoroughly aroused, and\nthe wild deed which had terminated Boldwood's merrymaking became\nknown to all.  Of those out of the house Oak was one of the first to\nhear of the catastrophe, and when he entered the room, which was\nabout five minutes after Boldwood's exit, the scene was terrible.\nAll the female guests were huddled aghast against the walls like\nsheep in a storm, and the men were bewildered as to what to do.  As\nfor Bathsheba, she had changed.  She was sitting on the floor beside\nthe body of Troy, his head pillowed in her lap, where she had herself\nlifted it.  With one hand she held her handkerchief to his breast and\ncovered the wound, though scarcely a single drop of blood had flowed,\nand with the other she tightly clasped one of his.  The household\nconvulsion had made her herself again.  The temporary coma had\nceased, and activity had come with the necessity for it.  Deeds of\nendurance, which seem ordinary in philosophy, are rare in conduct,\nand Bathsheba was astonishing all around her now, for her philosophy\nwas her conduct, and she seldom thought practicable what she did\nnot practise.  She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers\nare made.  She was indispensable to high generation, hated at tea\nparties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.  Troy recumbent in\nhis wife's lap formed now the sole spectacle in the middle of the\nspacious room.\n\n\"Gabriel,\" she said, automatically, when he entered, turning up a\nface of which only the well-known lines remained to tell him it\nwas hers, all else in the picture having faded quite.  \"Ride to\nCasterbridge instantly for a surgeon.  It is, I believe, useless,\nbut go.  Mr. Boldwood has shot my husband.\"\n\nHer statement of the fact in such quiet and simple words came with\nmore force than a tragic declamation, and had somewhat the effect of\nsetting the distorted images in each mind present into proper focus.\nOak, almost before he had comprehended anything beyond the briefest\nabstract of the event, hurried out of the room, saddled a horse and\nrode away.  Not till he had ridden more than a mile did it occur to\nhim that he would have done better by sending some other man on this\nerrand, remaining himself in the house.  What had become of Boldwood?\nHe should have been looked after.  Was he mad--had there been a\nquarrel?  Then how had Troy got there?  Where had he come from?  How\ndid this remarkable reappearance effect itself when he was supposed\nby many to be at the bottom of the sea?  Oak had in some slight\nmeasure been prepared for the presence of Troy by hearing a rumour\nof his return just before entering Boldwood's house; but before he\nhad weighed that information, this fatal event had been superimposed.\nHowever, it was too late now to think of sending another messenger,\nand he rode on, in the excitement of these self-inquiries\nnot discerning, when about three miles from Casterbridge, a\nsquare-figured pedestrian passing along under the dark hedge in the\nsame direction as his own.\n\nThe miles necessary to be traversed, and other hindrances incidental\nto the lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night, delayed\nthe arrival of Mr. Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours\npassed between the time at which the shot was fired and that of his\nentering the house.  Oak was additionally detained in Casterbridge\nthrough having to give notice to the authorities of what had\nhappened; and he then found that Boldwood had also entered the town,\nand delivered himself up.\n\nIn the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into the hall at\nBoldwood's, found it in darkness and quite deserted.  He went on to\nthe back of the house, where he discovered in the kitchen an old man,\nof whom he made inquiries.\n\n\"She's had him took away to her own house, sir,\" said his informant.\n\n\"Who has?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Mrs. Troy.  'A was quite dead, sir.\"\n\nThis was astonishing information.  \"She had no right to do that,\"\nsaid the doctor.  \"There will have to be an inquest, and she should\nhave waited to know what to do.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; it was hinted to her that she had better wait till the law\nwas known.  But she said law was nothing to her, and she wouldn't let\nher dear husband's corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for\nall the crowners in England.\"\n\nMr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the hill to Bathsheba's.\nThe first person he met was poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have\ndwindled smaller in these few latter hours.  \"What has been done?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" said Liddy, with suspended breath.  \"My mistress\nhas done it all.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Upstairs with him, sir.  When he was brought home and taken\nupstairs, she said she wanted no further help from the men.  And then\nshe called me, and made me fill the bath, and after that told me I\nhad better go and lie down because I looked so ill.  Then she locked\nherself into the room alone with him, and would not let a nurse come\nin, or anybody at all.  But I thought I'd wait in the next room in\ncase she should want me.  I heard her moving about inside for more\nthan an hour, but she only came out once, and that was for more\ncandles, because hers had burnt down into the socket.  She said we\nwere to let her know when you or Mr. Thirdly came, sir.\"\n\nOak entered with the parson at this moment, and they all went\nupstairs together, preceded by Liddy Smallbury.  Everything was\nsilent as the grave when they paused on the landing.  Liddy knocked,\nand Bathsheba's dress was heard rustling across the room: the key\nturned in the lock, and she opened the door.  Her looks were calm and\nnearly rigid, like a slightly animated bust of Melpomene.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last,\" she murmured from her lips\nmerely, and threw back the door.  \"Ah, and Mr. Thirdly.  Well, all is\ndone, and anybody in the world may see him now.\"  She then passed by\nhim, crossed the landing, and entered another room.\n\nLooking into the chamber of death she had vacated they saw by the\nlight of the candles which were on the drawers a tall straight\nshape lying at the further end of the bedroom, wrapped in white.\nEverything around was quite orderly.  The doctor went in, and after a\nfew minutes returned to the landing again, where Oak and the parson\nstill waited.\n\n\"It is all done, indeed, as she says,\" remarked Mr. Aldritch, in a\nsubdued voice.  \"The body has been undressed and properly laid out in\ngrave clothes.  Gracious Heaven--this mere girl!  She must have the\nnerve of a stoic!\"\n\n\"The heart of a wife merely,\" floated in a whisper about the ears\nof the three, and turning they saw Bathsheba in the midst of them.\nThen, as if at that instant to prove that her fortitude had been\nmore of will than of spontaneity, she silently sank down between\nthem and was a shapeless heap of drapery on the floor.  The simple\nconsciousness that superhuman strain was no longer required had at\nonce put a period to her power to continue it.\n\nThey took her away into a further room, and the medical attendance\nwhich had been useless in Troy's case was invaluable in Bathsheba's,\nwho fell into a series of fainting-fits that had a serious aspect\nfor a time.  The sufferer was got to bed, and Oak, finding from the\nbulletins that nothing really dreadful was to be apprehended on her\nscore, left the house.  Liddy kept watch in Bathsheba's chamber,\nwhere she heard her mistress, moaning in whispers through the dull\nslow hours of that wretched night: \"Oh it is my fault--how can I\nlive!  O Heaven, how can I live!\"\n\n\n\nTHE MARCH FOLLOWING--\"BATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD\"\n\n\nWe pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a breezy day without\nsunshine, frost, or dew.  On Yalbury Hill, about midway between\nWeatherbury and Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over\nthe crest, a numerous concourse of people had gathered, the eyes of\nthe greater number being frequently stretched afar in a northerly\ndirection.  The groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of\njavelin-men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst were carriages, one\nof which contained the high sheriff.  With the idlers, many of whom\nhad mounted to the top of a cutting formed for the road, were several\nWeatherbury men and boys--among others Poorgrass, Coggan, and Cain\nBall.\n\nAt the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in the expected\nquarter, and shortly after a travelling-carriage, bringing one of the\ntwo judges on the Western Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the\ntop.  The judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the\nbig-cheeked trumpeters, and a procession being formed of the vehicles\nand javelin-men, they all proceeded towards the town, excepting the\nWeatherbury men, who as soon as they had seen the judge move off\nreturned home again to their work.\n\n\"Joseph, I seed you squeezing close to the carriage,\" said Coggan, as\nthey walked.  \"Did ye notice my lord judge's face?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Poorgrass.  \"I looked hard at en, as if I would read\nhis very soul; and there was mercy in his eyes--or to speak with the\nexact truth required of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was\ntowards me.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope for the best,\" said Coggan, \"though bad that must be.\nHowever, I shan't go to the trial, and I'd advise the rest of ye\nthat bain't wanted to bide away.  'Twill disturb his mind more than\nanything to see us there staring at him as if he were a show.\"\n\n\"The very thing I said this morning,\" observed Joseph, \"'Justice is\ncome to weigh him in the balances,' I said in my reflectious way,\n'and if he's found wanting, so be it unto him,' and a bystander said\n'Hear, hear!  A man who can talk like that ought to be heard.' But I\ndon't like dwelling upon it, for my few words are my few words, and\nnot much; though the speech of some men is rumoured abroad as though\nby nature formed for such.\"\n\n\"So 'tis, Joseph.  And now, neighbours, as I said, every man bide at\nhome.\"\n\nThe resolution was adhered to; and all waited anxiously for the news\nnext day.  Their suspense was diverted, however, by a discovery which\nwas made in the afternoon, throwing more light on Boldwood's conduct\nand condition than any details which had preceded it.\n\nThat he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair until the fatal\nChristmas Eve in excited and unusual moods was known to those who had\nbeen intimate with him; but nobody imagined that there had shown in\nhim unequivocal symptoms of the mental derangement which Bathsheba\nand Oak, alone of all others and at different times, had momentarily\nsuspected.  In a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary\ncollection of articles.  There were several sets of ladies' dresses\nin the piece, of sundry expensive materials; silks and satins,\npoplins and velvets, all of colours which from Bathsheba's style of\ndress might have been judged to be her favourites.  There were two\nmuffs, sable and ermine.  Above all there was a case of jewellery,\ncontaining four heavy gold bracelets and several lockets and rings,\nall of fine quality and manufacture.  These things had been bought in\nBath and other towns from time to time, and brought home by stealth.\nThey were all carefully packed in paper, and each package was\nlabelled \"Bathsheba Boldwood,\" a date being subjoined six years in\nadvance in every instance.\n\nThese somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love\nwere the subject of discourse in Warren's malt-house when Oak entered\nfrom Casterbridge with tidings of sentence. He came in the afternoon,\nand his face, as the kiln glow shone upon it, told the tale\nsufficiently well.  Boldwood, as every one supposed he would do, had\npleaded guilty, and had been sentenced to death.\n\nThe conviction that Boldwood had not been morally responsible for his\nlater acts now became general.  Facts elicited previous to the trial\nhad pointed strongly in the same direction, but they had not been of\nsufficient weight to lead to an order for an examination into the\nstate of Boldwood's mind.  It was astonishing, now that a presumption\nof insanity was raised, how many collateral circumstances were\nremembered to which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford\nthe only explanation--among others, the unprecedented neglect of his\ncorn stacks in the previous summer.\n\nA petition was addressed to the Home Secretary, advancing\nthe circumstances which appeared to justify a request for a\nreconsideration of the sentence.  It was not \"numerously signed\"\nby the inhabitants of Casterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for\nBoldwood had never made many friends over the counter.  The shops\nthought it very natural that a man who, by importing direct from\nthe producer, had daringly set aside the first great principle of\nprovincial existence, namely that God made country villages to supply\ncustomers to county towns, should have confused ideas about the\nDecalogue.  The prompters were a few merciful men who had perhaps too\nfeelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed, and the result was\nthat evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in\na moral point of view, out of the category of wilful murder, and lead\nit to be regarded as a sheer outcome of madness.\n\nThe upshot of the petition was waited for in Weatherbury with\nsolicitous interest.  The execution had been fixed for eight o'clock\non a Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was\npassed, and up to Friday afternoon no answer had been received.  At\nthat time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither he had been\nto wish Boldwood good-bye, and turned down a by-street to avoid the\ntown.  When past the last house he heard a hammering, and lifting\nhis bowed head he looked back for a moment.  Over the chimneys he\ncould see the upper part of the gaol entrance, rich and glowing\nin the afternoon sun, and some moving figures were there.  They\nwere carpenters lifting a post into a vertical position within the\nparapet.  He withdrew his eyes quickly, and hastened on.\n\nIt was dark when he reached home, and half the village was out to\nmeet him.\n\n\"No tidings,\" Gabriel said, wearily.  \"And I'm afraid there's no\nhope.  I've been with him more than two hours.\"\n\n\"Do ye think he REALLY was out of his mind when he did it?\" said\nSmallbury.\n\n\"I can't honestly say that I do,\" Oak replied.  \"However, that we can\ntalk of another time.  Has there been any change in mistress this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"Is she downstairs?\"\n\n\"No.  And getting on so nicely as she was too.  She's but very little\nbetter now again than she was at Christmas.  She keeps on asking\nif you be come, and if there's news, till one's wearied out wi'\nanswering her.  Shall I go and say you've come?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Oak.  \"There's a chance yet; but I couldn't stay in town\nany longer--after seeing him too.  So Laban--Laban is here, isn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tall.\n\n\"What I've arranged is, that you shall ride to town the last thing\nto-night; leave here about nine, and wait a while there, getting home\nabout twelve.  If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, they\nsay there's no chance at all.\"\n\n\"I do so hope his life will be spared,\" said Liddy.  \"If it is not,\nshe'll go out of her mind too.  Poor thing; her sufferings have been\ndreadful; she deserves anybody's pity.\"\n\n\"Is she altered much?\" said Coggan.\n\n\"If you haven't seen poor mistress since Christmas, you wouldn't know\nher,\" said Liddy.  \"Her eyes are so miserable that she's not the same\nwoman.  Only two years ago she was a romping girl, and now she's\nthis!\"\n\nLaban departed as directed, and at eleven o'clock that night several\nof the villagers strolled along the road to Casterbridge and awaited\nhis arrival--among them Oak, and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba's\nmen.  Gabriel's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved, even\nthough in his conscience he felt that he ought to die; for there had\nbeen qualities in the farmer which Oak loved.  At last, when they all\nwere weary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance--\n\n\n     First dead, as if on turf it trode,\n     Then, clattering on the village road\n     In other pace than forth he yode.\n\n\n\"We shall soon know now, one way or other.\" said Coggan, and they all\nstepped down from the bank on which they had been standing into the\nroad, and the rider pranced into the midst of them.\n\n\"Is that you, Laban?\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Yes--'tis come.  He's not to die.  'Tis confinement during Her\nMajesty's pleasure.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" said Coggan, with a swelling heart.  \"God's above the devil\nyet!\"\n\n\n\nBEAUTY IN LONELINESS--AFTER ALL\n\n\nBathsheba revived with the spring.  The utter prostration that\nhad followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished\nperceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to\nan end.\n\nBut she remained alone now for the greater part of her time, and\nstayed in the house, or at furthest went into the garden.  She\nshunned every one, even Liddy, and could be brought to make no\nconfidences, and to ask for no sympathy.\n\nAs the summer drew on she passed more of her time in the open air,\nand began to examine into farming matters from sheer necessity,\nthough she never rode out or personally superintended as at former\ntimes.  One Friday evening in August she walked a little way along\nthe road and entered the village for the first time since the sombre\nevent of the preceding Christmas.  None of the old colour had as yet\ncome to her cheek, and its absolute paleness was heightened by the\njet black of her gown, till it appeared preternatural.  When she\nreached a little shop at the other end of the place, which stood\nnearly opposite to the churchyard, Bathsheba heard singing inside the\nchurch, and she knew that the singers were practising.  She crossed\nthe road, opened the gate, and entered the graveyard, the high sills\nof the church windows effectually screening her from the eyes of\nthose gathered within.  Her stealthy walk was to the nook wherein\nTroy had worked at planting flowers upon Fanny Robin's grave, and\nshe came to the marble tombstone.\n\nA motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she read the complete\ninscription.  First came the words of Troy himself:--\n\n\n     ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY\n      IN BELOVED MEMORY OF\n          FANNY ROBIN,\n    WHO DIED OCTOBER 9, 18--,\n          AGED 20 YEARS\n\n\nUnderneath this was now inscribed in new letters:--\n\n\n      IN THE SAME GRAVE LIE\n   THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID\n          FRANCIS TROY,\n   WHO DIED DECEMBER 24TH, 18--,\n          AGED 26 YEARS\n\n\nWhilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of the organ\nbegan again in the church, and she went with the same light step\nround to the porch and listened.  The door was closed, and the\nchoir was learning a new hymn.  Bathsheba was stirred by emotions\nwhich latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within her.\nThe little attenuated voices of the children brought to her ear\nin distinct utterance the words they sang without thought or\ncomprehension--\n\n\n     Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\n       Lead Thou me on.\n\n\nBathsheba's feeling was always to some extent dependent upon her\nwhim, as is the case with many other women.  Something big came into\nher throat and an uprising to her eyes--and she thought that she\nwould allow the imminent tears to flow if they wished.  They did\nflow and plenteously, and one fell upon the stone bench beside her.\nOnce that she had begun to cry for she hardly knew what, she could\nnot leave off for crowding thoughts she knew too well.  She would\nhave given anything in the world to be, as those children were,\nunconcerned at the meaning of their words, because too innocent to\nfeel the necessity for any such expression.  All the impassioned\nscenes of her brief experience seemed to revive with added emotion at\nthat moment, and those scenes which had been without emotion during\nenactment had emotion then.  Yet grief came to her rather as a luxury\nthan as the scourge of former times.\n\nOwing to Bathsheba's face being buried in her hands she did not\nnotice a form which came quietly into the porch, and on seeing\nher, first moved as if to retreat, then paused and regarded her.\nBathsheba did not raise her head for some time, and when she looked\nround her face was wet, and her eyes drowned and dim.  \"Mr. Oak,\"\nexclaimed she, disconcerted, \"how long have you been here?\"\n\n\"A few minutes, ma'am,\" said Oak, respectfully.\n\n\"Are you going in?\" said Bathsheba; and there came from within the\nchurch as from a prompter--\n\n\n     I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,\n     Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.\n\n\n\"I was,\" said Gabriel.  \"I am one of the bass singers, you know.  I\nhave sung bass for several months.\"\n\n\"Indeed: I wasn't aware of that.  I'll leave you, then.\"\n\n\n     Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile,\n\n\nsang the children.\n\n\"Don't let me drive you away, mistress.  I think I won't go in\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Oh no--you don't drive me away.\"\n\nThen they stood in a state of some embarrassment, Bathsheba trying to\nwipe her dreadfully drenched and inflamed face without his noticing\nher.  At length Oak said, \"I've not seen you--I mean spoken to\nyou--since ever so long, have I?\"  But he feared to bring distressing\nmemories back, and interrupted himself with: \"Were you going into\nchurch?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.  \"I came to see the tombstone privately--to see if\nthey had cut the inscription as I wished.  Mr. Oak, you needn't mind\nspeaking to me, if you wish to, on the matter which is in both our\nminds at this moment.\"\n\n\"And have they done it as you wished?\" said Oak.\n\n\"Yes.  Come and see it, if you have not already.\"\n\nSo together they went and read the tomb.  \"Eight months ago!\" Gabriel\nmurmured when he saw the date.  \"It seems like yesterday to me.\"\n\n\"And to me as if it were years ago--long years, and I had been dead\nbetween.  And now I am going home, Mr. Oak.\"\n\nOak walked after her.  \"I wanted to name a small matter to you as\nsoon as I could,\" he said, with hesitation.  \"Merely about business,\nand I think I may just mention it now, if you'll allow me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"It is that I may soon have to give up the management of your farm,\nMrs. Troy.  The fact is, I am thinking of leaving England--not yet,\nyou know--next spring.\"\n\n\"Leaving England!\" she said, in surprise and genuine disappointment.\n\"Why, Gabriel, what are you going to do that for?\"\n\n\"Well, I've thought it best,\" Oak stammered out.  \"California is the\nspot I've had in my mind to try.\"\n\n\"But it is understood everywhere that you are going to take poor Mr.\nBoldwood's farm on your own account.\"\n\n\"I've had the refusal o' it 'tis true; but nothing is settled yet,\nand I have reasons for giving up.  I shall finish out my year there\nas manager for the trustees, but no more.\"\n\n\"And what shall I do without you?  Oh, Gabriel, I don't think you\nought to go away.  You've been with me so long--through bright times\nand dark times--such old friends as we are--that it seems unkind\nalmost.  I had fancied that if you leased the other farm as master,\nyou might still give a helping look across at mine.  And now going\naway!\"\n\n\"I would have willingly.\"\n\n\"Yet now that I am more helpless than ever you go away!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the ill fortune o' it,\" said Gabriel, in a distressed\ntone.  \"And it is because of that very helplessness that I feel bound\nto go.  Good afternoon, ma'am\" he concluded, in evident anxiety to\nget away, and at once went out of the churchyard by a path she could\nfollow on no pretence whatever.\n\nBathsheba went home, her mind occupied with a new trouble, which\nbeing rather harassing than deadly was calculated to do good by\ndiverting her from the chronic gloom of her life.  She was set\nthinking a great deal about Oak and of his wish to shun her;\nand there occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of her latter\nintercourse with him, which, trivial when singly viewed, amounted\ntogether to a perceptible disinclination for her society.  It broke\nupon her at length as a great pain that her last old disciple was\nabout to forsake her and flee.  He who had believed in her and argued\non her side when all the rest of the world was against her, had at\nlast like the others become weary and neglectful of the old cause,\nand was leaving her to fight her battles alone.\n\nThree weeks went on, and more evidence of his want of interest in\nher was forthcoming.  She noticed that instead of entering the small\nparlour or office where the farm accounts were kept, and waiting, or\nleaving a memorandum as he had hitherto done during her seclusion,\nOak never came at all when she was likely to be there, only entering\nat unseasonable hours when her presence in that part of the house\nwas least to be expected.  Whenever he wanted directions he sent a\nmessage, or note with neither heading nor signature, to which she was\nobliged to reply in the same offhand style.  Poor Bathsheba began to\nsuffer now from the most torturing sting of all--a sensation that she\nwas despised.\n\nThe autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy\nconjectures, and Christmas-day came, completing a year of her legal\nwidowhood, and two years and a quarter of her life alone.  On\nexamining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the\nsubject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive--the\nevent in the hall at Boldwood's--was not agitating her at all; but\ninstead, an agonizing conviction that everybody abjured her--for what\nshe could not tell--and that Oak was the ringleader of the recusants.\nComing out of church that day she looked round in hope that Oak,\nwhose bass voice she had heard rolling out from the gallery overhead\nin a most unconcerned manner, might chance to linger in her path in\nthe old way.  There he was, as usual, coming down the path behind\nher.  But on seeing Bathsheba turn, he looked aside, and as soon\nas he got beyond the gate, and there was the barest excuse for a\ndivergence, he made one, and vanished.\n\nThe next morning brought the culminating stroke; she had been\nexpecting it long.  It was a formal notice by letter from him that he\nshould not renew his engagement with her for the following Lady-day.\n\nBathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most bitterly.  She\nwas aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from\nGabriel, which she had grown to regard as her inalienable right for\nlife, should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this\nway.  She was bewildered too by the prospect of having to rely on her\nown resources again: it seemed to herself that she never could again\nacquire energy sufficient to go to market, barter, and sell.\nSince Troy's death Oak had attended all sales and fairs for her,\ntransacting her business at the same time with his own.  What should\nshe do now?  Her life was becoming a desolation.\n\nSo desolate was Bathsheba this evening, that in an absolute hunger\nfor pity and sympathy, and miserable in that she appeared to have\noutlived the only true friendship she had ever owned, she put on her\nbonnet and cloak and went down to Oak's house just after sunset,\nguided on her way by the pale primrose rays of a crescent moon a few\ndays old.\n\nA lively firelight shone from the window, but nobody was visible in\nthe room.  She tapped nervously, and then thought it doubtful if\nit were right for a single woman to call upon a bachelor who lived\nalone, although he was her manager, and she might be supposed to call\non business without any real impropriety.  Gabriel opened the door,\nand the moon shone upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mr. Oak,\" said Bathsheba, faintly.\n\n\"Yes; I am Mr. Oak,\" said Gabriel.  \"Who have I the honour--O how\nstupid of me, not to know you, mistress!\"\n\n\"I shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I Gabriel?\" she\nsaid, in pathetic tones.\n\n\"Well, no.  I suppose--But come in, ma'am.  Oh--and I'll get a\nlight,\" Oak replied, with some awkwardness.\n\n\"No; not on my account.\"\n\n\"It is so seldom that I get a lady visitor that I'm afraid I haven't\nproper accommodation.  Will you sit down, please? Here's a chair, and\nthere's one, too.  I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and\nare rather hard, but I--was thinking of getting some new ones.\"  Oak\nplaced two or three for her.\n\n\"They are quite easy enough for me.\"\n\nSo down she sat, and down sat he, the fire dancing in their faces,\nand upon the old furniture,\n\n\n            all a-sheenen\n     Wi' long years o' handlen, [3]\n\n   [Footnote 3: W. Barnes]\n\nthat formed Oak's array of household possessions, which sent back a\ndancing reflection in reply.  It was very odd to these two persons,\nwho knew each other passing well, that the mere circumstance of their\nmeeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward\nand constrained.  In the fields, or at her house, there had never\nbeen any embarrassment; but now that Oak had become the entertainer\ntheir lives seemed to be moved back again to the days when they were\nstrangers.\n\n\"You'll think it strange that I have come, but--\"\n\n\"Oh no; not at all.\"\n\n\"But I thought--Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the belief that I\nhave offended you, and that you are going away on that account.  It\ngrieved me very much and I couldn't help coming.\"\n\n\"Offended me!  As if you could do that, Bathsheba!\"\n\n\"Haven't I?\" she asked, gladly.  \"But, what are you going away for\nelse?\"\n\n\"I am not going to emigrate, you know; I wasn't aware that you would\nwish me not to when I told 'ee or I shouldn't ha' thought of doing\nit,\" he said, simply.  \"I have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm\nand shall have it in my own hands at Lady-day.  You know I've had a\nshare in it for some time.  Still, that wouldn't prevent my attending\nto your business as before, hadn't it been that things have been said\nabout us.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Bathsheba, in surprise.  \"Things said about you and me!\nWhat are they?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"It would be wiser if you were to, I think.  You have played the part\nof mentor to me many times, and I don't see why you should fear to do\nit now.\"\n\n\"It is nothing that you have done, this time.  The top and tail\no't is this--that I am sniffing about here, and waiting for poor\nBoldwood's farm, with a thought of getting you some day.\"\n\n\"Getting me!  What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Marrying of 'ee, in plain British.  You asked me to tell, so you\nmustn't blame me.\"\n\nBathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been\ndischarged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected.  \"Marrying\nme!  I didn't know it was that you meant,\" she said, quietly.  \"Such\na thing as that is too absurd--too soon--to think of, by far!\"\n\n\"Yes; of course, it is too absurd.  I don't desire any such thing;\nI should think that was plain enough by this time.  Surely, surely\nyou be the last person in the world I think of marrying.  It is too\nabsurd, as you say.\"\n\n\"'Too--s-s-soon' were the words I used.\"\n\n\"I must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you said, 'too\nabsurd,' and so do I.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon too!\" she returned, with tears in her eyes.  \"'Too\nsoon' was what I said.  But it doesn't matter a bit--not at all--but\nI only meant, 'too soon.'  Indeed, I didn't, Mr. Oak, and you must\nbelieve me!\"\n\nGabriel looked her long in the face, but the firelight being faint\nthere was not much to be seen.  \"Bathsheba,\" he said, tenderly and in\nsurprise, and coming closer: \"if I only knew one thing--whether you\nwould allow me to love you and win you, and marry you after all--if\nI only knew that!\"\n\n\"But you never will know,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you never ask.\"\n\n\"Oh--Oh!\" said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyousness.  \"My own\ndear--\"\n\n\"You ought not to have sent me that harsh letter this morning,\" she\ninterrupted.  \"It shows you didn't care a bit about me, and were\nready to desert me like all the rest of them!  It was very cruel of\nyou, considering I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and\nyou were the first I ever had; and I shall not forget it!\"\n\n\"Now, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking,\" he said, laughing.\n\"You know it was purely that I, as an unmarried man, carrying on a\nbusiness for you as a very taking young woman, had a proper hard part\nto play--more particular that people knew I had a sort of feeling for\n'ee; and I fancied, from the way we were mentioned together, that it\nmight injure your good name.  Nobody knows the heat and fret I have\nbeen caused by it.\"\n\n\"And was that all?\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"Oh, how glad I am I came!\" she exclaimed, thankfully, as she rose\nfrom her seat.  \"I have thought so much more of you since I fancied\nyou did not want even to see me again.  But I must be going now, or\nI shall be missed.  Why Gabriel,\" she said, with a slight laugh, as\nthey went to the door, \"it seems exactly as if I had come courting\nyou--how dreadful!\"\n\n\"And quite right too,\" said Oak.  \"I've danced at your skittish\nheels, my beautiful Bathsheba, for many a long mile, and many a long\nday; and it is hard to begrudge me this one visit.\"\n\nHe accompanied her up the hill, explaining to her the details of\nhis forthcoming tenure of the other farm.  They spoke very little\nof their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being\nprobably unnecessary between such tried friends.  Theirs was that\nsubstantial affection which arises (if any arises at all) when the\ntwo who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher\nsides of each other's character, and not the best till further on,\nthe romance growing up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic\nreality.  This good-fellowship--_camaraderie_--usually occurring\nthrough similarity of pursuits, is unfortunately seldom superadded\nto love between the sexes, because men and women associate, not in\ntheir labours, but in their pleasures merely.  Where, however, happy\ncircumstance permits its development, the compounded feeling proves\nitself to be the only love which is strong as death--that love which\nmany waters cannot quench, nor the floods drown, beside which the\npassion usually called by the name is evanescent as steam.\n\n\n\nA FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING--CONCLUSION\n\n\n\"The most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to\nhave.\"\n\nThose had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one evening, some time after\nthe event of the preceding f, and he meditated a full hour by\nthe clock upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter.\n\n\"A license--O yes, it must be a license,\" he said to himself at last.\n\"Very well, then; first, a license.\"\n\nOn a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious steps\nfrom the surrogate's door, in Casterbridge.  On the way home he heard\na heavy tread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to\nbe Coggan.  They walked together into the village until they came to\na little lane behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban\nTall, who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was\nyet in mortal terror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone\nvoice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured\nto follow him.\n\n\"Well, good-night, Coggan,\" said Oak, \"I'm going down this way.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Coggan, surprised; \"what's going on to-night then, make so\nbold Mr. Oak?\"\n\nIt seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the\ncircumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time\nof Gabriel's unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, \"You can\nkeep a secret, Coggan?\"\n\n\"You've proved me, and you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, and I do know.  Well, then, mistress and I mean to get\nmarried to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Heaven's high tower!  And yet I've thought of such a thing from time\nto time; true, I have.  But keeping it so close!  Well, there, 'tis\nno consarn of of mine, and I wish 'ee joy o' her.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Coggan.  But I assure 'ee that this great hush is not\nwhat I wished for at all, or what either of us would have wished if\nit hadn't been for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem\nhardly the thing.  Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish\nshall not be in church, looking at her--she's shy-like and nervous\nabout it, in fact--so I be doing this to humour her.\"\n\n\"Ay, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say.  And you be now\ngoing down to the clerk.\"\n\n\"Yes; you may as well come with me.\"\n\n\"I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,\"\nsaid Coggan, as they walked along.  \"Labe Tall's old woman will horn\nit all over parish in half-an-hour.\"\n\n\"So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,\" said Oak,\npausing.  \"Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he's working\nso far off, and leaves early.\"\n\n\"I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her,\" said Coggan.  \"I'll knock\nand ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the\nbackground.  Then he'll come out, and you can tell yer tale.  She'll\nnever guess what I want en for; and I'll make up a few words about\nthe farm-work, as a blind.\"\n\nThis scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and\nrapped at Mrs. Tall's door.  Mrs. Tall herself opened it.\n\n\"I wanted to have a word with Laban.\"\n\n\"He's not at home, and won't be this side of eleven o'clock.  He've\nbeen forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work.  I shall\ndo quite as well.\"\n\n\"I hardly think you will.  Stop a moment;\" and Coggan stepped round\nthe corner of the porch to consult Oak.\n\n\"Who's t'other man, then?\" said Mrs. Tall.\n\n\"Only a friend,\" said Coggan.\n\n\"Say he's wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch to-morrow morning\nat ten,\" said Oak, in a whisper.  \"That he must come without fail,\nand wear his best clothes.\"\n\n\"The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!\" said Coggan.\n\n\"It can't be helped,\" said Oak.  \"Tell her.\"\n\nSo Coggan delivered the message.  \"Mind, het or wet, blow or snow,\nhe must come,\" added Jan.  \"'Tis very particular, indeed.  The fact\nis, 'tis to witness her sign some law-work about taking shares wi'\nanother farmer for a long span o' years.  There, that's what 'tis,\nand now I've told 'ee, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn't ha' done\nif I hadn't loved 'ee so hopeless well.\"\n\nCoggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called\nat the vicar's in a manner which excited no curiosity at all.  Then\nGabriel went home, and prepared for the morrow.\n\n\n\"Liddy,\" said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, \"I want you to\ncall me at seven o'clock to-morrow, In case I shouldn't wake.\"\n\n\"But you always do wake afore then, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I have something important to do, which I'll tell you of\nwhen the time comes, and it's best to make sure.\"\n\nBathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she by any\ncontrivance get to sleep again.  About six, being quite positive that\nher watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer.\nShe went and tapped at Liddy's door, and after some labour awoke her.\n\n\"But I thought it was I who had to call you?\" said the bewildered\nLiddy.  \"And it isn't six yet.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?  I know it must\nbe ever so much past seven.  Come to my room as soon as you can; I\nwant you to give my hair a good brushing.\"\n\nWhen Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress was already waiting.\nLiddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness.  \"Whatever\nIS going on, ma'am?\" she said.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in\nher bright eyes.  \"Farmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!\"\n\n\"Farmer Oak--and nobody else?--you two alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?\" asked her companion,\ndubiously.  \"A woman's good name is such a perishable article that--\"\n\nBathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy's ear,\nalthough there was nobody present.  Then Liddy stared and exclaimed,\n\"Souls alive, what news!  It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!\"\n\n\"It makes mine rather furious, too,\" said Bathsheba.  \"However,\nthere's no getting out of it now!\"\n\nIt was a damp disagreeable morning.  Nevertheless, at twenty minutes\nto ten o'clock, Oak came out of his house, and\n\n\n              Went up the hill side\n              With that sort of stride\n     A man puts out when walking in search of a bride,\n\n\nand knocked Bathsheba's door.  Ten minutes later a large and a\nsmaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and\nthrough the mist along the road to the church.  The distance was not\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed\nit unnecessary to drive.  An observer must have been very close\nindeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of\nOak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak\nin a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that\nreached her clogs.  Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a\ncertain rejuvenated appearance about her:--\n\n\n     As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.\n\n\nRepose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's\nrequest, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago\non Norcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of\nthat fascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only\nthree or four-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful.  In the\nchurch were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short\nspace of time the deed was done.\n\nThe two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour in the\nevening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak\nshould go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house,\nnor furniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards\nthem, whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all\nthree.\n\nJust as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were\ngreeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a\ntremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.\n\n\"There!\" said Oak, laughing, \"I knew those fellows were up to\nsomething, by the look on their faces\"\n\nOak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba\nwith a shawl over her head.  The rays fell upon a group of male\nfigures gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the\nnewly-married couple in the porch, set up a loud \"Hurrah!\" and at the\nsame moment bang again went the cannon in the background, followed by\na hideous clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent,\nhautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass--the only remaining relics\nof the true and original Weatherbury band--venerable worm-eaten\ninstruments, which had celebrated in their own persons the victories\nof Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers of those who\nplayed them now.  The performers came forward, and marched up to the\nfront.\n\n\"Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all\nthis,\" said Oak.  \"Come in, souls, and have something to eat and\ndrink wi' me and my wife.\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial.  \"Thank\nye all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly time.  However, we\ncouldn't think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration\nof some sort.  If ye could send a drop of som'at down to Warren's,\nwhy so it is.  Here's long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and\nhis comely bride!\"\n\n\"Thank ye; thank ye all,\" said Gabriel.  \"A bit and a drop shall be\nsent to Warren's for ye at once.  I had a thought that we might very\nlikely get a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was\nsaying so to my wife but now.\"\n\n\"Faith,\" said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions,\n\"the man hev learnt to say 'my wife' in a wonderful naterel way,\nconsidering how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet--hey,\nneighbours all?\"\n\n\"I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years'\nstanding pipe 'my wife' in a more used note than 'a did,\" said Jacob\nSmallbury.  \"It might have been a little more true to nater if't had\nbeen spoke a little chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just\nnow.\"\n\n\"That improvement will come wi' time,\" said Jan, twirling his eye.\n\nThen Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled (for she never laughed readily\nnow), and their friends turned to go.\n\n\"Yes; I suppose that's the size o't,\" said Joseph Poorgrass with a\ncheerful sigh as they moved away; \"and I wish him joy o' her; though\nI were once or twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea, in my\nscripture manner, which is my second nature, 'Ephraim is joined to\nidols: let him alone.'  But since 'tis as 'tis, why, it might have\nbeen worse, and I feel my thanks accordingly.\"\n\n\n","chapter_length":7668.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 54-Conclusion","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210108004047\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/far-from-the-madding-crowd\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-54-conclusion","summary_text":"After his arrest, Boldwood pleads guilty and is sentenced to death.

Boldwood meekly accepts the legal punishment, but evidence of his insanity allows for him to be granted the small mercy of imprisonment. The discovery of the items he has purchased and set aside for Bathsheba reveals his obsessive hope: given that she only confirmed their engagement the night of the party, he must have been purchasing these items well before he knew whether or not she would agree to marry him. The discovery also reveals his fixation on wealth and status: when he tried to envision how he could best please Bathsheba, Boldwood assumed jewels and fine clothes must be the key to her heart. With Boldwood and Troy both out of the picture, Bathsheba can finally live without the distraction of men trying to woo her. By this stage in the novel, however, it seems that some of her ambition and zest for life has been lost. She plays a less and less active role in managing the farm. Even when she learns that Gabriel plans to leave, she is not outraged and indignant so much as lost and afraid. She knows she depends on him both professionally and personally, and is afraid of what she will do without him. Bathsheba does show some of her drive towards bold action by going to Gabriel's cottage the night after he hands in his resignation. It would be considered quite improper for a woman to go alone to a man's home after dark, even though as a widow Bathsheba now has more freedom than she did as an unmarried woman. The two have always seemed to communicate honestly and freely, and Bathsheba seeks out that frankness by trying to determine why Gabriel feels compelled to leave. However, what becomes clear is that the two have actually misunderstood each other. Bathsheba took Gabriel's unwillingness to ask about her feelings as a sign that he no longer cared for her, while he assumed that her initial answer had been a final one. The establishment of a romantic relationship, and then the marriage between the two seems to signal that partnerships best arise out of mutual respect and getting to know one another over a long span of time while working towards shared goals. The marriage seems to show some promising signs of being egalitarian in that it is rooted in the partnership of running the farm, and Gabriel will be moving in to Bathsheba's house. At the same time, for the marriage to come about Bathsheba seems to need to have been tamed by her experience of loss and betrayal. She is no longer the proud and willful woman she was at the beginning of the novel, and it is only once she becomes more docile and more resigned to requiring the assistance of a man that she can accept a relationship with Gabriel. In the end, \"in allowing Oak the positions of both phallic male and castrated male, while awarding Bathsheba the contradictory position of powerful and dependent female, Hardy denies power and sexuality to neither sex\" .","summary_length":333.0,"analysis_length":529.0,"chap_int":57,"previous summary id":["chapter 56","chapter 56"],"previous chapter":["As the spring turns to summer, Bathsheba's bad mood slowly lifts. She still spends most of her time alone, though. She visits her husband's grave one day, and smiles at the fact that he now lies right next to his true love, Fanny Robin. The two of them even share a tombstone. Then she starts to cry uncontrollably. When she turns back, she finds that Gabriel Oak is standing behind her. She wipes her tears and asks if he's going into the church. He answers that he is indeed. Mr. Oak apologizes for bringing up a business matter, but he feels that he needs to tell her right away that he will soon leave England to live in California. Bathsheba begs him not to leave, but he says that there's no longer anything for him in Weatherbury. She awaits his departure with total dread, since now she'll barely have anyone left, especially no one as loyal as Gabriel. She also notices that in the weeks leading up to his departure, he starts to walk the other way whenever he sees her coming on a path. When she finally receives a letter saying that he is about to go, Bathsheba starts to cry bitter tears. Finally, she forgets her pride and goes to his house in the evening, even though it's not appropriate for a single woman to go to a single man's place at night. She complains one last time about how he's leaving her all alone. He simply answers that if she doesn't want him to leave, he won't. She just has to ask him to stay. Finally, Gabriel comes out and says that now that he has inherited Boldwood's farm , he thinks he's rich enough to marry Bathsheba. And after just a little more hemming and hawing, Bathsheba and Oak decide to get married.

The utter prostration that had followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished perceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to an end.\" In summer, she eventually attempted to walk to town. She passed the church and heard the choir practicing. Then she stood before Fanny Robin's grave and read the words that Troy had had inscribed. Beneath them was a new inscription: \"In the same Grave lie The Remains of the aforesaid Francis Troy. . . .\" The children in the church were rehearsing a hymn, \"Lead, Kindly Light.\" Bathsheba, recalling all that had happened, wept. Oak approached. He had been inside the church, singing with the choir. Their talk was formal, Bathsheba addressing him as Mr. Oak. As they walked back, Gabriel spoke of his plans to leave England and go to California. He admitted that he had an option to buy Boldwood's farm, but he had decided merely to finish out his year as manager. Bathsheba was upset that Gabriel, whom she now considered an old friend, would no longer be there to help her. Gabriel answered that her very helplessness was another reason for his planned departure. From that day on, he avoided Bathsheba. Fall and winter passed, and when Bathsheba finally received the long-expected letter of resignation from Oak, she wept bitterly. Then she donned her bonnet and went to his house. He did not realize it was she at first -- then, apologetically, he admitted her. His bachelor quarters had no comforts, he said, for ladies. Bathsheba asked if she had offended him. Gabriel explained that, on the contrary, he was leaving because there was gossip that he was waiting to buy Boldwood's farm just so that he would be rich enough to court Bathsheba. \"Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been discharged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected. 'Marrying me! I didn't know it was that you meant. . . . Such a thing as that is too absurd -- too soon -- to think of, by far!'\" Gabriel heard only the \"absurd,\" not the \"too soon,\" and their talk continued at cross-purposes until Gabriel said that he wished he knew if she would let him court her. Bathsheba tearfully assured him that he would never know whether she would have him unless he asked. The two found release in laughter, finally throwing off the inhibitions and constraints of employer and employee. To Bathsheba's embarrassed remark that she had come courting him, Gabriel replied that it was his due for having long danced to her tune. \"They spoke very little of their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably unnecessary between such tried friends. . . . when the two who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each other's character, and not the best till further on.\""],"next summary id":"chapters 54-57","next chapter":"After his arrest, Boldwood pleads guilty and is sentenced to death.

On the way home he heard\na heavy tread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to\nbe Coggan.  They walked together into the village until they came to\na little lane behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban\nTall, who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was\nyet in mortal terror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone\nvoice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured\nto follow him.\n\n\"Well, good-night, Coggan,\" said Oak, \"I'm going down this way.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Coggan, surprised; \"what's going on to-night then, make so\nbold Mr. Oak?\"\n\nIt seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the\ncircumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time\nof Gabriel's unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, \"You can\nkeep a secret, Coggan?\"\n\n\"You've proved me, and you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, and I do know.

And you be now\ngoing down to the clerk.\"\n\n\"Yes; you may as well come with me.\"\n\n\"I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,\"\nsaid Coggan, as they walked along.  \"Labe Tall's old woman will horn\nit all over parish in half-an-hour.\"\n\n\"So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,\" said Oak,\npausing.  \"Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he's working\nso far off, and leaves early.\"\n\n\"I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her,\" said Coggan.  \"I'll knock\nand ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the\nbackground.

Mrs. Tall herself opened it.\n\n\"I wanted to have a word with Laban.\"\n\n\"He's not at home, and won't be this side of eleven o'clock.  He've\nbeen forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work.  I shall\ndo quite as well.\"\n\n\"I hardly think you will.

About six, being quite positive that\nher watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer.\nShe went and tapped at Liddy's door, and after some labour awoke her.\n\n\"But I thought it was I who had to call you?\" said the bewildered\nLiddy.  \"And it isn't six yet.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?  I know it must\nbe ever so much past seven.  Come to my room as soon as you can; I\nwant you to give my hair a good brushing.\"\n\nWhen Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress was already waiting.\nLiddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness.  \"Whatever\nIS going on, ma'am?\" she said.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in\nher bright eyes.  \"Farmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!\"\n\n\"Farmer Oak--and nobody else?--you two alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?\" asked her companion,\ndubiously.  \"A woman's good name is such a perishable article that--\"\n\nBathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy's ear,\nalthough there was nobody present.  Then Liddy stared and exclaimed,\n\"Souls alive, what news!  It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!\"\n\n\"It makes mine rather furious, too,\" said Bathsheba.  \"However,\nthere's no getting out of it now!\"\n\nIt was a damp disagreeable morning.  Nevertheless, at twenty minutes\nto ten o'clock, Oak came out of his house, and\n\n\n              Went up the hill side\n              With that sort of stride\n     A man puts out when walking in search of a bride,\n\n\nand knocked Bathsheba's door.  Ten minutes later a large and a\nsmaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and\nthrough the mist along the road to the church.  The distance was not\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed\nit unnecessary to drive.  An observer must have been very close\nindeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of\nOak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak\nin a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that\nreached her clogs.  Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a\ncertain rejuvenated appearance about her:--\n\n\n     As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.\n\n\nRepose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's\nrequest, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago\non Norcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of\nthat fascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only\nthree or four-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful.  In the\nchurch were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short\nspace of time the deed was done.\n\nThe two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour in the\nevening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak\nshould go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house,\nnor furniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards\nthem, whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all\nthree.\n\nJust as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were\ngreeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a\ntremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.\n\n\"There!\" said Oak, laughing, \"I knew those fellows were up to\nsomething, by the look on their faces\"\n\nOak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba\nwith a shawl over her head.  The rays fell upon a group of male\nfigures gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the\nnewly-married couple in the porch, set up a loud \"Hurrah!\" and at the\nsame moment bang again went the cannon in the background, followed by\na hideous clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent,\nhautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass--the only remaining relics\nof the true and original Weatherbury band--venerable worm-eaten\ninstruments, which had celebrated in their own persons the victories\nof Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers of those who\nplayed them now.  The performers came forward, and marched up to the\nfront.\n\n\"Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all\nthis,\" said Oak.  \"Come in, souls, and have something to eat and\ndrink wi' me and my wife.\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial.  \"Thank\nye all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly time.  However, we\ncouldn't think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration\nof some sort.  If ye could send a drop of som'at down to Warren's,\nwhy so it is.  Here's long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and\nhis comely bride!\"\n\n\"Thank ye; thank ye all,\" said Gabriel.  \"A bit and a drop shall be\nsent to Warren's for ye at once.  I had a thought that we might very\nlikely get a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was\nsaying so to my wife but now.\"\n\n\"Faith,\" said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions,\n\"the man hev learnt to say 'my wife' in a wonderful naterel way,\nconsidering how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet--hey,\nneighbours all?\"\n\n\"I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years'\nstanding pipe 'my wife' in a more used note than 'a did,\" said Jacob\nSmallbury.  \"It might have been a little more true to nater if't had\nbeen spoke a little chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just\nnow.\"\n\n\"That improvement will come wi' time,\" said Jan, twirling his eye.\n\nThen Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled (for she never laughed readily\nnow), and their friends turned to go.\n\n\"Yes; I suppose that's the size o't,\" said Joseph Poorgrass with a\ncheerful sigh as they moved away; \"and I wish him joy o' her; though\nI were once or twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea, in my\nscripture manner, which is my second nature, 'Ephraim is joined to\nidols: let him alone.'  But since 'tis as 'tis, why, it might have\nbeen worse, and I feel my thanks accordingly.\"\n\n\n","chapter_length":1778.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 57","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201219162644\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/far-from-the-madding-crowd\/summary\/chapter-57","summary_text":"Gabriel and Bathsheba agree to have the plainest, most secretive wedding they can possibly have.

She still spends most of her time alone, though. She visits her husband's grave one day, and smiles at the fact that he now lies right next to his true love, Fanny Robin. The two of them even share a tombstone. Then she starts to cry uncontrollably. When she turns back, she finds that Gabriel Oak is standing behind her. She wipes her tears and asks if he's going into the church. He answers that he is indeed. Mr. Oak apologizes for bringing up a business matter, but he feels that he needs to tell her right away that he will soon leave England to live in California. Bathsheba begs him not to leave, but he says that there's no longer anything for him in Weatherbury. She awaits his departure with total dread, since now she'll barely have anyone left, especially no one as loyal as Gabriel. She also notices that in the weeks leading up to his departure, he starts to walk the other way whenever he sees her coming on a path. When she finally receives a letter saying that he is about to go, Bathsheba starts to cry bitter tears. Finally, she forgets her pride and goes to his house in the evening, even though it's not appropriate for a single woman to go to a single man's place at night. She complains one last time about how he's leaving her all alone. He simply answers that if she doesn't want him to leave, he won't. She just has to ask him to stay. Finally, Gabriel comes out and says that now that he has inherited Boldwood's farm , he thinks he's rich enough to marry Bathsheba. And after just a little more hemming and hawing, Bathsheba and Oak decide to get married. If she'd only said yes at the beginning of the book, she could have saved everyone a lot of trouble.","\"Bathsheba revived with the spring. The utter prostration that had followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished perceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to an end.\" In summer, she eventually attempted to walk to town. She passed the church and heard the choir practicing. Then she stood before Fanny Robin's grave and read the words that Troy had had inscribed. Beneath them was a new inscription: \"In the same Grave lie The Remains of the aforesaid Francis Troy. . . .\" The children in the church were rehearsing a hymn, \"Lead, Kindly Light.\" Bathsheba, recalling all that had happened, wept. Oak approached. He had been inside the church, singing with the choir. Their talk was formal, Bathsheba addressing him as Mr. Oak. As they walked back, Gabriel spoke of his plans to leave England and go to California. He admitted that he had an option to buy Boldwood's farm, but he had decided merely to finish out his year as manager. Bathsheba was upset that Gabriel, whom she now considered an old friend, would no longer be there to help her. Gabriel answered that her very helplessness was another reason for his planned departure. From that day on, he avoided Bathsheba. Fall and winter passed, and when Bathsheba finally received the long-expected letter of resignation from Oak, she wept bitterly. Then she donned her bonnet and went to his house. He did not realize it was she at first -- then, apologetically, he admitted her. His bachelor quarters had no comforts, he said, for ladies. Bathsheba asked if she had offended him. Gabriel explained that, on the contrary, he was leaving because there was gossip that he was waiting to buy Boldwood's farm just so that he would be rich enough to court Bathsheba. \"Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been discharged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected. 'Marrying me! I didn't know it was that you meant. . . . Such a thing as that is too absurd -- too soon -- to think of, by far!'\" Gabriel heard only the \"absurd,\" not the \"too soon,\" and their talk continued at cross-purposes until Gabriel said that he wished he knew if she would let him court her. Bathsheba tearfully assured him that he would never know whether she would have him unless he asked. The two found release in laughter, finally throwing off the inhibitions and constraints of employer and employee. To Bathsheba's embarrassed remark that she had come courting him, Gabriel replied that it was his due for having long danced to her tune. \"They spoke very little of their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably unnecessary between such tried friends. . . . when the two who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each other's character, and not the best till further on.\""],"next summary id":"chapter 57","next chapter":"Gabriel and Bathsheba agree to have the plainest, most secretive wedding they can possibly have.

Ten minutes later a large and a\nsmaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and\nthrough the mist along the road to the church.  The distance was not\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed\nit unnecessary to drive.  An observer must have been very close\nindeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of\nOak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak\nin a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that\nreached her clogs.  Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a\ncertain rejuvenated appearance about her:--\n\n\n     As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.\n\n\nRepose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's\nrequest, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago\non Norcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of\nthat fascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only\nthree or four-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful.  In the\nchurch were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short\nspace of time the deed was done.\n\nThe two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour in the\nevening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak\nshould go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house,\nnor furniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards\nthem, whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all\nthree.\n\nJust as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were\ngreeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a\ntremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.\n\n\"There!\" said Oak, laughing, \"I knew those fellows were up to\nsomething, by the look on their faces\"\n\nOak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba\nwith a shawl over her head.  The rays fell upon a group of male\nfigures gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the\nnewly-married couple in the porch, set up a loud \"Hurrah!\" and at the\nsame moment bang again went the cannon in the background, followed by\na hideous clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent,\nhautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass--the only remaining relics\nof the true and original Weatherbury band--venerable worm-eaten\ninstruments, which had celebrated in their own persons the victories\nof Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers of those who\nplayed them now.  The performers came forward, and marched up to the\nfront.\n\n\"Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all\nthis,\" said Oak.  \"Come in, souls, and have something to eat and\ndrink wi' me and my wife.\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial.  \"Thank\nye all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly time.  However, we\ncouldn't think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration\nof some sort.  If ye could send a drop of som'at down to Warren's,\nwhy so it is.  Here's long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and\nhis comely bride!\"\n\n\"Thank ye; thank ye all,\" said Gabriel.  \"A bit and a drop shall be\nsent to Warren's for ye at once.  I had a thought that we might very\nlikely get a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was\nsaying so to my wife but now.\"\n\n\"Faith,\" said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions,\n\"the man hev learnt to say 'my wife' in a wonderful naterel way,\nconsidering how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet--hey,\nneighbours all?\"\n\n\"I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years'\nstanding pipe 'my wife' in a more used note than 'a did,\" said Jacob\nSmallbury.  \"It might have been a little more true to nater if't had\nbeen spoke a little chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just\nnow.\"\n\n\"That improvement will come wi' time,\" said Jan, twirling his eye.\n\nThen Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled (for she never laughed readily\nnow), and their friends turned to go.\n\n\"Yes; I suppose that's the size o't,\" said Joseph Poorgrass with a\ncheerful sigh as they moved away; \"and I wish him joy o' her; though\nI were once or twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea, in my\nscripture manner, which is my second nature, 'Ephraim is joined to\nidols: let him alone.'

She still spends most of her time alone, though. She visits her husband's grave one day, and smiles at the fact that he now lies right next to his true love, Fanny Robin. The two of them even share a tombstone. Then she starts to cry uncontrollably. When she turns back, she finds that Gabriel Oak is standing behind her. She wipes her tears and asks if he's going into the church. He answers that he is indeed. Mr. Oak apologizes for bringing up a business matter, but he feels that he needs to tell her right away that he will soon leave England to live in California. Bathsheba begs him not to leave, but he says that there's no longer anything for him in Weatherbury. She awaits his departure with total dread, since now she'll barely have anyone left, especially no one as loyal as Gabriel. She also notices that in the weeks leading up to his departure, he starts to walk the other way whenever he sees her coming on a path. When she finally receives a letter saying that he is about to go, Bathsheba starts to cry bitter tears. Finally, she forgets her pride and goes to his house in the evening, even though it's not appropriate for a single woman to go to a single man's place at night. She complains one last time about how he's leaving her all alone. He simply answers that if she doesn't want him to leave, he won't. She just has to ask him to stay. Finally, Gabriel comes out and says that now that he has inherited Boldwood's farm , he thinks he's rich enough to marry Bathsheba. And after just a little more hemming and hawing, Bathsheba and Oak decide to get married.

The utter prostration that had followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished perceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to an end.\" In summer, she eventually attempted to walk to town. She passed the church and heard the choir practicing. Then she stood before Fanny Robin's grave and read the words that Troy had had inscribed. Beneath them was a new inscription: \"In the same Grave lie The Remains of the aforesaid Francis Troy. . . .\" The children in the church were rehearsing a hymn, \"Lead, Kindly Light.\" Bathsheba, recalling all that had happened, wept. Oak approached. He had been inside the church, singing with the choir. Their talk was formal, Bathsheba addressing him as Mr. Oak. As they walked back, Gabriel spoke of his plans to leave England and go to California. He admitted that he had an option to buy Boldwood's farm, but he had decided merely to finish out his year as manager. Bathsheba was upset that Gabriel, whom she now considered an old friend, would no longer be there to help her. Gabriel answered that her very helplessness was another reason for his planned departure. From that day on, he avoided Bathsheba. Fall and winter passed, and when Bathsheba finally received the long-expected letter of resignation from Oak, she wept bitterly. Then she donned her bonnet and went to his house. He did not realize it was she at first -- then, apologetically, he admitted her. His bachelor quarters had no comforts, he said, for ladies. Bathsheba asked if she had offended him. Gabriel explained that, on the contrary, he was leaving because there was gossip that he was waiting to buy Boldwood's farm just so that he would be rich enough to court Bathsheba. \"Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been discharged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected. 'Marrying me! I didn't know it was that you meant. . . . Such a thing as that is too absurd -- too soon -- to think of, by far!'\" Gabriel heard only the \"absurd,\" not the \"too soon,\" and their talk continued at cross-purposes until Gabriel said that he wished he knew if she would let him court her. Bathsheba tearfully assured him that he would never know whether she would have him unless he asked. The two found release in laughter, finally throwing off the inhibitions and constraints of employer and employee. To Bathsheba's embarrassed remark that she had come courting him, Gabriel replied that it was his due for having long danced to her tune. \"They spoke very little of their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably unnecessary between such tried friends. . . . when the two who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each other's character, and not the best till further on.\""],"next summary id":"chapter 57","next chapter":"\"'The most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to have.'

The party is talked about all over Weatherbury, largely because it is so unusual for Boldwood to give a party. He has decorated his long hall meticulously, but, we are told, \\\"In spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting in the atmosphere of the house\\\"; Boldwood is not a natural host. Bathsheba is dressing for the party. She tells Liddy, \\\"I am foolishly agitated: I am the cause of the party, and that upsets me!\\\" She decides to continue to wear her mourning and dress in black for the festivities. Boldwood, too, is dressing and has given an inordinate amount of attention to his clothes, hiring a tailor to alter everything. Gabriel visits him and Boldwood asks for his assistance in tying his tie. He asks, \\\"'Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?'\\\" and Gabriel answers, \\\"If it is not inconvenient to her she may.'\\\" Gabriel warns him not to build too much on promises, and it is clear that Boldwood harbors fear of Bathsheba's refusal; he is highly agitated. We also see Troy and Pennyways as they prepare to go to Boldwood's party. Troy asks Pennyways about Bathsheba's relationships with Boldwood and Gabriel. Troy finally sets off for the party in disguise, thinking that Bathsheba is on the verge of marrying Boldwood. He plans to arrive at nine. Now we are shown Boldwood at his farm again, as he offers Gabriel a larger part of the farm's profits, saying that he hopes to retire from the management altogether. Boldwood says he knows Gabriel loves Bathsheba and says he believes he has won the competition for Bathsheba, in part, because of Gabriel's \\\"goodness of heart.\\\" As the guests arrive, Boldwood shows \\\"feverish anxiety.\\\" The climax of the novel comes in Chapter 53. The villagers gather outside Boldwood's house, whispering that Troy has been seen that day in Casterbridge. The night is \\\"dark as a hedge.\\\" Boldwood is waiting desperately for Bathsheba, and the workers overhear him say, \\\"Oh my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense like this?\\\" Bathsheba arrives, and the workers try to decide whether to tell Boldwood about Troy. Then, they spot his face at the window. After an hour, Bathsheba prepares for departure, and Boldwood finds her alone in the parlor. He pressures her and she agrees to \\\"give the promise, if I must.\\\" Boldwood finally presses her to take a ring, persuading her to wear it for just that night, and she begins to cry. He is almost violent in his firmness, and she is \\\"beaten into non-resistance.\\\" Just then, a stranger is announced, and in front of the whole party, Troy announces, \\\"Bathsheba, I am come for you! \\\" She does not move. He reaches out to pull her toward him, but she shrinks back; her dread irritates Troy, who seizes her arm violently; she screams. The sound of the scream is followed by a deafening bang: Boldwood has shot Troy dead. He is about to shoot himself, as well, when a worker stops him. Boldwood leaves the hall. In the next chapter, we learn that Boldwood has turned himself in at the Casterbridge prison, while Bathsheba has tended to Troy and called for a surgeon. Troy, however, is dead. Months later, in March, Boldwood's trial occurs. The onlookers learn that Boldwood had prepared a set of ladies' dresses in expensive fabrics in a closet in his home and several sets of jewelry in packages labeled \\\"Bathsheba Boldwood. \\\" Boldwood is sentenced to death by hanging. However, the residents of Weatherbury are convinced that Boldwood is not \\\"morally responsible\\\" for his actions, and Gabriel sends a petition to the Home Secretary requesting a reconsideration of the sentence. Finally, on the eve of his execution the news comes that he has been pardoned and given \\\"confinement during Her Majesty's pleasure\\\" instead. Troy is buried in the same grave as Fanny Robin. Bathsheba's spirits slowly revive as the spring turns to summer. One day, as she is visiting the grave, she sees Gabriel singing in the church choir. He joins her at the grave and tells her that he intends to leave Weatherbury. Upset, she begs him to stay, but he will not. When she receives his official final notice as bailiff, she cries and decides to visit him at his cottage. He invites her in and explains that one of his motivations for leaving are the rumors going around the village about a romance between the two of them. After some confusion, Bathsheba admits that she has come \\\"courting him\\\" and the two agree to marry. The last chapter portrays the quiet wedding of Gabriel and Bathsheba. After the wedding, the two dine at the farm, and all the men of the village gather to sing and play for them.\", \"analysis\": \"Commentary The tension builds through the use of the villagers' comments about Troy, just as in a Greek tragedy in which the conflicts about to be unleashed are commented on by the chorus. They alone know what the reader knows--that Troy is alive and may turn up at the party. Yet also like the reader, they are powerless to intervene. The villagers articulate all the fears the readers have about how Boldwood and Bathsheba will react to Troy's presence. The tension they instill makes the somewhat melodramatic climax--Boldwood's murder of Troy--more plausible. Knowing how deeply Boldwood hopes that Troy's death will allow him to possess Bathsheba, we understand his urge to kill Troy. The scene-by-scene structure of Chapter 52 contributes to this dramatic suspense, as we imagine three separate sets of people each about to come together and each deeply anxious, wondering how it will all be resolved. Notice that Gabriel fulfills his classic role of the intelligent, sensible observer, who does not take part in the action. The final chapters serve to release this tension and to make sense of what has happened. Boldwood's trial looks back upon all the recent events and causes the readers to develop sympathy for his misdeed so that we, like the villagers, may forgive him. Similarly, by burying Troy with Fanny, Bathsheba shows acceptance of their previous bonds to each other. In the wake of these three ruined lives, only Gabriel and Bathsheba remain. Bathsheba's trip to Gabriel's cottage is the final instance of the series of intimate discussions about marriage the two have from the very outset of the novel, beginning with Gabriel's first proposal. In the previous scenes, Bathsheba has been hurt when Gabriel has not confessed his devotion to her. Here, finally, she is driven to admit her own love for him. This time, she is the one who introduces the notion of their marrying. Hardy is careful to show that the love that Gabriel and Bathsheba share is not the passion of a first love but a sadder and wiser connection. In the final scene, Jan Coggan makes a joke, and the narrator tells us, \\\"Then Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled , and their friends turned to go.\\\" While the ending is ostensibly a happy one, that happiness is tempered by all that has happened.\"}","chapter":"CONVERGING COURSES\n\n\nChristmas-eve came, and a party that Boldwood was to give in the\nevening was the great subject of talk in Weatherbury.  It was not\nthat the rarity of Christmas parties in the parish made this one a\nwonder, but that Boldwood should be the giver.  The announcement\nhad had an abnormal and incongruous sound, as if one should hear of\ncroquet-playing in a cathedral aisle, or that some much-respected\njudge was going upon the stage.  That the party was intended to be\na truly jovial one there was no room for doubt.  A large bough of\nmistletoe had been brought from the woods that day, and suspended\nin the hall of the bachelor's home.  Holly and ivy had followed in\narmfuls.  From six that morning till past noon the huge wood fire\nin the kitchen roared and sparkled at its highest, the kettle, the\nsaucepan, and the three-legged pot appearing in the midst of the\nflames like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; moreover, roasting\nand basting operations were continually carried on in front of the\ngenial blaze.\n\nAs it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into\nwhich the staircase descended, and all encumbrances were cleared out\nfor dancing.  The log which was to form the back-brand of the evening\nfire was the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could be\nneither brought nor rolled to its place; and accordingly two men were\nto be observed dragging and heaving it in by chains and levers as the\nhour of assembly drew near.\n\nIn spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting in the\natmosphere of the house.  Such a thing had never been attempted\nbefore by its owner, and it was now done as by a wrench.  Intended\ngaieties would insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs, the\norganization of the whole effort was carried out coldly, by\nhirelings, and a shadow seemed to move about the rooms, saying that\nthe proceedings were unnatural to the place and the lone man who\nlived therein, and hence not good.\n\n\nBathsheba was at this time in her room, dressing for the event.  She\nhad called for candles, and Liddy entered and placed one on each side\nof her mistress's glass.\n\n\"Don't go away, Liddy,\" said Bathsheba, almost timidly. \"I am\nfoolishly agitated--I cannot tell why.  I wish I had not been obliged\nto go to this dance; but there's no escaping now.  I have not spoken\nto Mr. Boldwood since the autumn, when I promised to see him at\nChristmas on business, but I had no idea there was to be anything of\nthis kind.\"\n\n\"But I would go now,\" said Liddy, who was going with her; for\nBoldwood had been indiscriminate in his invitations.\n\n\"Yes, I shall make my appearance, of course,\" said Bathsheba.  \"But I\nam THE CAUSE of the party, and that upsets me!--Don't tell, Liddy.\"\n\n\"Oh no, ma'am.  You the cause of it, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I am the reason of the party--I.  If it had not been for me,\n    there would never have been one.  I can't explain any more--there's\n    no more to be explained.  I wish I had never seen Weatherbury.\"\n\n    \"That's wicked of you--to wish to be worse off than you are.\"\n\n    \"No, Liddy.  I have never been free from trouble since I have lived\n    here, and this party is likely to bring me more.  Now, fetch my black\n    silk dress, and see how it sits upon me.\"\n\n    \"But you will leave off that, surely, ma'am?  You have been a\n    widow-lady fourteen months, and ought to brighten up a little on\n    such a night as this.\"\n\n    \"Is it necessary?  No; I will appear as usual, for if I were to wear\n    any light dress people would say things about me, and I should seem\n    to be rejoicing when I am solemn all the time.  The party doesn't\n    suit me a bit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.\"\n\n    Boldwood was dressing also at this hour.  A tailor from Casterbridge\n    was with him, assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat\n    that had just been brought home.\n\n    Never had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable about the fit,\n    and generally difficult to please.  The tailor walked round and round\n    him, tugged at the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar,\n    and for the first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored.\n    Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against all such\n    niceties as childish, but now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever\n    was provoked by this man for attaching as much importance to a crease\n    in the coat as to an earthquake in South America.  Boldwood at last\n    expressed himself nearly satisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor\n    passing out of the door just as Oak came in to report progress for\n    the day.\n\n    \"Oh, Oak,\" said Boldwood.  \"I shall of course see you here to-night.\n    Make yourself merry.  I am determined that neither expense nor\n    trouble shall be spared.\"\n\n    \"I'll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not be very early,\"\n    said Gabriel, quietly.  \"I am glad indeed to see such a change in\n    'ee from what it used to be.\"\n\n    \"Yes--I must own it--I am bright to-night: cheerful and more than\n    cheerful--so much so that I am almost sad again with the sense that\n    all of it is passing away.  And sometimes, when I am excessively\n    hopeful and blithe, a trouble is looming in the distance: so that I\n    often get to look upon gloom in me with content, and to fear a happy\n    mood.  Still this may be absurd--I feel that it is absurd.  Perhaps\n    my day is dawning at last.\"\n\n    \"I hope it 'ill be a long and a fair one.\"\n\n    \"Thank you--thank you.  Yet perhaps my cheerfulness rests on a\n    slender hope.  And yet I trust my hope.  It is faith, not hope.  I\n    think this time I reckon with my host.--Oak, my hands are a little\n    shaky, or something; I can't tie this neckerchief properly.  Perhaps\n    you will tie it for me.  The fact is, I have not been well lately,\n    you know.\"\n\n    \"I am sorry to hear that, sir.\"\n\n    \"Oh, it's nothing.  I want it done as well as you can, please.  Is\n    there any late knot in fashion, Oak?\"\n\n    \"I don't know, sir,\" said Oak.  His tone had sunk to sadness.\n\n    Boldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the neckerchief the\n    farmer went on feverishly--\n\n    \"Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?\"\n\n    \"If it is not inconvenient to her she may.\"\n\n    \"--Or rather an implied promise.\"\n\n    \"I won't answer for her implying,\" said Oak, with faint bitterness.\n    \"That's a word as full o' holes as a sieve with them.\"\n\n    \"Oak, don't talk like that.  You have got quite cynical lately--how\n    is it?  We seem to have shifted our positions: I have become the\n    young and hopeful man, and you the old and unbelieving one.  However,\n    does a woman keep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on an\n    engagement to marry at some time?  Now you know women better than\n    I--tell me.\"\n\n    \"I am afeard you honour my understanding too much.  However, she may\n    keep such a promise, if it is made with an honest meaning to repair\n    a wrong.\"\n\n    \"It has not gone far yet, but I think it will soon--yes, I know it\n    will,\" he said, in an impulsive whisper.  \"I have pressed her upon\n    the subject, and she inclines to be kind to me, and to think of me\n    as a husband at a long future time, and that's enough for me.  How\n    can I expect more?  She has a notion that a woman should not marry\n    within seven years of her husband's disappearance--that her own self\n    shouldn't, I mean--because his body was not found.  It may be merely\n    this legal reason which influences her, or it may be a religious\n    one, but she is reluctant to talk on the point. Yet she has\n    promised--implied--that she will ratify an engagement to-night.\"\n\n    \"Seven years,\" murmured Oak.\n\n    \"No, no--it's no such thing!\" he said, with impatience.  \"Five years,\n    nine months, and a few days.  Fifteen months nearly have passed since\n    he vanished, and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of\n    little more than five years?\"\n\n    \"It seems long in a forward view.  Don't build too much upon such\n    promises, sir.  Remember, you have once be'n deceived.  Her meaning\n    may be good; but there--she's young yet.\"\n\n    \"Deceived?  Never!\" said Boldwood, vehemently.  \"She never promised\n    me at that first time, and hence she did not break her promise!  If\n    she promises me, she'll marry me.  Bathsheba is a woman to her word.\"\n\n    Troy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart tavern at\n    Casterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming mixture from a glass.\n    A knock was given at the door, and Pennyways entered.\n\n    \"Well, have you seen him?\" Troy inquired, pointing to a chair.\n\n    \"Boldwood?\"\n\n    \"No--Lawyer Long.\"\n\n    \"He wadn' at home.  I went there first, too.\"\n\n    \"That's a nuisance.\"\n\n    \"'Tis rather, I suppose.\"\n\n    \"Yet I don't see that, because a man appears to be drowned and was\n    not, he should be liable for anything.  I shan't ask any lawyer--not\n    I.\"\n\n    \"But that's not it, exactly.  If a man changes his name and so forth,\n    and takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife, he's a cheat,\n    and that in the eye of the law is ayless a rogue, and that is ayless\n    a lammocken vagabond; and that's a punishable situation.\"\n\n    \"Ha-ha!  Well done, Pennyways,\" Troy had laughed, but it was with\n    some anxiety that he said, \"Now, what I want to know is this, do you\n    think there's really anything going on between her and Boldwood?\n    Upon my soul, I should never have believed it!  How she must detest\n    me!  Have you found out whether she has encouraged him?\"\n\n    \"I haen't been able to learn.  There's a deal of feeling on his side\n    seemingly, but I don't answer for her.  I didn't know a word about\n    any such thing till yesterday, and all I heard then was that she was\n    gwine to the party at his house to-night.  This is the first time she\n    has ever gone there, they say.  And they say that she've not so much\n    as spoke to him since they were at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk\n    believe o't?  However, she's not fond of him--quite offish and quite\n    careless, I know.\"\n\n    \"I'm not so sure of that....  She's a handsome woman, Pennyways, is\n    she not?  Own that you never saw a finer or more splendid creature\n    in your life.  Upon my honour, when I set eyes upon her that day I\n    wondered what I could have been made of to be able to leave her by\n    herself so long.  And then I was hampered with that bothering show,\n    which I'm free of at last, thank the stars.\"  He smoked on awhile,\n    and then added, \"How did she look when you passed by yesterday?\"\n\n    \"Oh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well fancy; but she looked\n    well enough, far's I know.  Just flashed her haughty eyes upon my\n    poor scram body, and then let them go past me to what was yond, much\n    as if I'd been no more than a leafless tree.  She had just got off\n    her mare to look at the last wring-down of cider for the year; she\n    had been riding, and so her colours were up and her breath rather\n    quick, so that her bosom plimmed and fell--plimmed and fell--every\n    time plain to my eye.  Ay, and there were the fellers round her\n    wringing down the cheese and bustling about and saying, 'Ware o' the\n    pommy, ma'am: 'twill spoil yer gown.'  'Never mind me,' says she.\n    Then Gabe brought her some of the new cider, and she must needs go\n    drinking it through a strawmote, and not in a nateral way at all.\n    'Liddy,' says she, 'bring indoors a few gallons, and I'll make some\n    cider-wine.'  Sergeant, I was no more to her than a morsel of scroff\n    in the fuel-house!\"\n\n    \"I must go and find her out at once--O yes, I see that--I must go.\n    Oak is head man still, isn't he?\"\n\n    \"Yes, 'a b'lieve.  And at Little Weatherbury Farm too.  He manages\n    everything.\"\n\n    \"'Twill puzzle him to manage her, or any other man of his compass!\"\n\n    \"I don't know about that.  She can't do without him, and knowing it\n    well he's pretty independent.  And she've a few soft corners to her\n    mind, though I've never been able to get into one, the devil's in't!\"\n\n    \"Ah, baily, she's a notch above you, and you must own it: a higher\n    class of animal--a finer tissue.  However, stick to me, and neither\n    this haughty goddess, dashing piece of womanhood, Juno-wife of mine\n    (Juno was a goddess, you know), nor anybody else shall hurt you.  But\n    all this wants looking into, I perceive.  What with one thing and\n    another, I see that my work is well cut out for me.\"\n\n    \"How do I look to-night, Liddy?\" said Bathsheba, giving a final\n    adjustment to her dress before leaving the glass.\n\n    \"I never saw you look so well before.  Yes--I'll tell you when you\n    looked like it--that night, a year and a half ago, when you came in\n    so wildlike, and scolded us for making remarks about you and Mr.\n    Troy.\"\n\n    \"Everybody will think that I am setting myself to captivate Mr.\n    Boldwood, I suppose,\" she murmured.  \"At least they'll say so.  Can't\n    my hair be brushed down a little flatter? I dread going--yet I dread\n    the risk of wounding him by staying away.\"\n\n    \"Anyhow, ma'am, you can't well be dressed plainer than you are,\n    unless you go in sackcloth at once.  'Tis your excitement is what\n    makes you look so noticeable to-night.\"\n\n    \"I don't know what's the matter, I feel wretched at one time, and\n    buoyant at another.  I wish I could have continued quite alone as I\n    have been for the last year or so, with no hopes and no fears, and\n    no pleasure and no grief.\"\n\n    \"Now just suppose Mr. Boldwood should ask you--only just suppose\n    it--to run away with him, what would you do, ma'am?\"\n\n    \"Liddy--none of that,\" said Bathsheba, gravely.  \"Mind, I won't hear\n    joking on any such matter.  Do you hear?\"\n\n    \"I beg pardon, ma'am.  But knowing what rum things we women be, I\n    just said--however, I won't speak of it again.\"\n\n    \"No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever, 'twill be for\n    reasons very, very different from those you think, or others will\n    believe!  Now get my cloak, for it is time to go.\"\n\n\n    \"Oak,\" said Boldwood, \"before you go I want to mention what has been\n    passing in my mind lately--that little arrangement we made about\n    your share in the farm I mean.  That share is small, too small,\n    considering how little I attend to business now, and how much time\n    and thought you give to it.  Well, since the world is brightening\n    for me, I want to show my sense of it by increasing your proportion\n    in the partnership.  I'll make a memorandum of the arrangement which\n    struck me as likely to be convenient, for I haven't time to talk\n    about it now; and then we'll discuss it at our leisure.  My intention\n    is ultimately to retire from the management altogether, and until you\n    can take all the expenditure upon your shoulders, I'll be a sleeping\n    partner in the stock.  Then, if I marry her--and I hope--I feel I\n    shall, why--\"\n\n    \"Pray don't speak of it, sir,\" said Oak, hastily.  \"We don't know\n    what may happen.  So many upsets may befall 'ee.  There's many a\n    slip, as they say--and I would advise you--I know you'll pardon me\n    this once--not to be TOO SURE.\"\n\n    \"I know, I know.  But the feeling I have about increasing your share\n    is on account of what I know of you.  Oak, I have learnt a little\n    about your secret: your interest in her is more than that of bailiff\n    for an employer.  But you have behaved like a man, and I, as a sort\n    of successful rival--successful partly through your goodness of\n    heart--should like definitely to show my sense of your friendship\n    under what must have been a great pain to you.\"\n\n    \"O that's not necessary, thank 'ee,\" said Oak, hurriedly. \"I must get\n    used to such as that; other men have, and so shall I.\"\n\n    Oak then left him.  He was uneasy on Boldwood's account, for he saw\n    anew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man\n    he once had been.\n\n    As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone--ready and dressed to\n    receive his company--the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed\n    to pass away, and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity.  He looked out\n    of the window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the\n    sky, and the twilight deepening to darkness.\n\n    Then he went to a locked closet, and took from a locked drawer\n    therein a small circular case the size of a pillbox, and was about to\n    put it into his pocket.  But he lingered to open the cover and take\n    a momentary glance inside.  It contained a woman's finger-ring, set\n    all the way round with small diamonds, and from its appearance had\n    evidently been recently purchased.  Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its\n    many sparkles a long time, though that its material aspect concerned\n    him little was plain from his manner and mien, which were those of\n    a mind following out the presumed thread of that jewel's future\n    history.\n\n    The noise of wheels at the front of the house became audible.\n    Boldwood closed the box, stowed it away carefully in his pocket, and\n    went out upon the landing.  The old man who was his indoor factotum\n    came at the same moment to the foot of the stairs.\n\n    \"They be coming, sir--lots of 'em--a-foot and a-driving!\"\n\n    \"I was coming down this moment.  Those wheels I heard--is it Mrs.\n    Troy?\"\n\n    \"No, sir--'tis not she yet.\"\n\n    A reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood's face\n    again, but it poorly cloaked his feelings when he pronounced\n    Bathsheba's name; and his feverish anxiety continued to show its\n    existence by a galloping motion of his fingers upon the side of\n    his thigh as he went down the stairs.\n\n\n    \"How does this cover me?\" said Troy to Pennyways.  \"Nobody would\n    recognize me now, I'm sure.\"\n\n    He was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of Noachian cut, with cape\n    and high collar, the latter being erect and rigid, like a girdling\n    wall, and nearly reaching to the verge of a travelling cap which was\n    pulled down over his ears.\n\n    Pennyways snuffed the candle, and then looked up and deliberately\n    inspected Troy.\n\n    \"You've made up your mind to go then?\" he said.\n\n    \"Made up my mind?  Yes; of course I have.\"\n\n    \"Why not write to her?  'Tis a very queer corner that you have got\n    into, sergeant.  You see all these things will come to light if you\n    go back, and they won't sound well at all.  Faith, if I was you I'd\n    even bide as you be--a single man of the name of Francis.  A good\n    wife is good, but the best wife is not so good as no wife at all.\n    Now that's my outspoke mind, and I've been called a long-headed\n    feller here and there.\"\n\n    \"All nonsense!\" said Troy, angrily.  \"There she is with plenty of\n    money, and a house and farm, and horses, and comfort, and here am I\n    living from hand to mouth--a needy adventurer.  Besides, it is no use\n    talking now; it is too late, and I am glad of it; I've been seen and\n    recognized here this very afternoon.  I should have gone back to her\n    the day after the fair, if it hadn't been for you talking about the\n    law, and rubbish about getting a separation; and I don't put it off\n    any longer.  What the deuce put it into my head to run away at all, I\n    can't think!  Humbugging sentiment--that's what it was.  But what man\n    on earth was to know that his wife would be in such a hurry to get\n    rid of his name!\"\n\n    \"I should have known it.  She's bad enough for anything.\"\n\n    \"Pennyways, mind who you are talking to.\"\n\n    \"Well, sergeant, all I say is this, that if I were you I'd go abroad\n    again where I came from--'tisn't too late to do it now.  I wouldn't\n    stir up the business and get a bad name for the sake of living with\n    her--for all that about your play-acting is sure to come out, you\n    know, although you think otherwise.  My eyes and limbs, there'll\n    be a racket if you go back just now--in the middle of Boldwood's\n    Christmasing!\"\n\n    \"H'm, yes.  I expect I shall not be a very welcome guest if he has\n    her there,\" said the sergeant, with a slight laugh.  \"A sort of\n    Alonzo the Brave; and when I go in the guests will sit in silence and\n    fear, and all laughter and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in\n    the chamber burn blue, and the worms--Ugh, horrible!--Ring for some\n    more brandy, Pennyways, I felt an awful shudder just then!  Well,\n    what is there besides?  A stick--I must have a walking-stick.\"\n\n    Pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty, for\n    should Bathsheba and Troy become reconciled it would be necessary\n    to regain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her\n    husband.  \"I sometimes think she likes you yet, and is a good woman\n    at bottom,\" he said, as a saving sentence.  \"But there's no telling\n    to a certainty from a body's outside.  Well, you'll do as you like\n    about going, of course, sergeant, and as for me, I'll do as you tell\n    me.\"\n\n    \"Now, let me see what the time is,\" said Troy, after emptying his\n    glass in one draught as he stood.  \"Half-past six o'clock.  I shall\n    not hurry along the road, and shall be there then before nine.\"\n\n\n\n\nCONCURRITUR--HORAE MOMENTO\n\n\nOutside the front of Boldwood's house a group of men stood in the\ndark, with their faces towards the door, which occasionally opened\nand closed for the passage of some guest or servant, when a golden\nrod of light would stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again,\nleaving nothing outside but the glowworm shine of the pale lamp amid\nthe evergreens over the door.\n\n\"He was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon--so the boy said,\" one of\nthem remarked in a whisper.  \"And I for one believe it.  His body was\nnever found, you know.\"\n\n\"'Tis a strange story,\" said the next.  \"You may depend upon't that\nshe knows nothing about it.\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he don't mean that she shall,\" said another man.\n\n\"If he's alive and here in the neighbourhood, he means mischief,\"\nsaid the first.  \"Poor young thing: I do pity her, if 'tis true.\nHe'll drag her to the dogs.\"\n\n\"O no; he'll settle down quiet enough,\" said one disposed to take a\nmore hopeful view of the case.\n\n\"What a fool she must have been ever to have had anything to do with\nthe man!  She is so self-willed and independent too, that one is more\nminded to say it serves her right than pity her.\"\n\n\"No, no.  I don't hold with 'ee there.  She was no otherwise than a\ngirl mind, and how could she tell what the man was made of?  If 'tis\nreally true, 'tis too hard a punishment, and more than she ought to\nhae.--Hullo, who's that?\"  This was to some footsteps that were heard\napproaching.\n\n\"William Smallbury,\" said a dim figure in the shades, coming up and\njoining them.  \"Dark as a hedge, to-night, isn't it? I all but missed\nthe plank over the river ath'art there in the bottom--never did such\na thing before in my life.  Be ye any of Boldwood's workfolk?\"  He\npeered into their faces.\n\n\"Yes--all o' us.  We met here a few minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hear now--that's Sam Samway: thought I knowed the voice, too.\nGoing in?\"\n\n\"Presently.  But I say, William,\" Samway whispered, \"have ye heard\nthis strange tale?\"\n\n\"What--that about Sergeant Troy being seen, d'ye mean, souls?\" said\nSmallbury, also lowering his voice.\n\n\"Ay: in Casterbridge.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.  Laban Tall named a hint of it to me but now--but I\ndon't think it.  Hark, here Laban comes himself, 'a b'lieve.\"  A\nfootstep drew near.\n\n\"Laban?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'tis I,\" said Tall.\n\n\"Have ye heard any more about that?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tall, joining the group.  \"And I'm inclined to think we'd\nbetter keep quiet.  If so be 'tis not true, 'twill flurry her, and do\nher much harm to repeat it; and if so be 'tis true, 'twill do no good\nto forestall her time o' trouble.  God send that it mid be a lie, for\nthough Henery Fray and some of 'em do speak against her, she's never\nbeen anything but fair to me.  She's hot and hasty, but she's a brave\ngirl who'll never tell a lie however much the truth may harm her, and\nI've no cause to wish her evil.\"\n\n\"She never do tell women's little lies, that's true; and 'tis a thing\nthat can be said of very few.  Ay, all the harm she thinks she says\nto yer face: there's nothing underhand wi' her.\"\n\nThey stood silent then, every man busied with his own thoughts,\nduring which interval sounds of merriment could be heard within.\nThen the front door again opened, the rays streamed out, the\nwell-known form of Boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of\nlight, the door closed, and Boldwood walked slowly down the path.\n\n\"'Tis master,\" one of the men whispered, as he neared them. \"We'd\nbetter stand quiet--he'll go in again directly.  He would think it\nunseemly o' us to be loitering here.\"\n\nBoldwood came on, and passed by the men without seeing them, they\nbeing under the bushes on the grass.  He paused, leant over the gate,\nand breathed a long breath.  They heard low words come from him.\n\n\"I hope to God she'll come, or this night will be nothing but misery\nto me!  Oh my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense\nlike this?\"\n\nHe said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard it.  Boldwood\nremained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again\njust audible, until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be\ndistinguished coming down the hill.  They drew nearer, and ceased at\nthe gate.  Boldwood hastened back to the door, and opened it; and the\nlight shone upon Bathsheba coming up the path.\n\nBoldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome: the men marked her\nlight laugh and apology as she met him: he took her into the house;\nand the door closed again.\n\n\"Gracious heaven, I didn't know it was like that with him!\" said one\nof the men.  \"I thought that fancy of his was over long ago.\"\n\n\"You don't know much of master, if you thought that,\" said Samway.\n\n\"I wouldn't he should know we heard what 'a said for the world,\"\nremarked a third.\n\n\"I wish we had told of the report at once,\" the first uneasily\ncontinued.  \"More harm may come of this than we know of.  Poor Mr.\nBoldwood, it will be hard upon en.  I wish Troy was in--Well, God\nforgive me for such a wish!  A scoundrel to play a poor wife such\ntricks.  Nothing has prospered in Weatherbury since he came here.\nAnd now I've no heart to go in.  Let's look into Warren's for a few\nminutes first, shall us, neighbours?\"\n\nSamway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren's, and went out at\nthe gate, the remaining ones entering the house.  The three soon drew\nnear the malt-house, approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and\nnot by way of the street.  The pane of glass was illuminated as\nusual.  Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest when, pausing,\nhe turned suddenly to his companions and said, \"Hist!  See there.\"\n\nThe light from the pane was now perceived to be shining not upon the\nivied wall as usual, but upon some object close to the glass.  It was\na human face.\n\n\"Let's come closer,\" whispered Samway; and they approached on tiptoe.\nThere was no disbelieving the report any longer.  Troy's face was\nalmost close to the pane, and he was looking in.  Not only was he\nlooking in, but he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation\nwhich was in progress in the malt-house, the voices of the\ninterlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster.\n\n\"The spree is all in her honour, isn't it--hey?\" said the old man.\n\"Although he made believe 'tis only keeping up o' Christmas?\"\n\n\"I cannot say,\" replied Oak.\n\n\"Oh 'tis true enough, faith.  I cannot understand Farmer Boldwood\nbeing such a fool at his time of life as to ho and hanker after this\nwoman in the way 'a do, and she not care a bit about en.\"\n\nThe men, after recognizing Troy's features, withdrew across\nthe orchard as quietly as they had come.  The air was big with\nBathsheba's fortunes to-night: every word everywhere concerned her.\nWhen they were quite out of earshot all by one instinct paused.\n\n\"It gave me quite a turn--his face,\" said Tall, breathing.\n\n\"And so it did me,\" said Samway.  \"What's to be done?\"\n\n\"I don't see that 'tis any business of ours,\" Smallbury murmured\ndubiously.\n\n\"But it is!  'Tis a thing which is everybody's business,\" said\nSamway.  \"We know very well that master's on a wrong tack, and that\nshe's quite in the dark, and we should let 'em know at once.  Laban,\nyou know her best--you'd better go and ask to speak to her.\"\n\n\"I bain't fit for any such thing,\" said Laban, nervously.  \"I should\nthink William ought to do it if anybody.  He's oldest.\"\n\n\"I shall have nothing to do with it,\" said Smallbury.  \"'Tis a\nticklish business altogether.  Why, he'll go on to her himself in a\nfew minutes, ye'll see.\"\n\n\"We don't know that he will.  Come, Laban.\"\n\n\"Very well, if I must I must, I suppose,\" Tall reluctantly answered.\n\"What must I say?\"\n\n\"Just ask to see master.\"\n\n\"Oh no; I shan't speak to Mr. Boldwood.  If I tell anybody, 'twill be\nmistress.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Samway.\n\nLaban then went to the door.  When he opened it the hum of bustle\nrolled out as a wave upon a still strand--the assemblage being\nimmediately inside the hall--and was deadened to a murmur as he\nclosed it again.  Each man waited intently, and looked around at\nthe dark tree tops gently rocking against the sky and occasionally\nshivering in a slight wind, as if he took interest in the scene,\nwhich neither did.  One of them began walking up and down, and then\ncame to where he started from and stopped again, with a sense that\nwalking was a thing not worth doing now.\n\n\"I should think Laban must have seen mistress by this time,\" said\nSmallbury, breaking the silence.  \"Perhaps she won't come and speak\nto him.\"\n\nThe door opened.  Tall appeared, and joined them.\n\n\"Well?\" said both.\n\n\"I didn't like to ask for her after all,\" Laban faltered out.  \"They\nwere all in such a stir, trying to put a little spirit into the\nparty.  Somehow the fun seems to hang fire, though everything's there\nthat a heart can desire, and I couldn't for my soul interfere and\nthrow damp upon it--if 'twas to save my life, I couldn't!\"\n\n\"I suppose we had better all go in together,\" said Samway, gloomily.\n\"Perhaps I may have a chance of saying a word to master.\"\n\nSo the men entered the hall, which was the room selected and arranged\nfor the gathering because of its size.  The younger men and maids\nwere at last just beginning to dance.  Bathsheba had been perplexed\nhow to act, for she was not much more than a slim young maid herself,\nand the weight of stateliness sat heavy upon her.  Sometimes she\nthought she ought not to have come under any circumstances; then she\nconsidered what cold unkindness that would have been, and finally\nresolved upon the middle course of staying for about an hour only,\nand gliding off unobserved, having from the first made up her mind\nthat she could on no account dance, sing, or take any active part in\nthe proceedings.\n\nHer allotted hour having been passed in chatting and looking on,\nBathsheba told Liddy not to hurry herself, and went to the small\nparlour to prepare for departure, which, like the hall, was decorated\nwith holly and ivy, and well lighted up.\n\nNobody was in the room, but she had hardly been there a moment when\nthe master of the house entered.\n\n\"Mrs. Troy--you are not going?\" he said.  \"We've hardly begun!\"\n\n\"If you'll excuse me, I should like to go now.\"  Her manner was\nrestive, for she remembered her promise, and imagined what he was\nabout to say.  \"But as it is not late,\" she added, \"I can walk home,\nand leave my man and Liddy to come when they choose.\"\n\n\"I've been trying to get an opportunity of speaking to you,\" said\nBoldwood.  \"You know perhaps what I long to say?\"\n\nBathsheba silently looked on the floor.\n\n\"You do give it?\" he said, eagerly.\n\n\"What?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Now, that's evasion!  Why, the promise.  I don't want to intrude\nupon you at all, or to let it become known to anybody.  But do give\nyour word!  A mere business compact, you know, between two people who\nare beyond the influence of passion.\"  Boldwood knew how false this\npicture was as regarded himself; but he had proved that it was the\nonly tone in which she would allow him to approach her.  \"A promise\nto marry me at the end of five years and three-quarters.  You owe it\nto me!\"\n\n\"I feel that I do,\" said Bathsheba; \"that is, if you demand it.  But\nI am a changed woman--an unhappy woman--and not--not--\"\n\n\"You are still a very beautiful woman,\" said Boldwood.  Honesty and\npure conviction suggested the remark, unaccompanied by any perception\nthat it might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win\nher.\n\nHowever, it had not much effect now, for she said, in a passionless\nmurmur which was in itself a proof of her words: \"I have no feeling\nin the matter at all.  And I don't at all know what is right to do\nin my difficult position, and I have nobody to advise me.  But I\ngive my promise, if I must.  I give it as the rendering of a debt,\nconditionally, of course, on my being a widow.\"\n\n\"You'll marry me between five and six years hence?\"\n\n\"Don't press me too hard.  I'll marry nobody else.\"\n\n\"But surely you will name the time, or there's nothing in the promise\nat all?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, pray let me go!\" she said, her bosom beginning to\nrise.  \"I am afraid what to do! I want to be just to you, and to be\nthat seems to be wronging myself, and perhaps it is breaking the\ncommandments.  There is considerable doubt of his death, and then it\nis dreadful; let me ask a solicitor, Mr. Boldwood, if I ought or no!\"\n\n\"Say the words, dear one, and the subject shall be dismissed;\na blissful loving intimacy of six years, and then marriage--O\nBathsheba, say them!\" he begged in a husky voice, unable to sustain\nthe forms of mere friendship any longer.  \"Promise yourself to me; I\ndeserve it, indeed I do, for I have loved you more than anybody in\nthe world!  And if I said hasty words and showed uncalled-for heat\nof manner towards you, believe me, dear, I did not mean to distress\nyou; I was in agony, Bathsheba, and I did not know what I said.  You\nwouldn't let a dog suffer what I have suffered, could you but know\nit!  Sometimes I shrink from your knowing what I have felt for you,\nand sometimes I am distressed that all of it you never will know.  Be\ngracious, and give up a little to me, when I would give up my life\nfor you!\"\n\nThe trimmings of her dress, as they quivered against the light,\nshowed how agitated she was, and at last she burst out crying.  \"And\nyou'll not--press me--about anything more--if I say in five or six\nyears?\" she sobbed, when she had power to frame the words.\n\n\"Yes, then I'll leave it to time.\"\n\nShe waited a moment.  \"Very well.  I'll marry you in six years from\nthis day, if we both live,\" she said solemnly.\n\n\"And you'll take this as a token from me.\"\n\nBoldwood had come close to her side, and now he clasped one of her\nhands in both his own, and lifted it to his breast.\n\n\"What is it?  Oh I cannot wear a ring!\" she exclaimed, on seeing\nwhat he held; \"besides, I wouldn't have a soul know that it's an\nengagement!  Perhaps it is improper?  Besides, we are not engaged in\nthe usual sense, are we?  Don't insist, Mr. Boldwood--don't!\"  In her\ntrouble at not being able to get her hand away from him at once, she\nstamped passionately on the floor with one foot, and tears crowded to\nher eyes again.\n\n\"It means simply a pledge--no sentiment--the seal of a practical\ncompact,\" he said more quietly, but still retaining her hand in\nhis firm grasp.  \"Come, now!\" And Boldwood slipped the ring on her\nfinger.\n\n\"I cannot wear it,\" she said, weeping as if her heart would break.\n\"You frighten me, almost.  So wild a scheme!  Please let me go home!\"\n\n\"Only to-night: wear it just to-night, to please me!\"\n\nBathsheba sat down in a chair, and buried her face in her\nhandkerchief, though Boldwood kept her hand yet.  At length she\nsaid, in a sort of hopeless whisper--\n\n\"Very well, then, I will to-night, if you wish it so earnestly.  Now\nloosen my hand; I will, indeed I will wear it to-night.\"\n\n\"And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six\nyears, with a wedding at the end?\"\n\n\"It must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!\" she said, fairly\nbeaten into non-resistance.\n\nBoldwood pressed her hand, and allowed it to drop in her lap.  \"I am\nhappy now,\" he said.  \"God bless you!\"\n\nHe left the room, and when he thought she might be sufficiently\ncomposed sent one of the maids to her.  Bathsheba cloaked the effects\nof the late scene as she best could, followed the girl, and in a few\nmoments came downstairs with her hat and cloak on, ready to go.  To\nget to the door it was necessary to pass through the hall, and before\ndoing so she paused on the bottom of the staircase which descended\ninto one corner, to take a last look at the gathering.\n\nThere was no music or dancing in progress just now.  At the lower\nend, which had been arranged for the work-folk specially, a group\nconversed in whispers, and with clouded looks.  Boldwood was standing\nby the fireplace, and he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising\nfrom her promise that he scarcely saw anything, seemed at that moment\nto have observed their peculiar manner, and their looks askance.\n\n\"What is it you are in doubt about, men?\" he said.\n\nOne of them turned and replied uneasily: \"It was something Laban\nheard of, that's all, sir.\"\n\n\"News?  Anybody married or engaged, born or dead?\" inquired the\nfarmer, gaily.  \"Tell it to us, Tall.  One would think from your\nlooks and mysterious ways that it was something very dreadful\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir, nobody is dead,\" said Tall.\n\n\"I wish somebody was,\" said Samway, in a whisper.\n\n\"What do you say, Samway?\" asked Boldwood, somewhat sharply.  \"If you\nhave anything to say, speak out; if not, get up another dance.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Troy has come downstairs,\" said Samway to Tall.  \"If you want\nto tell her, you had better do it now.\"\n\n\"Do you know what they mean?\" the farmer asked Bathsheba, across the\nroom.\n\n\"I don't in the least,\" said Bathsheba.\n\nThere was a smart rapping at the door.  One of the men opened it\ninstantly, and went outside.\n\n\"Mrs. Troy is wanted,\" he said, on returning.\n\n\"Quite ready,\" said Bathsheba.  \"Though I didn't tell them to send.\"\n\n\"It is a stranger, ma'am,\" said the man by the door.\n\n\"A stranger?\" she said.\n\n\"Ask him to come in,\" said Boldwood.\n\nThe message was given, and Troy, wrapped up to his eyes as we have\nseen him, stood in the doorway.\n\nThere was an unearthly silence, all looking towards the newcomer.\nThose who had just learnt that he was in the neighbourhood recognized\nhim instantly; those who did not were perplexed.  Nobody noted\nBathsheba.  She was leaning on the stairs.  Her brow had heavily\ncontracted; her whole face was pallid, her lips apart, her eyes\nrigidly staring at their visitor.\n\nBoldwood was among those who did not notice that he was Troy.  \"Come\nin, come in!\" he repeated, cheerfully, \"and drain a Christmas beaker\nwith us, stranger!\"\n\nTroy next advanced into the middle of the room, took off his cap,\nturned down his coat-collar, and looked Boldwood in the face.  Even\nthen Boldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven's\npersistent irony towards him, who had once before broken in upon his\nbliss, scourged him, and snatched his delight away, had come to do\nthese things a second time.  Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh:\nBoldwood recognized him now.\n\nTroy turned to Bathsheba.  The poor girl's wretchedness at this time\nwas beyond all fancy or narration.  She had sunk down on the lowest\nstair; and there she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes\nfixed vacantly upon him, as if she wondered whether it were not all\na terrible illusion.\n\nThen Troy spoke.  \"Bathsheba, I come here for you!\"\n\nShe made no reply.\n\n\"Come home with me: come!\"\n\nBathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise.  Troy went\nacross to her.\n\n\"Come, madam, do you hear what I say?\" he said, peremptorily.\n\nA strange voice came from the fireplace--a voice sounding far off\nand confined, as if from a dungeon.  Hardly a soul in the assembly\nrecognized the thin tones to be those of Boldwood.  Sudden despair\nhad transformed him.\n\n\"Bathsheba, go with your husband!\"\n\nNevertheless, she did not move.  The truth was that Bathsheba was\nbeyond the pale of activity--and yet not in a swoon.  She was in a\nstate of mental _gutta serena_; her mind was for the minute totally\ndeprived of light at the same time no obscuration was apparent from\nwithout.\n\nTroy stretched out his hand to pull her her towards him, when she\nquickly shrank back.  This visible dread of him seemed to irritate\nTroy, and he seized her arm and pulled it sharply.  Whether his grasp\npinched her, or whether his mere touch was the cause, was never\nknown, but at the moment of his seizure she writhed, and gave a\nquick, low scream.\n\nThe scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by\nsudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied\nthem all.  The oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place\nwas filled with grey smoke.\n\nIn bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood.  At his back,\nas stood before the fireplace, was a gun-rack, as is usual in\nfarmhouses, constructed to hold two guns.  When Bathsheba had cried\nout in her husband's grasp, Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had\nchanged.  The veins had swollen, and a frenzied look had gleamed in\nhis eye.  He had turned quickly, taken one of the guns, cocked it,\nand at once discharged it at Troy.\n\nTroy fell.  The distance apart of the two men was so small that\nthe charge of shot did not spread in the least, but passed like a\nbullet into his body.  He uttered a long guttural sigh--there was\na contraction--an extension--then his muscles relaxed, and he lay\nstill.\n\nBoldwood was seen through the smoke to be now again engaged with the\ngun.  It was double-barrelled, and he had, meanwhile, in some way\nfastened his hand-kerchief to the trigger, and with his foot on the\nother end was in the act of turning the second barrel upon himself.\nSamway his man was the first to see this, and in the midst of the\ngeneral horror darted up to him.  Boldwood had already twitched\nthe handkerchief, and the gun exploded a second time, sending its\ncontents, by a timely blow from Samway, into the beam which crossed\nthe ceiling.\n\n\"Well, it makes no difference!\" Boldwood gasped.  \"There is another\nway for me to die.\"\n\nThen he broke from Samway, crossed the room to Bathsheba, and kissed\nher hand.  He put on his hat, opened the door, and went into the\ndarkness, nobody thinking of preventing him.\n\n\n\nAFTER THE SHOCK\n\n\nBoldwood passed into the high road and turned in the direction of\nCasterbridge.  Here he walked at an even, steady pace over Yalbury\nHill, along the dead level beyond, mounted Mellstock Hill, and\nbetween eleven and twelve o'clock crossed the Moor into the town.\nThe streets were nearly deserted now, and the waving lamp-flames only\nlighted up rows of grey shop-shutters, and strips of white paving\nupon which his step echoed as his passed along.  He turned to the\nright, and halted before an archway of heavy stonework, which was\nclosed by an iron studded pair of doors.  This was the entrance\nto the gaol, and over it a lamp was fixed, the light enabling the\nwretched traveller to find a bell-pull.\n\nThe small wicket at last opened, and a porter appeared.  Boldwood\nstepped forward, and said something in a low tone, when, after a\ndelay, another man came.  Boldwood entered, and the door was closed\nbehind him, and he walked the world no more.\n\nLong before this time Weatherbury had been thoroughly aroused, and\nthe wild deed which had terminated Boldwood's merrymaking became\nknown to all.  Of those out of the house Oak was one of the first to\nhear of the catastrophe, and when he entered the room, which was\nabout five minutes after Boldwood's exit, the scene was terrible.\nAll the female guests were huddled aghast against the walls like\nsheep in a storm, and the men were bewildered as to what to do.  As\nfor Bathsheba, she had changed.  She was sitting on the floor beside\nthe body of Troy, his head pillowed in her lap, where she had herself\nlifted it.  With one hand she held her handkerchief to his breast and\ncovered the wound, though scarcely a single drop of blood had flowed,\nand with the other she tightly clasped one of his.  The household\nconvulsion had made her herself again.  The temporary coma had\nceased, and activity had come with the necessity for it.  Deeds of\nendurance, which seem ordinary in philosophy, are rare in conduct,\nand Bathsheba was astonishing all around her now, for her philosophy\nwas her conduct, and she seldom thought practicable what she did\nnot practise.  She was of the stuff of which great men's mothers\nare made.  She was indispensable to high generation, hated at tea\nparties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.  Troy recumbent in\nhis wife's lap formed now the sole spectacle in the middle of the\nspacious room.\n\n\"Gabriel,\" she said, automatically, when he entered, turning up a\nface of which only the well-known lines remained to tell him it\nwas hers, all else in the picture having faded quite.  \"Ride to\nCasterbridge instantly for a surgeon.  It is, I believe, useless,\nbut go.  Mr. Boldwood has shot my husband.\"\n\nHer statement of the fact in such quiet and simple words came with\nmore force than a tragic declamation, and had somewhat the effect of\nsetting the distorted images in each mind present into proper focus.\nOak, almost before he had comprehended anything beyond the briefest\nabstract of the event, hurried out of the room, saddled a horse and\nrode away.  Not till he had ridden more than a mile did it occur to\nhim that he would have done better by sending some other man on this\nerrand, remaining himself in the house.  What had become of Boldwood?\nHe should have been looked after.  Was he mad--had there been a\nquarrel?  Then how had Troy got there?  Where had he come from?  How\ndid this remarkable reappearance effect itself when he was supposed\nby many to be at the bottom of the sea?  Oak had in some slight\nmeasure been prepared for the presence of Troy by hearing a rumour\nof his return just before entering Boldwood's house; but before he\nhad weighed that information, this fatal event had been superimposed.\nHowever, it was too late now to think of sending another messenger,\nand he rode on, in the excitement of these self-inquiries\nnot discerning, when about three miles from Casterbridge, a\nsquare-figured pedestrian passing along under the dark hedge in the\nsame direction as his own.\n\nThe miles necessary to be traversed, and other hindrances incidental\nto the lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night, delayed\nthe arrival of Mr. Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours\npassed between the time at which the shot was fired and that of his\nentering the house.  Oak was additionally detained in Casterbridge\nthrough having to give notice to the authorities of what had\nhappened; and he then found that Boldwood had also entered the town,\nand delivered himself up.\n\nIn the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into the hall at\nBoldwood's, found it in darkness and quite deserted.  He went on to\nthe back of the house, where he discovered in the kitchen an old man,\nof whom he made inquiries.\n\n\"She's had him took away to her own house, sir,\" said his informant.\n\n\"Who has?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Mrs. Troy.  'A was quite dead, sir.\"\n\nThis was astonishing information.  \"She had no right to do that,\"\nsaid the doctor.  \"There will have to be an inquest, and she should\nhave waited to know what to do.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; it was hinted to her that she had better wait till the law\nwas known.  But she said law was nothing to her, and she wouldn't let\nher dear husband's corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for\nall the crowners in England.\"\n\nMr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the hill to Bathsheba's.\nThe first person he met was poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have\ndwindled smaller in these few latter hours.  \"What has been done?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I don't know, sir,\" said Liddy, with suspended breath.  \"My mistress\nhas done it all.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Upstairs with him, sir.  When he was brought home and taken\nupstairs, she said she wanted no further help from the men.  And then\nshe called me, and made me fill the bath, and after that told me I\nhad better go and lie down because I looked so ill.  Then she locked\nherself into the room alone with him, and would not let a nurse come\nin, or anybody at all.  But I thought I'd wait in the next room in\ncase she should want me.  I heard her moving about inside for more\nthan an hour, but she only came out once, and that was for more\ncandles, because hers had burnt down into the socket.  She said we\nwere to let her know when you or Mr. Thirdly came, sir.\"\n\nOak entered with the parson at this moment, and they all went\nupstairs together, preceded by Liddy Smallbury.  Everything was\nsilent as the grave when they paused on the landing.  Liddy knocked,\nand Bathsheba's dress was heard rustling across the room: the key\nturned in the lock, and she opened the door.  Her looks were calm and\nnearly rigid, like a slightly animated bust of Melpomene.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last,\" she murmured from her lips\nmerely, and threw back the door.  \"Ah, and Mr. Thirdly.  Well, all is\ndone, and anybody in the world may see him now.\"  She then passed by\nhim, crossed the landing, and entered another room.\n\nLooking into the chamber of death she had vacated they saw by the\nlight of the candles which were on the drawers a tall straight\nshape lying at the further end of the bedroom, wrapped in white.\nEverything around was quite orderly.  The doctor went in, and after a\nfew minutes returned to the landing again, where Oak and the parson\nstill waited.\n\n\"It is all done, indeed, as she says,\" remarked Mr. Aldritch, in a\nsubdued voice.  \"The body has been undressed and properly laid out in\ngrave clothes.  Gracious Heaven--this mere girl!  She must have the\nnerve of a stoic!\"\n\n\"The heart of a wife merely,\" floated in a whisper about the ears\nof the three, and turning they saw Bathsheba in the midst of them.\nThen, as if at that instant to prove that her fortitude had been\nmore of will than of spontaneity, she silently sank down between\nthem and was a shapeless heap of drapery on the floor.  The simple\nconsciousness that superhuman strain was no longer required had at\nonce put a period to her power to continue it.\n\nThey took her away into a further room, and the medical attendance\nwhich had been useless in Troy's case was invaluable in Bathsheba's,\nwho fell into a series of fainting-fits that had a serious aspect\nfor a time.  The sufferer was got to bed, and Oak, finding from the\nbulletins that nothing really dreadful was to be apprehended on her\nscore, left the house.  Liddy kept watch in Bathsheba's chamber,\nwhere she heard her mistress, moaning in whispers through the dull\nslow hours of that wretched night: \"Oh it is my fault--how can I\nlive!  O Heaven, how can I live!\"\n\n\n\nTHE MARCH FOLLOWING--\"BATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD\"\n\n\nWe pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a breezy day without\nsunshine, frost, or dew.  On Yalbury Hill, about midway between\nWeatherbury and Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over\nthe crest, a numerous concourse of people had gathered, the eyes of\nthe greater number being frequently stretched afar in a northerly\ndirection.  The groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of\njavelin-men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst were carriages, one\nof which contained the high sheriff.  With the idlers, many of whom\nhad mounted to the top of a cutting formed for the road, were several\nWeatherbury men and boys--among others Poorgrass, Coggan, and Cain\nBall.\n\nAt the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in the expected\nquarter, and shortly after a travelling-carriage, bringing one of the\ntwo judges on the Western Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the\ntop.  The judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the\nbig-cheeked trumpeters, and a procession being formed of the vehicles\nand javelin-men, they all proceeded towards the town, excepting the\nWeatherbury men, who as soon as they had seen the judge move off\nreturned home again to their work.\n\n\"Joseph, I seed you squeezing close to the carriage,\" said Coggan, as\nthey walked.  \"Did ye notice my lord judge's face?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Poorgrass.  \"I looked hard at en, as if I would read\nhis very soul; and there was mercy in his eyes--or to speak with the\nexact truth required of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was\ntowards me.\"\n\n\"Well, I hope for the best,\" said Coggan, \"though bad that must be.\nHowever, I shan't go to the trial, and I'd advise the rest of ye\nthat bain't wanted to bide away.  'Twill disturb his mind more than\nanything to see us there staring at him as if he were a show.\"\n\n\"The very thing I said this morning,\" observed Joseph, \"'Justice is\ncome to weigh him in the balances,' I said in my reflectious way,\n'and if he's found wanting, so be it unto him,' and a bystander said\n'Hear, hear!  A man who can talk like that ought to be heard.' But I\ndon't like dwelling upon it, for my few words are my few words, and\nnot much; though the speech of some men is rumoured abroad as though\nby nature formed for such.\"\n\n\"So 'tis, Joseph.  And now, neighbours, as I said, every man bide at\nhome.\"\n\nThe resolution was adhered to; and all waited anxiously for the news\nnext day.  Their suspense was diverted, however, by a discovery which\nwas made in the afternoon, throwing more light on Boldwood's conduct\nand condition than any details which had preceded it.\n\nThat he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair until the fatal\nChristmas Eve in excited and unusual moods was known to those who had\nbeen intimate with him; but nobody imagined that there had shown in\nhim unequivocal symptoms of the mental derangement which Bathsheba\nand Oak, alone of all others and at different times, had momentarily\nsuspected.  In a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary\ncollection of articles.  There were several sets of ladies' dresses\nin the piece, of sundry expensive materials; silks and satins,\npoplins and velvets, all of colours which from Bathsheba's style of\ndress might have been judged to be her favourites.  There were two\nmuffs, sable and ermine.  Above all there was a case of jewellery,\ncontaining four heavy gold bracelets and several lockets and rings,\nall of fine quality and manufacture.  These things had been bought in\nBath and other towns from time to time, and brought home by stealth.\nThey were all carefully packed in paper, and each package was\nlabelled \"Bathsheba Boldwood,\" a date being subjoined six years in\nadvance in every instance.\n\nThese somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love\nwere the subject of discourse in Warren's malt-house when Oak entered\nfrom Casterbridge with tidings of sentence. He came in the afternoon,\nand his face, as the kiln glow shone upon it, told the tale\nsufficiently well.  Boldwood, as every one supposed he would do, had\npleaded guilty, and had been sentenced to death.\n\nThe conviction that Boldwood had not been morally responsible for his\nlater acts now became general.  Facts elicited previous to the trial\nhad pointed strongly in the same direction, but they had not been of\nsufficient weight to lead to an order for an examination into the\nstate of Boldwood's mind.  It was astonishing, now that a presumption\nof insanity was raised, how many collateral circumstances were\nremembered to which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford\nthe only explanation--among others, the unprecedented neglect of his\ncorn stacks in the previous summer.\n\nA petition was addressed to the Home Secretary, advancing\nthe circumstances which appeared to justify a request for a\nreconsideration of the sentence.  It was not \"numerously signed\"\nby the inhabitants of Casterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for\nBoldwood had never made many friends over the counter.  The shops\nthought it very natural that a man who, by importing direct from\nthe producer, had daringly set aside the first great principle of\nprovincial existence, namely that God made country villages to supply\ncustomers to county towns, should have confused ideas about the\nDecalogue.  The prompters were a few merciful men who had perhaps too\nfeelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed, and the result was\nthat evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in\na moral point of view, out of the category of wilful murder, and lead\nit to be regarded as a sheer outcome of madness.\n\nThe upshot of the petition was waited for in Weatherbury with\nsolicitous interest.  The execution had been fixed for eight o'clock\non a Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was\npassed, and up to Friday afternoon no answer had been received.  At\nthat time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither he had been\nto wish Boldwood good-bye, and turned down a by-street to avoid the\ntown.  When past the last house he heard a hammering, and lifting\nhis bowed head he looked back for a moment.  Over the chimneys he\ncould see the upper part of the gaol entrance, rich and glowing\nin the afternoon sun, and some moving figures were there.  They\nwere carpenters lifting a post into a vertical position within the\nparapet.  He withdrew his eyes quickly, and hastened on.\n\nIt was dark when he reached home, and half the village was out to\nmeet him.\n\n\"No tidings,\" Gabriel said, wearily.  \"And I'm afraid there's no\nhope.  I've been with him more than two hours.\"\n\n\"Do ye think he REALLY was out of his mind when he did it?\" said\nSmallbury.\n\n\"I can't honestly say that I do,\" Oak replied.  \"However, that we can\ntalk of another time.  Has there been any change in mistress this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"Is she downstairs?\"\n\n\"No.  And getting on so nicely as she was too.  She's but very little\nbetter now again than she was at Christmas.  She keeps on asking\nif you be come, and if there's news, till one's wearied out wi'\nanswering her.  Shall I go and say you've come?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Oak.  \"There's a chance yet; but I couldn't stay in town\nany longer--after seeing him too.  So Laban--Laban is here, isn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tall.\n\n\"What I've arranged is, that you shall ride to town the last thing\nto-night; leave here about nine, and wait a while there, getting home\nabout twelve.  If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, they\nsay there's no chance at all.\"\n\n\"I do so hope his life will be spared,\" said Liddy.  \"If it is not,\nshe'll go out of her mind too.  Poor thing; her sufferings have been\ndreadful; she deserves anybody's pity.\"\n\n\"Is she altered much?\" said Coggan.\n\n\"If you haven't seen poor mistress since Christmas, you wouldn't know\nher,\" said Liddy.  \"Her eyes are so miserable that she's not the same\nwoman.  Only two years ago she was a romping girl, and now she's\nthis!\"\n\nLaban departed as directed, and at eleven o'clock that night several\nof the villagers strolled along the road to Casterbridge and awaited\nhis arrival--among them Oak, and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba's\nmen.  Gabriel's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved, even\nthough in his conscience he felt that he ought to die; for there had\nbeen qualities in the farmer which Oak loved.  At last, when they all\nwere weary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance--\n\n\n     First dead, as if on turf it trode,\n     Then, clattering on the village road\n     In other pace than forth he yode.\n\n\n\"We shall soon know now, one way or other.\" said Coggan, and they all\nstepped down from the bank on which they had been standing into the\nroad, and the rider pranced into the midst of them.\n\n\"Is that you, Laban?\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Yes--'tis come.  He's not to die.  'Tis confinement during Her\nMajesty's pleasure.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" said Coggan, with a swelling heart.  \"God's above the devil\nyet!\"\n\n\n\nBEAUTY IN LONELINESS--AFTER ALL\n\n\nBathsheba revived with the spring.  The utter prostration that\nhad followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished\nperceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to\nan end.\n\nBut she remained alone now for the greater part of her time, and\nstayed in the house, or at furthest went into the garden.  She\nshunned every one, even Liddy, and could be brought to make no\nconfidences, and to ask for no sympathy.\n\nAs the summer drew on she passed more of her time in the open air,\nand began to examine into farming matters from sheer necessity,\nthough she never rode out or personally superintended as at former\ntimes.  One Friday evening in August she walked a little way along\nthe road and entered the village for the first time since the sombre\nevent of the preceding Christmas.  None of the old colour had as yet\ncome to her cheek, and its absolute paleness was heightened by the\njet black of her gown, till it appeared preternatural.  When she\nreached a little shop at the other end of the place, which stood\nnearly opposite to the churchyard, Bathsheba heard singing inside the\nchurch, and she knew that the singers were practising.  She crossed\nthe road, opened the gate, and entered the graveyard, the high sills\nof the church windows effectually screening her from the eyes of\nthose gathered within.  Her stealthy walk was to the nook wherein\nTroy had worked at planting flowers upon Fanny Robin's grave, and\nshe came to the marble tombstone.\n\nA motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she read the complete\ninscription.  First came the words of Troy himself:--\n\n\n     ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY\n      IN BELOVED MEMORY OF\n          FANNY ROBIN,\n    WHO DIED OCTOBER 9, 18--,\n          AGED 20 YEARS\n\n\nUnderneath this was now inscribed in new letters:--\n\n\n      IN THE SAME GRAVE LIE\n   THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID\n          FRANCIS TROY,\n   WHO DIED DECEMBER 24TH, 18--,\n          AGED 26 YEARS\n\n\nWhilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of the organ\nbegan again in the church, and she went with the same light step\nround to the porch and listened.  The door was closed, and the\nchoir was learning a new hymn.  Bathsheba was stirred by emotions\nwhich latterly she had assumed to be altogether dead within her.\nThe little attenuated voices of the children brought to her ear\nin distinct utterance the words they sang without thought or\ncomprehension--\n\n\n     Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\n       Lead Thou me on.\n\n\nBathsheba's feeling was always to some extent dependent upon her\nwhim, as is the case with many other women.  Something big came into\nher throat and an uprising to her eyes--and she thought that she\nwould allow the imminent tears to flow if they wished.  They did\nflow and plenteously, and one fell upon the stone bench beside her.\nOnce that she had begun to cry for she hardly knew what, she could\nnot leave off for crowding thoughts she knew too well.  She would\nhave given anything in the world to be, as those children were,\nunconcerned at the meaning of their words, because too innocent to\nfeel the necessity for any such expression.  All the impassioned\nscenes of her brief experience seemed to revive with added emotion at\nthat moment, and those scenes which had been without emotion during\nenactment had emotion then.  Yet grief came to her rather as a luxury\nthan as the scourge of former times.\n\nOwing to Bathsheba's face being buried in her hands she did not\nnotice a form which came quietly into the porch, and on seeing\nher, first moved as if to retreat, then paused and regarded her.\nBathsheba did not raise her head for some time, and when she looked\nround her face was wet, and her eyes drowned and dim.  \"Mr. Oak,\"\nexclaimed she, disconcerted, \"how long have you been here?\"\n\n\"A few minutes, ma'am,\" said Oak, respectfully.\n\n\"Are you going in?\" said Bathsheba; and there came from within the\nchurch as from a prompter--\n\n\n     I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,\n     Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.\n\n\n\"I was,\" said Gabriel.  \"I am one of the bass singers, you know.  I\nhave sung bass for several months.\"\n\n\"Indeed: I wasn't aware of that.  I'll leave you, then.\"\n\n\n     Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile,\n\n\nsang the children.\n\n\"Don't let me drive you away, mistress.  I think I won't go in\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Oh no--you don't drive me away.\"\n\nThen they stood in a state of some embarrassment, Bathsheba trying to\nwipe her dreadfully drenched and inflamed face without his noticing\nher.  At length Oak said, \"I've not seen you--I mean spoken to\nyou--since ever so long, have I?\"  But he feared to bring distressing\nmemories back, and interrupted himself with: \"Were you going into\nchurch?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said.  \"I came to see the tombstone privately--to see if\nthey had cut the inscription as I wished.  Mr. Oak, you needn't mind\nspeaking to me, if you wish to, on the matter which is in both our\nminds at this moment.\"\n\n\"And have they done it as you wished?\" said Oak.\n\n\"Yes.  Come and see it, if you have not already.\"\n\nSo together they went and read the tomb.  \"Eight months ago!\" Gabriel\nmurmured when he saw the date.  \"It seems like yesterday to me.\"\n\n\"And to me as if it were years ago--long years, and I had been dead\nbetween.  And now I am going home, Mr. Oak.\"\n\nOak walked after her.  \"I wanted to name a small matter to you as\nsoon as I could,\" he said, with hesitation.  \"Merely about business,\nand I think I may just mention it now, if you'll allow me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"It is that I may soon have to give up the management of your farm,\nMrs. Troy.  The fact is, I am thinking of leaving England--not yet,\nyou know--next spring.\"\n\n\"Leaving England!\" she said, in surprise and genuine disappointment.\n\"Why, Gabriel, what are you going to do that for?\"\n\n\"Well, I've thought it best,\" Oak stammered out.  \"California is the\nspot I've had in my mind to try.\"\n\n\"But it is understood everywhere that you are going to take poor Mr.\nBoldwood's farm on your own account.\"\n\n\"I've had the refusal o' it 'tis true; but nothing is settled yet,\nand I have reasons for giving up.  I shall finish out my year there\nas manager for the trustees, but no more.\"\n\n\"And what shall I do without you?  Oh, Gabriel, I don't think you\nought to go away.  You've been with me so long--through bright times\nand dark times--such old friends as we are--that it seems unkind\nalmost.  I had fancied that if you leased the other farm as master,\nyou might still give a helping look across at mine.  And now going\naway!\"\n\n\"I would have willingly.\"\n\n\"Yet now that I am more helpless than ever you go away!\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the ill fortune o' it,\" said Gabriel, in a distressed\ntone.  \"And it is because of that very helplessness that I feel bound\nto go.  Good afternoon, ma'am\" he concluded, in evident anxiety to\nget away, and at once went out of the churchyard by a path she could\nfollow on no pretence whatever.\n\nBathsheba went home, her mind occupied with a new trouble, which\nbeing rather harassing than deadly was calculated to do good by\ndiverting her from the chronic gloom of her life.  She was set\nthinking a great deal about Oak and of his wish to shun her;\nand there occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of her latter\nintercourse with him, which, trivial when singly viewed, amounted\ntogether to a perceptible disinclination for her society.  It broke\nupon her at length as a great pain that her last old disciple was\nabout to forsake her and flee.  He who had believed in her and argued\non her side when all the rest of the world was against her, had at\nlast like the others become weary and neglectful of the old cause,\nand was leaving her to fight her battles alone.\n\nThree weeks went on, and more evidence of his want of interest in\nher was forthcoming.  She noticed that instead of entering the small\nparlour or office where the farm accounts were kept, and waiting, or\nleaving a memorandum as he had hitherto done during her seclusion,\nOak never came at all when she was likely to be there, only entering\nat unseasonable hours when her presence in that part of the house\nwas least to be expected.  Whenever he wanted directions he sent a\nmessage, or note with neither heading nor signature, to which she was\nobliged to reply in the same offhand style.  Poor Bathsheba began to\nsuffer now from the most torturing sting of all--a sensation that she\nwas despised.\n\nThe autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy\nconjectures, and Christmas-day came, completing a year of her legal\nwidowhood, and two years and a quarter of her life alone.  On\nexamining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the\nsubject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive--the\nevent in the hall at Boldwood's--was not agitating her at all; but\ninstead, an agonizing conviction that everybody abjured her--for what\nshe could not tell--and that Oak was the ringleader of the recusants.\nComing out of church that day she looked round in hope that Oak,\nwhose bass voice she had heard rolling out from the gallery overhead\nin a most unconcerned manner, might chance to linger in her path in\nthe old way.  There he was, as usual, coming down the path behind\nher.  But on seeing Bathsheba turn, he looked aside, and as soon\nas he got beyond the gate, and there was the barest excuse for a\ndivergence, he made one, and vanished.\n\nThe next morning brought the culminating stroke; she had been\nexpecting it long.  It was a formal notice by letter from him that he\nshould not renew his engagement with her for the following Lady-day.\n\nBathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most bitterly.  She\nwas aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from\nGabriel, which she had grown to regard as her inalienable right for\nlife, should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this\nway.  She was bewildered too by the prospect of having to rely on her\nown resources again: it seemed to herself that she never could again\nacquire energy sufficient to go to market, barter, and sell.\nSince Troy's death Oak had attended all sales and fairs for her,\ntransacting her business at the same time with his own.  What should\nshe do now?  Her life was becoming a desolation.\n\nSo desolate was Bathsheba this evening, that in an absolute hunger\nfor pity and sympathy, and miserable in that she appeared to have\noutlived the only true friendship she had ever owned, she put on her\nbonnet and cloak and went down to Oak's house just after sunset,\nguided on her way by the pale primrose rays of a crescent moon a few\ndays old.\n\nA lively firelight shone from the window, but nobody was visible in\nthe room.  She tapped nervously, and then thought it doubtful if\nit were right for a single woman to call upon a bachelor who lived\nalone, although he was her manager, and she might be supposed to call\non business without any real impropriety.  Gabriel opened the door,\nand the moon shone upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mr. Oak,\" said Bathsheba, faintly.\n\n\"Yes; I am Mr. Oak,\" said Gabriel.  \"Who have I the honour--O how\nstupid of me, not to know you, mistress!\"\n\n\"I shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I Gabriel?\" she\nsaid, in pathetic tones.\n\n\"Well, no.  I suppose--But come in, ma'am.  Oh--and I'll get a\nlight,\" Oak replied, with some awkwardness.\n\n\"No; not on my account.\"\n\n\"It is so seldom that I get a lady visitor that I'm afraid I haven't\nproper accommodation.  Will you sit down, please? Here's a chair, and\nthere's one, too.  I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and\nare rather hard, but I--was thinking of getting some new ones.\"  Oak\nplaced two or three for her.\n\n\"They are quite easy enough for me.\"\n\nSo down she sat, and down sat he, the fire dancing in their faces,\nand upon the old furniture,\n\n\n            all a-sheenen\n     Wi' long years o' handlen, [3]\n\n   [Footnote 3: W. Barnes]\n\nthat formed Oak's array of household possessions, which sent back a\ndancing reflection in reply.  It was very odd to these two persons,\nwho knew each other passing well, that the mere circumstance of their\nmeeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward\nand constrained.  In the fields, or at her house, there had never\nbeen any embarrassment; but now that Oak had become the entertainer\ntheir lives seemed to be moved back again to the days when they were\nstrangers.\n\n\"You'll think it strange that I have come, but--\"\n\n\"Oh no; not at all.\"\n\n\"But I thought--Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the belief that I\nhave offended you, and that you are going away on that account.  It\ngrieved me very much and I couldn't help coming.\"\n\n\"Offended me!  As if you could do that, Bathsheba!\"\n\n\"Haven't I?\" she asked, gladly.  \"But, what are you going away for\nelse?\"\n\n\"I am not going to emigrate, you know; I wasn't aware that you would\nwish me not to when I told 'ee or I shouldn't ha' thought of doing\nit,\" he said, simply.  \"I have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm\nand shall have it in my own hands at Lady-day.  You know I've had a\nshare in it for some time.  Still, that wouldn't prevent my attending\nto your business as before, hadn't it been that things have been said\nabout us.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Bathsheba, in surprise.  \"Things said about you and me!\nWhat are they?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"It would be wiser if you were to, I think.  You have played the part\nof mentor to me many times, and I don't see why you should fear to do\nit now.\"\n\n\"It is nothing that you have done, this time.  The top and tail\no't is this--that I am sniffing about here, and waiting for poor\nBoldwood's farm, with a thought of getting you some day.\"\n\n\"Getting me!  What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Marrying of 'ee, in plain British.  You asked me to tell, so you\nmustn't blame me.\"\n\nBathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been\ndischarged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected.  \"Marrying\nme!  I didn't know it was that you meant,\" she said, quietly.  \"Such\na thing as that is too absurd--too soon--to think of, by far!\"\n\n\"Yes; of course, it is too absurd.  I don't desire any such thing;\nI should think that was plain enough by this time.  Surely, surely\nyou be the last person in the world I think of marrying.  It is too\nabsurd, as you say.\"\n\n\"'Too--s-s-soon' were the words I used.\"\n\n\"I must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you said, 'too\nabsurd,' and so do I.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon too!\" she returned, with tears in her eyes.  \"'Too\nsoon' was what I said.  But it doesn't matter a bit--not at all--but\nI only meant, 'too soon.'  Indeed, I didn't, Mr. Oak, and you must\nbelieve me!\"\n\nGabriel looked her long in the face, but the firelight being faint\nthere was not much to be seen.  \"Bathsheba,\" he said, tenderly and in\nsurprise, and coming closer: \"if I only knew one thing--whether you\nwould allow me to love you and win you, and marry you after all--if\nI only knew that!\"\n\n\"But you never will know,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you never ask.\"\n\n\"Oh--Oh!\" said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyousness.  \"My own\ndear--\"\n\n\"You ought not to have sent me that harsh letter this morning,\" she\ninterrupted.  \"It shows you didn't care a bit about me, and were\nready to desert me like all the rest of them!  It was very cruel of\nyou, considering I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and\nyou were the first I ever had; and I shall not forget it!\"\n\n\"Now, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking,\" he said, laughing.\n\"You know it was purely that I, as an unmarried man, carrying on a\nbusiness for you as a very taking young woman, had a proper hard part\nto play--more particular that people knew I had a sort of feeling for\n'ee; and I fancied, from the way we were mentioned together, that it\nmight injure your good name.  Nobody knows the heat and fret I have\nbeen caused by it.\"\n\n\"And was that all?\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"Oh, how glad I am I came!\" she exclaimed, thankfully, as she rose\nfrom her seat.  \"I have thought so much more of you since I fancied\nyou did not want even to see me again.  But I must be going now, or\nI shall be missed.  Why Gabriel,\" she said, with a slight laugh, as\nthey went to the door, \"it seems exactly as if I had come courting\nyou--how dreadful!\"\n\n\"And quite right too,\" said Oak.  \"I've danced at your skittish\nheels, my beautiful Bathsheba, for many a long mile, and many a long\nday; and it is hard to begrudge me this one visit.\"\n\nHe accompanied her up the hill, explaining to her the details of\nhis forthcoming tenure of the other farm.  They spoke very little\nof their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being\nprobably unnecessary between such tried friends.  Theirs was that\nsubstantial affection which arises (if any arises at all) when the\ntwo who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher\nsides of each other's character, and not the best till further on,\nthe romance growing up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic\nreality.  This good-fellowship--_camaraderie_--usually occurring\nthrough similarity of pursuits, is unfortunately seldom superadded\nto love between the sexes, because men and women associate, not in\ntheir labours, but in their pleasures merely.  Where, however, happy\ncircumstance permits its development, the compounded feeling proves\nitself to be the only love which is strong as death--that love which\nmany waters cannot quench, nor the floods drown, beside which the\npassion usually called by the name is evanescent as steam.\n\n\n\nA FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING--CONCLUSION\n\n\n\"The most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to\nhave.\"\n\nThose had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one evening, some time after\nthe event of the preceding f, and he meditated a full hour by\nthe clock upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter.\n\n\"A license--O yes, it must be a license,\" he said to himself at last.\n\"Very well, then; first, a license.\"\n\nOn a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious steps\nfrom the surrogate's door, in Casterbridge.  On the way home he heard\na heavy tread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to\nbe Coggan.  They walked together into the village until they came to\na little lane behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban\nTall, who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was\nyet in mortal terror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone\nvoice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured\nto follow him.\n\n\"Well, good-night, Coggan,\" said Oak, \"I'm going down this way.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Coggan, surprised; \"what's going on to-night then, make so\nbold Mr. Oak?\"\n\nIt seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the\ncircumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time\nof Gabriel's unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, \"You can\nkeep a secret, Coggan?\"\n\n\"You've proved me, and you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, and I do know.  Well, then, mistress and I mean to get\nmarried to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Heaven's high tower!  And yet I've thought of such a thing from time\nto time; true, I have.  But keeping it so close!  Well, there, 'tis\nno consarn of of mine, and I wish 'ee joy o' her.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Coggan.  But I assure 'ee that this great hush is not\nwhat I wished for at all, or what either of us would have wished if\nit hadn't been for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem\nhardly the thing.  Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish\nshall not be in church, looking at her--she's shy-like and nervous\nabout it, in fact--so I be doing this to humour her.\"\n\n\"Ay, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say.  And you be now\ngoing down to the clerk.\"\n\n\"Yes; you may as well come with me.\"\n\n\"I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,\"\nsaid Coggan, as they walked along.  \"Labe Tall's old woman will horn\nit all over parish in half-an-hour.\"\n\n\"So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,\" said Oak,\npausing.  \"Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he's working\nso far off, and leaves early.\"\n\n\"I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her,\" said Coggan.  \"I'll knock\nand ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the\nbackground.  Then he'll come out, and you can tell yer tale.  She'll\nnever guess what I want en for; and I'll make up a few words about\nthe farm-work, as a blind.\"\n\nThis scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and\nrapped at Mrs. Tall's door.  Mrs. Tall herself opened it.\n\n\"I wanted to have a word with Laban.\"\n\n\"He's not at home, and won't be this side of eleven o'clock.  He've\nbeen forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work.  I shall\ndo quite as well.\"\n\n\"I hardly think you will.  Stop a moment;\" and Coggan stepped round\nthe corner of the porch to consult Oak.\n\n\"Who's t'other man, then?\" said Mrs. Tall.\n\n\"Only a friend,\" said Coggan.\n\n\"Say he's wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch to-morrow morning\nat ten,\" said Oak, in a whisper.  \"That he must come without fail,\nand wear his best clothes.\"\n\n\"The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!\" said Coggan.\n\n\"It can't be helped,\" said Oak.  \"Tell her.\"\n\nSo Coggan delivered the message.  \"Mind, het or wet, blow or snow,\nhe must come,\" added Jan.  \"'Tis very particular, indeed.  The fact\nis, 'tis to witness her sign some law-work about taking shares wi'\nanother farmer for a long span o' years.  There, that's what 'tis,\nand now I've told 'ee, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn't ha' done\nif I hadn't loved 'ee so hopeless well.\"\n\nCoggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called\nat the vicar's in a manner which excited no curiosity at all.  Then\nGabriel went home, and prepared for the morrow.\n\n\n\"Liddy,\" said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, \"I want you to\ncall me at seven o'clock to-morrow, In case I shouldn't wake.\"\n\n\"But you always do wake afore then, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I have something important to do, which I'll tell you of\nwhen the time comes, and it's best to make sure.\"\n\nBathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she by any\ncontrivance get to sleep again.  About six, being quite positive that\nher watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer.\nShe went and tapped at Liddy's door, and after some labour awoke her.\n\n\"But I thought it was I who had to call you?\" said the bewildered\nLiddy.  \"And it isn't six yet.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?  I know it must\nbe ever so much past seven.  Come to my room as soon as you can; I\nwant you to give my hair a good brushing.\"\n\nWhen Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress was already waiting.\nLiddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness.  \"Whatever\nIS going on, ma'am?\" she said.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in\nher bright eyes.  \"Farmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!\"\n\n\"Farmer Oak--and nobody else?--you two alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?\" asked her companion,\ndubiously.  \"A woman's good name is such a perishable article that--\"\n\nBathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy's ear,\nalthough there was nobody present.  Then Liddy stared and exclaimed,\n\"Souls alive, what news!  It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!\"\n\n\"It makes mine rather furious, too,\" said Bathsheba.  \"However,\nthere's no getting out of it now!\"\n\nIt was a damp disagreeable morning.  Nevertheless, at twenty minutes\nto ten o'clock, Oak came out of his house, and\n\n\n              Went up the hill side\n              With that sort of stride\n     A man puts out when walking in search of a bride,\n\n\nand knocked Bathsheba's door.  Ten minutes later a large and a\nsmaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and\nthrough the mist along the road to the church.  The distance was not\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed\nit unnecessary to drive.  An observer must have been very close\nindeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of\nOak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak\nin a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that\nreached her clogs.  Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a\ncertain rejuvenated appearance about her:--\n\n\n     As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.\n\n\nRepose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's\nrequest, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago\non Norcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of\nthat fascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only\nthree or four-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful.  In the\nchurch were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short\nspace of time the deed was done.\n\nThe two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour in the\nevening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak\nshould go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house,\nnor furniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards\nthem, whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all\nthree.\n\nJust as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were\ngreeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a\ntremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.\n\n\"There!\" said Oak, laughing, \"I knew those fellows were up to\nsomething, by the look on their faces\"\n\nOak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba\nwith a shawl over her head.  The rays fell upon a group of male\nfigures gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the\nnewly-married couple in the porch, set up a loud \"Hurrah!\" and at the\nsame moment bang again went the cannon in the background, followed by\na hideous clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent,\nhautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass--the only remaining relics\nof the true and original Weatherbury band--venerable worm-eaten\ninstruments, which had celebrated in their own persons the victories\nof Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers of those who\nplayed them now.  The performers came forward, and marched up to the\nfront.\n\n\"Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all\nthis,\" said Oak.  \"Come in, souls, and have something to eat and\ndrink wi' me and my wife.\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial.  \"Thank\nye all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly time.  However, we\ncouldn't think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration\nof some sort.  If ye could send a drop of som'at down to Warren's,\nwhy so it is.

The party is talked about all over Weatherbury, largely because it is so unusual for Boldwood to give a party. He has decorated his long hall meticulously, but, we are told, \"In spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting in the atmosphere of the house\"; Boldwood is not a natural host. Bathsheba is dressing for the party. She tells Liddy, \"I am foolishly agitated: I am the cause of the party, and that upsets me!\" She decides to continue to wear her mourning and dress in black for the festivities. Boldwood, too, is dressing and has given an inordinate amount of attention to his clothes, hiring a tailor to alter everything. Gabriel visits him and Boldwood asks for his assistance in tying his tie. He asks, \"'Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?'\" and Gabriel answers, \"If it is not inconvenient to her she may.'\" Gabriel warns him not to build too much on promises, and it is clear that Boldwood harbors fear of Bathsheba's refusal; he is highly agitated.

Troy finally sets off for the party in disguise, thinking that Bathsheba is on the verge of marrying Boldwood. He plans to arrive at nine. Now we are shown Boldwood at his farm again, as he offers Gabriel a larger part of the farm's profits, saying that he hopes to retire from the management altogether. Boldwood says he knows Gabriel loves Bathsheba and says he believes he has won the competition for Bathsheba, in part, because of Gabriel's \"goodness of heart.\" As the guests arrive, Boldwood shows \"feverish anxiety.\" The climax of the novel comes in Chapter 53. The villagers gather outside Boldwood's house, whispering that Troy has been seen that day in Casterbridge. The night is \"dark as a hedge.\" Boldwood is waiting desperately for Bathsheba, and the workers overhear him say, \"Oh my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense like this?\" Bathsheba arrives, and the workers try to decide whether to tell Boldwood about Troy. Then, they spot his face at the window. After an hour, Bathsheba prepares for departure, and Boldwood finds her alone in the parlor. He pressures her and she agrees to \"give the promise, if I must.\" Boldwood finally presses her to take a ring, persuading her to wear it for just that night, and she begins to cry. He is almost violent in his firmness, and she is \"beaten into non-resistance.\" Just then, a stranger is announced, and in front of the whole party, Troy announces, \"Bathsheba, I am come for you! \" She does not move. He reaches out to pull her toward him, but she shrinks back; her dread irritates Troy, who seizes her arm violently; she screams. The sound of the scream is followed by a deafening bang: Boldwood has shot Troy dead. He is about to shoot himself, as well, when a worker stops him. Boldwood leaves the hall. In the next chapter, we learn that Boldwood has turned himself in at the Casterbridge prison, while Bathsheba has tended to Troy and called for a surgeon. Troy, however, is dead. Months later, in March, Boldwood's trial occurs. The onlookers learn that Boldwood had prepared a set of ladies' dresses in expensive fabrics in a closet in his home and several sets of jewelry in packages labeled \"Bathsheba Boldwood. \" Boldwood is sentenced to death by hanging. However, the residents of Weatherbury are convinced that Boldwood is not \"morally responsible\" for his actions, and Gabriel sends a petition to the Home Secretary requesting a reconsideration of the sentence.

Bathsheba's spirits slowly revive as the spring turns to summer. One day, as she is visiting the grave, she sees Gabriel singing in the church choir. He joins her at the grave and tells her that he intends to leave Weatherbury. Upset, she begs him to stay, but he will not. When she receives his official final notice as bailiff, she cries and decides to visit him at his cottage. He invites her in and explains that one of his motivations for leaving are the rumors going around the village about a romance between the two of them. After some confusion, Bathsheba admits that she has come \"courting him\" and the two agree to marry. The last chapter portrays the quiet wedding of Gabriel and Bathsheba. After the wedding, the two dine at the farm, and all the men of the village gather to sing and play for them.","summary_analysis":"Commentary The tension builds through the use of the villagers' comments about Troy, just as in a Greek tragedy in which the conflicts about to be unleashed are commented on by the chorus. They alone know what the reader knows--that Troy is alive and may turn up at the party. Yet also like the reader, they are powerless to intervene. The villagers articulate all the fears the readers have about how Boldwood and Bathsheba will react to Troy's presence. The tension they instill makes the somewhat melodramatic climax--Boldwood's murder of Troy--more plausible. Knowing how deeply Boldwood hopes that Troy's death will allow him to possess Bathsheba, we understand his urge to kill Troy. The scene-by-scene structure of Chapter 52 contributes to this dramatic suspense, as we imagine three separate sets of people each about to come together and each deeply anxious, wondering how it will all be resolved. Notice that Gabriel fulfills his classic role of the intelligent, sensible observer, who does not take part in the action. The final chapters serve to release this tension and to make sense of what has happened. Boldwood's trial looks back upon all the recent events and causes the readers to develop sympathy for his misdeed so that we, like the villagers, may forgive him. Similarly, by burying Troy with Fanny, Bathsheba shows acceptance of their previous bonds to each other. In the wake of these three ruined lives, only Gabriel and Bathsheba remain. Bathsheba's trip to Gabriel's cottage is the final instance of the series of intimate discussions about marriage the two have from the very outset of the novel, beginning with Gabriel's first proposal. In the previous scenes, Bathsheba has been hurt when Gabriel has not confessed his devotion to her. Here, finally, she is driven to admit her own love for him. This time, she is the one who introduces the notion of their marrying. Hardy is careful to show that the love that Gabriel and Bathsheba share is not the passion of a first love but a sadder and wiser connection. In the final scene, Jan Coggan makes a joke, and the narrator tells us, \"Then Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled , and their friends turned to go.\" While the ending is ostensibly a happy one, that happiness is tempered by all that has happened.","summary_length":840.0,"analysis_length":386.0,"chap_int":57,"previous summary id":["chapter 56","chapter 56"],"previous chapter":["As the spring turns to summer, Bathsheba's bad mood slowly lifts. She still spends most of her time alone, though. She visits her husband's grave one day, and smiles at the fact that he now lies right next to his true love, Fanny Robin. The two of them even share a tombstone. Then she starts to cry uncontrollably. When she turns back, she finds that Gabriel Oak is standing behind her. She wipes her tears and asks if he's going into the church. He answers that he is indeed. Mr. Oak apologizes for bringing up a business matter, but he feels that he needs to tell her right away that he will soon leave England to live in California. Bathsheba begs him not to leave, but he says that there's no longer anything for him in Weatherbury. She awaits his departure with total dread, since now she'll barely have anyone left, especially no one as loyal as Gabriel. She also notices that in the weeks leading up to his departure, he starts to walk the other way whenever he sees her coming on a path. When she finally receives a letter saying that he is about to go, Bathsheba starts to cry bitter tears. Finally, she forgets her pride and goes to his house in the evening, even though it's not appropriate for a single woman to go to a single man's place at night. She complains one last time about how he's leaving her all alone. He simply answers that if she doesn't want him to leave, he won't. She just has to ask him to stay. Finally, Gabriel comes out and says that now that he has inherited Boldwood's farm , he thinks he's rich enough to marry Bathsheba. And after just a little more hemming and hawing, Bathsheba and Oak decide to get married. If she'd only said yes at the beginning of the book, she could have saved everyone a lot of trouble.","\"Bathsheba revived with the spring. The utter prostration that had followed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished perceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to an end.\" In summer, she eventually attempted to walk to town. She passed the church and heard the choir practicing. Then she stood before Fanny Robin's grave and read the words that Troy had had inscribed. Beneath them was a new inscription: \"In the same Grave lie The Remains of the aforesaid Francis Troy. . . .\" The children in the church were rehearsing a hymn, \"Lead, Kindly Light.\" Bathsheba, recalling all that had happened, wept. Oak approached. He had been inside the church, singing with the choir. Their talk was formal, Bathsheba addressing him as Mr. Oak. As they walked back, Gabriel spoke of his plans to leave England and go to California. He admitted that he had an option to buy Boldwood's farm, but he had decided merely to finish out his year as manager. Bathsheba was upset that Gabriel, whom she now considered an old friend, would no longer be there to help her. Gabriel answered that her very helplessness was another reason for his planned departure. From that day on, he avoided Bathsheba. Fall and winter passed, and when Bathsheba finally received the long-expected letter of resignation from Oak, she wept bitterly. Then she donned her bonnet and went to his house. He did not realize it was she at first -- then, apologetically, he admitted her. His bachelor quarters had no comforts, he said, for ladies. Bathsheba asked if she had offended him. Gabriel explained that, on the contrary, he was leaving because there was gossip that he was waiting to buy Boldwood's farm just so that he would be rich enough to court Bathsheba. \"Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been discharged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected. 'Marrying me! I didn't know it was that you meant. . . . Such a thing as that is too absurd -- too soon -- to think of, by far!'\" Gabriel heard only the \"absurd,\" not the \"too soon,\" and their talk continued at cross-purposes until Gabriel said that he wished he knew if she would let him court her. Bathsheba tearfully assured him that he would never know whether she would have him unless he asked. The two found release in laughter, finally throwing off the inhibitions and constraints of employer and employee. To Bathsheba's embarrassed remark that she had come courting him, Gabriel replied that it was his due for having long danced to her tune. \"They spoke very little of their mutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably unnecessary between such tried friends. . . . when the two who are thrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each other's character, and not the best till further on.\""],"next summary id":"chapters 52-57","next chapter":"The novel builds toward its climax in Chapter 52, appropriately named \"Converging Courses.\" Hardy divides the chapter into seven sections, charting the activities of Boldwood, Bathsheba, Gabriel, and Troy as they prepare for and attend Boldwood's Christmas Eve party.

The gabled brick, tile, and\nfreestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument\nof lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping\nHigh Street, from the West Gateway to the mediaeval cross, and from\nthe mediaeval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping\nwas in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.\n\nFrom the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian\nknows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a\nmeasured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind.  Up this road\nfrom the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly,\nas if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through\npreoccupation and not through buoyancy.  They had emerged upon this\nroad through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower\ndown.  They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and\nof their kind, and this road appeared to offer the quickest means\nof doing so.  Though they were young, they walked with bowed heads,\nwhich gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.\n\nOne of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding\ncreature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of Tess,\nslighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes--Clare's\nsister-in-law, 'Liza-Lu.  Their pale faces seemed to have shrunk\nto half their natural size.  They moved on hand in hand, and never\nspoke a word, the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's\n\"Two Apostles\".\n\nWhen they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the\nclocks in the town struck eight.  Each gave a start at the notes,\nand, walking onward yet a few steps, they reached the first\nmilestone, standing whitely on the green margin of the grass, and\nbacked by the down, which here was open to the road.  They entered\nupon the turf, and, impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their\nwill, suddenly stood still, turned, and waited in paralyzed suspense\nbeside the stone.\n\nThe prospect from this summit was almost unlimited.  In the valley\nbeneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings\nshowing as in an isometric drawing--among them the broad cathedral\ntower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,\nthe spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,\nmore to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice,\nwhere to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.\nBehind the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine's Hill;\nfurther off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost\nin the radiance of the sun hanging above it.\n\nAgainst these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other\ncity edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs,\nand rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole\ncontrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities\nof the Gothic erections.  It was somewhat disguised from the road in\npassing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up\nhere.  The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the\nwall of this structure.  From the middle of the building an ugly\nflat-topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and\nviewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it\nseemed the one blot on the city's beauty.  Yet it was with this blot,\nand not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.\n\nUpon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed.  Their eyes\nwere riveted on it.  A few minutes after the hour had struck\nsomething moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the\nbreeze.  It was a black flag.\n\n\"Justice\" was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean\nphrase, had ended his sport with Tess.  And the d'Urberville knights\nand dames slept on in their tombs unknowing.

Tess doesn't want to leave the house, since they're so secluded there from the outside world. Angel agrees to stay another night. Unfortunately, the caretaker of the house comes by to check things out early the next morning, and sees them while they're asleep.

The moon is behind a cloud, and they almost walk into a huge upright stone. After asking themselves where they could possibly be, they feel around and discover that they're in a huge circle of upright stones, some of which have equally huge stones lying crossways above them. It's Stonehenge, they realize. Tess stretches out on one of the horizontal stones, which is still warm from the sun, even though it's dark now. She asks Angel to look after 'Liza-Lu if anything should happen to her. Angel promises. Tess goes further, and asks if he would marry 'Liza-Lu if she should die, which she figures she probably will. Angel objects--he doesn't want Tess to die, and it would be kind of weird to marry his sister-in-law. Eventually, Tess falls asleep, and Angel stays next to her, holding her hand. Just as the sun comes up, Angel realizes that they're surrounded by men coming to arrest Tess. He looks for a weapon, but the man in front tells him it's no use.

In the valley\nbeneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings\nshowing as in an isometric drawing--among them the broad cathedral\ntower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,\nthe spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,\nmore to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice,\nwhere to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.\nBehind the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine's Hill;\nfurther off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost\nin the radiance of the sun hanging above it.\n\nAgainst these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other\ncity edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs,\nand rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole\ncontrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities\nof the Gothic erections.  It was somewhat disguised from the road in\npassing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up\nhere.  The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the\nwall of this structure.  From the middle of the building an ugly\nflat-topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and\nviewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it\nseemed the one blot on the city's beauty.  Yet it was with this blot,\nand not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.\n\nUpon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed.  Their eyes\nwere riveted on it.  A few minutes after the hour had struck\nsomething moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the\nbreeze.  It was a black flag.\n\n\"Justice\" was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean\nphrase, had ended his sport with Tess.  And the d'Urberville knights\nand dames slept on in their tombs unknowing.  The two speechless\ngazers bent themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and\nremained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued\nto wave silently.  As soon as they had strength, they arose, joined\nhands again, and went on.\n\n\n","chapter_length":685.0,"summary_name":"Phase VII: \"Fulfillment,\" Chapter Fifty-Nine","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210424232301\/http:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/tess-of-the-durbervilles\/summary\/chapter-59","summary_text":"Angel and 'Liza-Lu are in the county capitol of Wintoncester, looking completely anguished and walking hand in hand.

Angel decides that they must finally leave the mansion, but Tess wishes to stay, for she believes she will not last more than several weeks. Angel plans to take Tess north, where they can sail from Wessex. They travel northward and reach Stonehenge. Tess wishes to remain there, for Angel used to say that she was a heathen and thus Stonehenge is appropriate for her. Tess asks Angel to look after Liza-Lu if he loses her and to marry her.

Tess doesn't want to leave the house, since they're so secluded there from the outside world. Angel agrees to stay another night.

He leaves his hotel to go to the train station for a return trip home. At the station, Tess finds him and confesses to murdering Alec. Immediately, Angel formulates a plan to walk to the north of England, avoiding the more traveled roads, until they can reach a port city after the events surrounding the murder are forgotten. The two walk for miles, finally happy to be in each other's company. Along the way, they discover a vacant house, with only a caretaker occasionally stopping by. The great house, called Bramshurst Court, is empty of a renter, so the couple takes up residence. They spend five days in the house until the local caretaker sees them sleeping in the large bedrooms. Once discovered, Angel and Tess move directly north until they reach the ancient monoliths of Stonehenge. Tess feels that her freedom is limited and her end is near, so she has Angel promise to marry Liza Lu after her death. Now that it is night and the two are tired, Tess sleeps on one of the \\\"altars\\\" of stone. Near daybreak, the two are surrounded by police who take Tess into custody. For her part, Tess is glad that the end has come, and she goes with the police willingly. In the final chapter, Angel and Liza Lu journey together to Wintoncester to see that Tess' sentence, death by hanging, is carried out. They do not actually witness the deed, but know the enterprise is done when a black flag is hoisted over the town's tower. The two then return the way they came, \\\"As soon as they arose, joined hands again, and went on.\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"Hardy has brought the story full circle. Four years have passed since the day in May, in the beginning of the novel, when Tess and Angel met. At the story's end it is May again. Angel is in the process of leaving Sandbourne when he receives news that his brother, Cuthbert, has become engaged to Mercy Chant. As he is leaving town awaiting the next train, Tess appears with the tale that she had killed Alec. Angel is unsure about her story, but now that she is finally his, he takes no chances of her being discovered. One of their stops takes them to a vacant house, called Bramshurst Court. Their week together is uneventful in that Tess and Angel finally become a married couple. She seems to know that her time with Angel is limited, because she will soon be wanted for Alec's murder; \\\"My life can only be a question of a few weeks,\\\" she says. Her last wishes are for Angel to marry her sister, Liza Lu for \\\"'She had all the best of me without the bad of me.\\\" In Chapter 59, when Angel and Liza Lu join hands after Tess' execution, we understand that Angel will fulfill this request. The chase from Sandbourne ends at the historic site of Stonehenge, a collection of giant stones arranged in a circular form, dating from 2,800 to 1,500 B.C. The purposes for the monuments were to serve as an astrological calendar and a ceremonial place for religious or tribal worship. Because the original purposes of the ancient monuments have been shrouded in mystery, especially in Hardy's time, experts could only speculate as to the purpose of the megaliths. Tess and Angel stop in Stonehenge after they have traveled a long way and need rest. The stones are still warm from the sun, radiating heat all during the cool night. Tess realizes that her mother's family is from the area, \\\"One of my mother's people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of it. And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen. So now I am at home.\\\" Angel recognizes that Tess is \\\"lying on an altar\\\" -- like a sacrifice to the ancient pagans who used to practice there. In a modern sense, Tess is sacrificed to the laws and morals of the nineteenth century. Hardy ends Tess' tale with the words \\\"'Justice' was done, and the President of the Immortals, in the Aeschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.\\\" A bit of background is needed to understand this phrase. First, Aeschylus was an ancient Greek playwright who lived from 525-546 b.c. Aeschylus wrote plays that centered on individual will and the influence of divine power over mortals. In his play called Prometheus Bound, Prometheus is chained to a rock, and an eagle comes to devour his liver every day; each night, Prometheus' liver grows back. Hercules destroys the eagle and sets Prometheus free. Tess is like Prometheus in that she seems to have been a \\\"toy\\\" of the gods of morality and religion in Victorian England, and she had to be sacrificed for the good of mankind. All of Tess' life is the result of either an accident, fate, or the intervention of the gods. In fact, some critics feel that the circumstances leading to Tess' tragic life and death are too contrived, are unrealistic, and unbelievable. Whether realistic or not, Fate has intervened in Tess' world and shaped the course of her life. Glossary \\\"her Antinous . . . \\\" a favorite of the Roman Emperor Hadrian; like Apollo, the Greek god of sun and of music, Antinous was a figure of male beauty.

He went on eating and drinking unconsciously\ntill on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took his\ndressing-bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him,\nand went out.\n\nAt the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him--a few\nwords from his mother, stating that they were glad to know his\naddress, and informing him that his brother Cuthbert had proposed to\nand been accepted by Mercy Chant.\n\nClare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station;\nreaching it, he found that there would be no train leaving for an\nhour and more.  He sat down to wait, and having waited a quarter of\nan hour felt that he could wait there no longer.  Broken in heart and\nnumbed, he had nothing to hurry for; but he wished to get out of a\ntown which had been the scene of such an experience, and turned to\nwalk to the first station onward, and let the train pick him up\nthere.\n\nThe highway that he followed was open, and at a little distance\ndipped into a valley, across which it could be seen running from edge\nto edge.  He had traversed the greater part of this depression, and\nwas climbing the western acclivity when, pausing for breath, he\nunconsciously looked back.  Why he did so he could not say, but\nsomething seemed to impel him to the act.  The tape-like surface of\nthe road diminished in his rear as far as he could see, and as he\ngazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective.\n\nIt was a human figure running.  Clare waited, with a dim sense that\nsomebody was trying to overtake him.\n\nThe form descending the incline was a woman's, yet so entirely was\nhis mind blinded to the idea of his wife's following him that even\nwhen she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally\nchanged attire in which he now beheld her.  It was not till she was\nquite close that he could believe her to be Tess.\n\n\"I saw you--turn away from the station--just before I got there--and\nI have been following you all this way!\"\n\nShe was so pale, so breathless, so quivering in every muscle, that he\ndid not ask her a single question, but seizing her hand, and pulling\nit within his arm, he led her along.  To avoid meeting any possible\nwayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some\nfir-trees.  When they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped\nand looked at her inquiringly.\n\n\"Angel,\" she said, as if waiting for this, \"do you know what I have\nbeen running after you for?  To tell you that I have killed him!\"\nA pitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke.\n\n\"What!\" said he, thinking from the strangeness of her manner that she\nwas in some delirium.\n\n\"I have done it--I don't know how,\" she continued.  \"Still, I owed it\nto you, and to myself, Angel.  I feared long ago, when I struck him\non the mouth with my glove, that I might do it some day for the trap\nhe set for me in my simple youth, and his wrong to you through me.\nHe has come between us and ruined us, and now he can never do it any\nmore.  I never loved him at all, Angel, as I loved you.  You know it,\ndon't you?  You believe it?  You didn't come back to me, and I was\nobliged to go back to him.  Why did you go away--why did you--when I\nloved you so?  I can't think why you did it.  But I don't blame you;\nonly, Angel, will you forgive me my sin against you, now I have\nkilled him?  I thought as I ran along that you would be sure to\nforgive me now I have done that.  It came to me as a shining light\nthat I should get you back that way.  I could not bear the loss of\nyou any longer--you don't know how entirely I was unable to bear your\nnot loving me!  Say you do now, dear, dear husband; say you do, now I\nhave killed him!\"\n\n\"I do love you, Tess--O, I do--it is all come back!\" he said,\ntightening his arms round her with fervid pressure.  \"But how do you\nmean--you have killed him?\"\n\n\"I mean that I have,\" she murmured in a reverie.\n\n\"What, bodily?  Is he dead?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He heard me crying about you, and he bitterly taunted me; and\ncalled you by a foul name; and then I did it.  My heart could not\nbear it.  He had nagged me about you before.  And then I dressed\nmyself and came away to find you.\"\n\nBy degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted,\nat least, what she said she had done; and his horror at her impulse\nwas mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for\nhimself, and at the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently\nextinguished her moral sense altogether.  Unable to realize the\ngravity of her conduct, she seemed at last content; and he looked\nat her as she lay upon his shoulder, weeping with happiness, and\nwondered what obscure strain in the d'Urberville blood had led to\nthis aberration--if it were an aberration.  There momentarily flashed\nthrough his mind that the family tradition of the coach and murder\nmight have arisen because the d'Urbervilles had been known to do\nthese things.  As well as his confused and excited ideas could\nreason, he supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she\nspoke, her mind had lost its balance, and plunged her into this\nabyss.\n\nIt was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad.  But,\nanyhow, here was this deserted wife of his, this passionately-fond\nwoman, clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything\nto her but a protector.  He saw that for him to be otherwise was\nnot, in her mind, within the region of the possible.  Tenderness was\nabsolutely dominant in Clare at last.  He kissed her endlessly with\nhis white lips, and held her hand, and said--\n\n\"I will not desert you!  I will protect you by every means in my\npower, dearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!\"\n\nThey then walked on under the trees, Tess turning her head every now\nand then to look at him.  Worn and unhandsome as he had become, it\nwas plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance.\nTo her he was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and\nmentally.  He was still her Antinous, her Apollo even; his sickly\nface was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on\nthis day no less than when she first beheld him; for was it not the\nface of the one man on earth who had loved her purely, and who had\nbelieved in her as pure!\n\nWith an instinct as to possibilities, he did not now, as he had\nintended, make for the first station beyond the town, but plunged\nstill farther under the firs, which here abounded for miles.  Each\nclasping the other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed\nof fir-needles, thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the\nconsciousness of being together at last, with no living soul between\nthem; ignoring that there was a corpse.  Thus they proceeded for\nseveral miles till Tess, arousing herself, looked about her, and\nsaid, timidly--\n\n\"Are we going anywhere in particular?\"\n\n\"I don't know, dearest.  Why?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, we might walk a few miles further, and when it is evening find\nlodgings somewhere or other--in a lonely cottage, perhaps.  Can you\nwalk well, Tessy?\"\n\n\"O yes!  I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me!\"\n\nUpon the whole it seemed a good thing to do.  Thereupon they\nquickened their pace, avoiding high roads, and following obscure\npaths tending more or less northward.  But there was an unpractical\nvagueness in their movements throughout the day; neither one of them\nseemed to consider any question of effectual escape, disguise, or\nlong concealment.  Their every idea was temporary and unforefending,\nlike the plans of two children.\n\nAt mid-day they drew near to a roadside inn, and Tess would have\nentered it with him to get something to eat, but he persuaded\nher to remain among the trees and bushes of this half-woodland,\nhalf-moorland part of the country till he should come back.  Her\nclothes were of recent fashion; even the ivory-handled parasol that\nshe carried was of a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they\nhad now wandered; and the cut of such articles would have attracted\nattention in the settle of a tavern.  He soon returned, with food\nenough for half-a-dozen people and two bottles of wine--enough to\nlast them for a day or more, should any emergency arise.\n\nThey sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal.  Between\none and two o'clock they packed up the remainder and went on again.\n\n\"I feel strong enough to walk any distance,\" said she.\n\n\"I think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior\nof the country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to\nbe looked for than anywhere near the coast,\" Clare remarked.  \"Later\non, when they have forgotten us, we can make for some port.\"\n\nShe made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly,\nand straight inland they went.  Though the season was an English May,\nthe weather was serenely bright, and during the afternoon it was\nquite warm.  Through the latter miles of their walk their footpath\nhad taken them into the depths of the New Forest, and towards\nevening, turning the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook\nand bridge a large board on which was painted in white letters, \"This\ndesirable Mansion to be Let Furnished\"; particulars following, with\ndirections to apply to some London agents.  Passing through the gate\nthey could see the house, an old brick building of regular design and\nlarge accommodation.\n\n\"I know it,\" said Clare.  \"It is Bramshurst Court.  You can see that\nit is shut up, and grass is growing on the drive.\"\n\n\"Some of the windows are open,\" said Tess.\n\n\"Just to air the rooms, I suppose.\"\n\n\"All these rooms empty, and we without a roof to our heads!\"\n\n\"You are getting tired, my Tess!\" he said.  \"We'll stop soon.\"  And\nkissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwards.\n\nHe was growing weary likewise, for they had wandered a dozen or\nfifteen miles, and it became necessary to consider what they should\ndo for rest.  They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little\ninns, and were inclined to approach one of the latter, when their\nhearts failed them, and they sheered off.  At length their gait\ndragged, and they stood still.\n\n\"Could we sleep under the trees?\" she asked.\n\nHe thought the season insufficiently advanced.\n\n\"I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed,\" he said.\n\"Let us go back towards it again.\"\n\nThey retraced their steps, but it was half an hour before they stood\nwithout the entrance-gate as earlier.  He then requested her to stay\nwhere she was, whilst he went to see who was within.\n\nShe sat down among the bushes within the gate, and Clare crept\ntowards the house.  His absence lasted some considerable time, and\nwhen he returned Tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for\nhim.  He had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in\ncharge as caretaker, and she only came there on fine days, from the\nhamlet near, to open and shut the windows.  She would come to shut\nthem at sunset.  \"Now, we can get in through one of the lower\nwindows, and rest there,\" said he.\n\nUnder his escort she went tardily forward to the main front, whose\nshuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility\nof watchers.  The door was reached a few steps further, and one of\nthe windows beside it was open. Clare clambered in, and pulled Tess\nin after him.\n\nExcept the hall, the rooms were all in darkness, and they ascended\nthe staircase.  Up here also the shutters were tightly closed,\nthe ventilation being perfunctorily done, for this day at least,\nby opening the hall-window in front and an upper window behind.\nClare unlatched the door of a large chamber, felt his way across\nit, and parted the shutters to the width of two or three inches.\nA shaft of dazzling sunlight glanced into the room, revealing heavy,\nold-fashioned furniture, crimson damask hangings, and an enormous\nfour-post bedstead, along the head of which were carved running\nfigures, apparently Atalanta's race.\n\n\"Rest at last!\" said he, setting down his bag and the parcel of\nviands.\n\nThey remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come\nto shut the windows: as a precaution, putting themselves in total\ndarkness by barring the shutters as before, lest the woman should\nopen the door of their chamber for any casual reason.  Between six\nand seven o'clock she came, but did not approach the wing they\nwere in.  They heard her close the windows, fasten them, lock the\ndoor, and go away.  Then Clare again stole a chink of light from\nthe window, and they shared another meal, till by-and-by they\nwere enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to\ndisperse.\n\n\n\n\nThe night was strangely solemn and still.  In the small hours she\nwhispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep\nwith her in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of\nboth their lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined\nabbey.  He had never known of that till now.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me next day?\" he said.  \"It might have prevented\nmuch misunderstanding and woe.\"\n\n\"Don't think of what's past!\" said she.  \"I am not going to think\noutside of now.  Why should we!  Who knows what to-morrow has in\nstore?\"\n\nBut it apparently had no sorrow.  The morning was wet and foggy, and\nClare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows\non fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the\nhouse, leaving Tess asleep.  There was no food on the premises, but\nthere was water, and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the\nmansion and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little\nplace two miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp,\nthat they might get fire without smoke.  His re-entry awoke her; and\nthey breakfasted on what he had brought.\n\nThey were indisposed to stir abroad, and the day passed, and the\nnight following, and the next, and next; till, almost without their\nbeing aware, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a\nsight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such\nas it was.  The changes of the weather were their only events, the\nbirds of the New Forest their only company.  By tacit consent they\nhardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their\nwedding-day.  The gloomy intervening time seemed to sink into chaos,\nover which the present and prior times closed as if it never had\nbeen.  Whenever he suggested that they should leave their shelter,\nand go forwards towards Southampton or London, she showed a strange\nunwillingness to move.\n\n\"Why should we put an end to all that's sweet and lovely!\" she\ndeprecated.  \"What must come will come.\"  And, looking through the\nshutter-chink: \"All is trouble outside there; inside here content.\"\n\nHe peeped out also.  It was quite true; within was affection, union,\nerror forgiven: outside was the inexorable.\n\n\"And--and,\" she said, pressing her cheek against his, \"I fear that\nwhat you think of me now may not last.  I do not wish to outlive your\npresent feeling for me. I would rather not.  I would rather be dead\nand buried when the time comes for you to despise me, so that it may\nnever be known to me that you despised me.\"\n\n\"I cannot ever despise you.\"\n\n\"I also hope that.  But considering what my life has been, I cannot\nsee why any man should, sooner or later, be able to help despising\nme....  How wickedly mad I was!  Yet formerly I never could bear to\nhurt a fly or a worm, and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to\nmake me cry.\"\n\nThey remained yet another day.  In the night the dull sky cleared,\nand the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early.\nThe brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk; she decided to open\nthe contiguous mansion immediately, and to air it thoroughly on such\na day.  Thus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower\nrooms before six o'clock, she ascended to the bedchambers, and was\nabout to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay.  At that moment\nshe fancied she could hear the breathing of persons within.  Her\nslippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one\nso far, and she made for instant retreat; then, deeming that her\nhearing might have deceived her, she turned anew to the door and\nsoftly tried the handle.  The lock was out of order, but a piece of\nfurniture had been moved forward on the inside, which prevented her\nopening the door more than an inch or two.  A stream of morning light\nthrough the shutter-chink fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in\nprofound slumber, Tess's lips being parted like a half-opened flower\nnear his cheek.  The caretaker was so struck with their innocent\nappearance, and with the elegance of Tess's gown hanging across a\nchair, her silk stockings beside it, the pretty parasol, and the\nother habits in which she had arrived because she had none else, that\nher first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave\nway to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it\nseemed.  She closed the door, and withdrew as softly as she had come,\nto go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery.\n\nNot more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when Tess\nwoke, and then Clare.  Both had a sense that something had disturbed\nthem, though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which\nit engendered grew stronger.  As soon as he was dressed he narrowly\nscanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.\n\n\"I think we will leave at once,\" said he.  \"It is a fine day. And I\ncannot help fancying somebody is about the house.  At any rate, the\nwoman will be sure to come to-day.\"\n\nShe passively assented, and putting the room in order, they took up\nthe few articles that belonged to them, and departed noiselessly.\nWhen they had got into the Forest she turned to take a last look at\nthe house.\n\n\"Ah, happy house--goodbye!\" she said.  \"My life can only be a\nquestion of a few weeks.  Why should we not have stayed there?\"\n\n\"Don't say it, Tess!  We shall soon get out of this district\naltogether.  We'll continue our course as we've begun it, and keep\nstraight north.  Nobody will think of looking for us there.  We shall\nbe looked for at the Wessex ports if we are sought at all.  When we\nare in the north we will get to a port and away.\"\n\nHaving thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued, and they kept a\nbee-line northward.  Their long repose at the manor-house lent them\nwalking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were\napproaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in\ntheir way.  He decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the\nafternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness.  At dusk Clare\npurchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary\nbetween Upper and Mid-Wessex being crossed about eight o'clock.\n\nTo walk across country without much regard to roads was not new\nto Tess, and she showed her old agility in the performance.  The\nintercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged to pass\nthrough in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a\nlarge river that obstructed them.  It was about midnight when they\nwent along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps,\nkeeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps.\nThe graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left\nhand, but it was lost upon them now.  Once out of the town they\nfollowed the turnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an\nopen plain.\n\nThough the sky was dense with cloud, a diffused light from some\nfragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little.  But the moon\nhad now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and\nthe night grew as dark as a cave.  However, they found their way\nalong, keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might\nnot resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence\nof any kind.  All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over\nwhich a stiff breeze blew.\n\nThey had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when\non a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in\nhis front, rising sheer from the grass.  They had almost struck\nthemselves against it.\n\n\"What monstrous place is this?\" said Angel.\n\n\"It hums,\" said she.  \"Hearken!\"\n\nHe listened.  The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming\ntune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp.  No other\nsound came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or\ntwo, Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure.  It seemed to\nbe of solid stone, without joint or moulding.  Carrying his fingers\nonward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal\nrectangular pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a\nsimilar one adjoining.  At an indefinite height overhead something\nmade the black sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast\narchitrave uniting the pillars horizontally.  They carefully entered\nbeneath and between; the surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they\nseemed to be still out of doors.  The place was roofless.  Tess drew\nher breath fearfully, and Angel, perplexed, said--\n\n\"What can it be?\"\n\nFeeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square\nand uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another.  The\nplace was all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous\narchitraves.\n\n\"A very Temple of the Winds,\" he said.\n\nThe next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others\nwere prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a\ncarriage; and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of\nmonoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain.  The couple\nadvanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in\nits midst.\n\n\"It is Stonehenge!\" said Clare.\n\n\"The heathen temple, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Older than the centuries; older than the d'Urbervilles!  Well,\nwhat shall we do, darling?  We may find shelter further on.\"\n\nBut Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong\nslab that lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a\npillar.  Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the\nstone was warm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill\ngrass around, which had damped her skirts and shoes.\n\n\"I don't want to go any further, Angel,\" she said, stretching out her\nhand for his.  \"Can't we bide here?\"\n\n\"I fear not.  This spot is visible for miles by day, although it does\nnot seem so now.\"\n\n\"One of my mother's people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of\nit.  And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen.  So now\nI am at home.\"\n\nHe knelt down beside her outstretched form, and put his lips upon\nhers.\n\n\"Sleepy are you, dear?  I think you are lying on an altar.\"\n\n\"I like very much to be here,\" she murmured.  \"It is so solemn and\nlonely--after my great happiness--with nothing but the sky above my\nface.  It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two;\nand I wish there were not--except 'Liza-Lu.\"\n\nClare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little\nlighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her\nside.\n\n\"Angel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over 'Liza-Lu for\nmy sake?\" she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind\namong the pillars.\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"She is so good and simple and pure.  O, Angel--I wish you would\nmarry her if you lose me, as you will do shortly.  O, if you would!\"\n\n\"If I lose you I lose all!  And she is my sister-in-law.\"\n\n\"That's nothing, dearest.  People marry sister-laws continually about\nMarlott; and 'Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing\nso beautiful.  O, I could share you with her willingly when we are\nspirits!  If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her\nup for your own self! ...  She had all the best of me without the bad\nof me; and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if\ndeath had not divided us...  Well, I have said it.  I won't mention\nit again.\"\n\nShe ceased, and he fell into thought.  In the far north-east sky he\ncould see between the pillars a level streak of light.  The uniform\nconcavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot,\nletting in at the earth's edge the coming day, against which the\ntowering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.\n\n\"Did they sacrifice to God here?\" asked she.\n\n\"No,\" said he.\n\n\"Who to?\"\n\n\"I believe to the sun.  That lofty stone set away by itself is in the\ndirection of the sun, which will presently rise behind it.\"\n\n\"This reminds me, dear,\" she said.  \"You remember you never would\ninterfere with any belief of mine before we were married?  But I knew\nyour mind all the same, and I thought as you thought--not from any\nreasons of my own, but because you thought so.  Tell me now, Angel,\ndo you think we shall meet again after we are dead?  I want to know.\"\n\nHe kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time.\n\n\"O, Angel--I fear that means no!\" said she, with a suppressed sob.\n\"And I wanted so to see you again--so much, so much!  What--not even\nyou and I, Angel, who love each other so well?\"\n\nLike a greater than himself, to the critical question at the critical\ntime he did not answer; and they were again silent.  In a minute or\ntwo her breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed,\nand she fell asleep.  The band of silver paleness along the east\nhorizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark\nand near; and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of\nreserve, taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day.\nThe eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against\nthe light, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the\nStone of Sacrifice midway.  Presently the night wind died out, and\nthe quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay\nstill.  At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the\ndip eastward--a mere dot.  It was the head of a man approaching them\nfrom the hollow beyond the Sun-stone.  Clare wished they had gone\nonward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet.  The figure\ncame straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.\n\nHe heard something behind him, the brush of feet.  Turning, he saw\nover the prostrate columns another figure; then before he was aware,\nanother was at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on\nthe left.  The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and\nClare could discern from this that he was tall, and walked as if\ntrained.  They all closed in with evident purpose.  Her story then\nwas true!  Springing to his feet, he looked around for a weapon,\nloose stone, means of escape, anything.  By this time the nearest\nman was upon him.\n\n\"It is no use, sir,\" he said.  \"There are sixteen of us on the Plain,\nand the whole country is reared.\"\n\n\"Let her finish her sleep!\" he implored in a whisper of the men as\nthey gathered round.\n\nWhen they saw where she lay, which they had not done till then, they\nshowed no objection, and stood watching her, as still as the pillars\naround.  He went to the stone and bent over her, holding one poor\nlittle hand; her breathing now was quick and small, like that of a\nlesser creature than a woman.  All waited in the growing light, their\nfaces and hands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their\nfigures dark, the stones glistening green-gray, the Plain still a\nmass of shade.  Soon the light was strong, and a ray shone upon her\nunconscious form, peering under her eyelids and waking her.\n\n\"What is it, Angel?\" she said, starting up.  \"Have they come for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest,\" he said.  \"They have come.\"\n\n\"It is as it should be,\" she murmured.  \"Angel, I am almost glad--yes,\nglad!  This happiness could not have lasted.  It was too much.  I\nhave had enough; and now I shall not live for you to despise me!\"\n\nShe stood up, shook herself, and went forward, neither of the men\nhaving moved.\n\n\"I am ready,\" she said quietly.\n\n\n\n\nThe city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital\nof Wessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the\nbrightness and warmth of a July morning.  The gabled brick, tile, and\nfreestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument\nof lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping\nHigh Street, from the West Gateway to the mediaeval cross, and from\nthe mediaeval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping\nwas in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.\n\nFrom the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian\nknows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a\nmeasured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind.  Up this road\nfrom the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly,\nas if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through\npreoccupation and not through buoyancy.  They had emerged upon this\nroad through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower\ndown.  They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and\nof their kind, and this road appeared to offer the quickest means\nof doing so.  Though they were young, they walked with bowed heads,\nwhich gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.\n\nOne of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding\ncreature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of Tess,\nslighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes--Clare's\nsister-in-law, 'Liza-Lu.  Their pale faces seemed to have shrunk\nto half their natural size.  They moved on hand in hand, and never\nspoke a word, the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's\n\"Two Apostles\".\n\nWhen they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the\nclocks in the town struck eight.  Each gave a start at the notes,\nand, walking onward yet a few steps, they reached the first\nmilestone, standing whitely on the green margin of the grass, and\nbacked by the down, which here was open to the road.  They entered\nupon the turf, and, impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their\nwill, suddenly stood still, turned, and waited in paralyzed suspense\nbeside the stone.\n\nThe prospect from this summit was almost unlimited.  In the valley\nbeneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings\nshowing as in an isometric drawing--among them the broad cathedral\ntower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,\nthe spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,\nmore to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice,\nwhere to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.\nBehind the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine's Hill;\nfurther off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost\nin the radiance of the sun hanging above it.\n\nAgainst these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other\ncity edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs,\nand rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole\ncontrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities\nof the Gothic erections.  It was somewhat disguised from the road in\npassing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up\nhere.  The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the\nwall of this structure.  From the middle of the building an ugly\nflat-topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and\nviewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it\nseemed the one blot on the city's beauty.  Yet it was with this blot,\nand not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.\n\nUpon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed.  Their eyes\nwere riveted on it.  A few minutes after the hour had struck\nsomething moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the\nbreeze.  It was a black flag.\n\n\"Justice\" was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean\nphrase, had ended his sport with Tess.  And the d'Urberville knights\nand dames slept on in their tombs unknowing.  The two speechless\ngazers bent themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and\nremained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued\nto wave silently.  As soon as they had strength, they arose, joined\nhands again, and went on.\n\n\n","chapter_length":5475.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 57-59","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201219151046\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/t\/tess-of-the-durbervilles\/summary-and-analysis\/phase-the-seventh-fulfilment-chapters-5759","summary_text":"Angel hears from his parents via telegram that his brother Cuthbert is engaged to Mercy Chant.

Four years have passed since the day in May, in the beginning of the novel, when Tess and Angel met. At the story's end it is May again. Angel is in the process of leaving Sandbourne when he receives news that his brother, Cuthbert, has become engaged to Mercy Chant. As he is leaving town awaiting the next train, Tess appears with the tale that she had killed Alec. Angel is unsure about her story, but now that she is finally his, he takes no chances of her being discovered. One of their stops takes them to a vacant house, called Bramshurst Court. Their week together is uneventful in that Tess and Angel finally become a married couple. She seems to know that her time with Angel is limited, because she will soon be wanted for Alec's murder; \"My life can only be a question of a few weeks,\" she says. Her last wishes are for Angel to marry her sister, Liza Lu for \"'She had all the best of me without the bad of me.\" In Chapter 59, when Angel and Liza Lu join hands after Tess' execution, we understand that Angel will fulfill this request. The chase from Sandbourne ends at the historic site of Stonehenge, a collection of giant stones arranged in a circular form, dating from 2,800 to 1,500 B.C. The purposes for the monuments were to serve as an astrological calendar and a ceremonial place for religious or tribal worship. Because the original purposes of the ancient monuments have been shrouded in mystery, especially in Hardy's time, experts could only speculate as to the purpose of the megaliths. Tess and Angel stop in Stonehenge after they have traveled a long way and need rest. The stones are still warm from the sun, radiating heat all during the cool night. Tess realizes that her mother's family is from the area, \"One of my mother's people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of it. And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen. So now I am at home.\" Angel recognizes that Tess is \"lying on an altar\" -- like a sacrifice to the ancient pagans who used to practice there. In a modern sense, Tess is sacrificed to the laws and morals of the nineteenth century. Hardy ends Tess' tale with the words \"'Justice' was done, and the President of the Immortals, in the Aeschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.\" A bit of background is needed to understand this phrase. First, Aeschylus was an ancient Greek playwright who lived from 525-546 b.c. Aeschylus wrote plays that centered on individual will and the influence of divine power over mortals. In his play called Prometheus Bound, Prometheus is chained to a rock, and an eagle comes to devour his liver every day; each night, Prometheus' liver grows back. Hercules destroys the eagle and sets Prometheus free. Tess is like Prometheus in that she seems to have been a \"toy\" of the gods of morality and religion in Victorian England, and she had to be sacrificed for the good of mankind. All of Tess' life is the result of either an accident, fate, or the intervention of the gods. In fact, some critics feel that the circumstances leading to Tess' tragic life and death are too contrived, are unrealistic, and unbelievable. Whether realistic or not, Fate has intervened in Tess' world and shaped the course of her life.

Angel plans to take Tess north, where they can sail from Wessex. They travel northward and reach Stonehenge.

The lack of description surrounding the event is a clear statement by Hardy; Tess's death seems small in comparison to the sufferings she has undergone in life, all as a result of Alec's lust. Hardy, therefore, implies the tragedy of the law; while it punishes physical acts of violence, such as murder, it does nothing to punish the perpetrator of emotional violence, who also destroys life. The final words of the novel \\\"justice was done\\\" are spoken by the author in bitter irony. It is an intense statement about the tragedy of Tess Durbeyfield Clare.

It is a brief chapter and no details of her death are given. Angel and Liza Lu simply watch the black flag rising. The lack of description surrounding the event is a clear statement by Hardy; Tess's death seems small in comparison to the sufferings she has undergone in life, all as a result of Alec's lust. Hardy, therefore, implies the tragedy of the law; while it punishes physical acts of violence, such as murder, it does nothing to punish the perpetrator of emotional violence, who also destroys life. The final words of the novel \"justice was done\" are spoken by the author in bitter irony. It is an intense statement about the tragedy of Tess Durbeyfield Clare.

They had emerged upon this\nroad through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower\ndown.

Though they were young, they walked with bowed heads,\nwhich gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.\n\nOne of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding\ncreature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of Tess,\nslighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes--Clare's\nsister-in-law, 'Liza-Lu.

It was out of the question to\nstop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two important\npersonages shed tears. The President submitted, and even postponed ringing\nhis bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppression\nof something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself\nwas genuinely touched.\n\nAnd it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make certain\nobjections. People looked at him with hatred. \"What? What's the meaning of\nit? He positively dares to make objections,\" the ladies babbled. But if\nthe whole world of ladies, including his wife, had protested he could not\nhave been stopped at that moment. He was pale, he was shaking with\nemotion, his first phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath,\ncould hardly speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered\nhimself. Of this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.\n\n\"... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this defense\nif not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking was poetry.\nFyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his mistress, tears open the envelope\nand throws it on the floor. We are even told what he said while engaged in\nthis strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we\nthat he had taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded\nidiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society for\nhis illegitimate birth--isn't this a romance in the Byronic style? And the\nson who breaks into his father's house and murders him without murdering\nhim is not even a romance--this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he\ncannot solve himself. If he murdered him, he murdered him, and what's the\nmeaning of his murdering him without having murdered him--who can make head\nor tail of this?\n\n\"Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound\nideas and from this tribune of 'sound ideas' is heard a solemn declaration\nthat to call the murder of a father 'parricide' is nothing but a\nprejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is to ask\nhis father why he is to love him, what will become of us? What will become\nof the foundations of society? What will become of the family? Parricide,\nit appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchants' wives. The most precious,\nthe most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justice\nare presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an\nobject--to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified.\n'Oh, crush him by mercy,' cries the counsel for the defense; but that's\nall the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he is\ncrushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking only\nfor the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor of\nthe parricide to commemorate his exploit among future generations?\nReligion and the Gospel are corrected--that's all mysticism, we are told,\nand ours is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to the\nanalysis of reason and common sense. And so they set up before us a false\nsemblance of Christ! 'What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you\nagain,' cried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that\nChrist teaches us to measure as it is measured to us--and this from the\ntribune of truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve\nof making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance\nwith what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of use\nto produce a certain effect--all to serve the purpose! But what Christ\ncommands us is something very different: He bids us beware of doing this,\nbecause the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive and to turn\nthe other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure to\nus. This is what our God has taught us and not that to forbid children to\nmurder their fathers is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune of\ntruth and good sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for\nthe defense deigns to call only 'the crucified lover of humanity,' in\nopposition to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, 'For Thou art our\nGod!' \"\n\nAt this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous speaker,\nbegging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on, as\npresidents always do in such cases. The audience, too, was uneasy. The\npublic was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.\nFetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only mounted the tribune to lay\nhis hand on his heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few words full\nof dignity. He only touched again, lightly and ironically, on \"romancing\"\nand \"psychology,\" and in an appropriate place quoted, \"Jupiter, you are\nangry, therefore you are wrong,\" which provoked a burst of approving\nlaughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like\nJupiter. Then, _a propos_ of the accusation that he was teaching the young\ngeneration to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with great\ndignity, that he would not even answer. As for the prosecutor's charge of\nuttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal\ninsinuation and that he had expected in this court to be secure from\naccusations \"damaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.\"\nBut at these words the President pulled him up, too, and Fetyukovitch\nconcluded his speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court.\nAnd Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, \"crushed for\ngood.\"\n\nThen the prisoner was allowed to speak. Mitya stood up, but said very\nlittle. He was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally. The look of\nstrength and independence with which he had entered in the morning had\nalmost disappeared. He seemed as though he had passed through an\nexperience that day, which had taught him for the rest of his life\nsomething very important he had not understood till then. His voice was\nweak, he did not shout as before. In his words there was a new note of\nhumility, defeat and submission.\n\n\"What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment has come\nfor me, I feel the hand of God upon me! The end has come to an erring man!\nBut, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent of my father's blood! For\nthe last time I repeat, it wasn't I killed him! I was erring, but I loved\nwhat is good. Every instant I strove to reform, but I lived like a wild\nbeast. I thank the prosecutor, he told me many things about myself that I\ndid not know; but it's not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is\nmistaken. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him; but it's not\ntrue that I killed my father, and he needn't have supposed it. And don't\nbelieve the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my heart is heavy. If you\nspare me, if you let me go, I will pray for you. I will be a better man. I\ngive you my word before God I will! And if you will condemn me, I'll break\nmy sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob\nme of my God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen\n... spare me!\"\n\nHe almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly\narticulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the questions\nand began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.\n\nBut I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for\nconsultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to the\njury was rather feeble. \"Be impartial, don't be influenced by the\neloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there\nis a great responsibility laid upon you,\" and so on and so on.\n\nThe jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move\nabout, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the\nbuffet. It was very late, almost one o'clock in the night, but nobody went\naway: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. All\nwaited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for\nthe ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts\nwere untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all\nprepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must\nown there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an\nacquittal was inevitable. Some were pleased, others frowned, while some\nwere simply dejected, not wanting him to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch\nhimself was confident of his success. He was surrounded by people\ncongratulating him and fawning upon him.\n\n\"There are,\" he said to one group, as I was told afterwards, \"there are\ninvisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury. One\nfeels during one's speech if they are being formed. I was aware of them.\nThey exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind at rest.\"\n\n\"What will our peasants say now?\" said one stout, cross-looking, pock-\nmarked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching a group of\ngentlemen engaged in conversation.\n\n\"But they are not all peasants. There are four government clerks among\nthem.\"\n\n\"Yes, there are clerks,\" said a member of the district council, joining\nthe group.\n\n\"And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a juryman?\"\n\n\"What of him?\"\n\n\"He is a man with brains.\"\n\n\"But he never speaks.\"\n\n\"He is no great talker, but so much the better. There's no need for the\nPetersburg man to teach him: he could teach all Petersburg himself. He's\nthe father of twelve children. Think of that!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, you don't suppose they won't acquit him?\" one of our young\nofficials exclaimed in another group.\n\n\"They'll acquit him for certain,\" said a resolute voice.\n\n\"It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him!\" cried the\nofficial. \"Suppose he did murder him--there are fathers and fathers! And,\nbesides, he was in such a frenzy.... He really may have done nothing but\nswing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old man down. But it was a\npity they dragged the valet in. That was simply an absurd theory! If I'd\nbeen in Fetyukovitch's place, I should simply have said straight out: 'He\nmurdered him; but he is not guilty, hang it all!' \"\n\n\"That's what he did, only without saying, 'Hang it all!' \"\n\n\"No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he almost said that, too,\" put in a third voice.\n\n\"Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cut\nthe throat of her lover's lawful wife.\"\n\n\"Oh, but she did not finish cutting it.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference. She began cutting it.\"\n\n\"What did you think of what he said about children? Splendid, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Splendid!\"\n\n\"And about mysticism, too!\"\n\n\"Oh, drop mysticism, do!\" cried some one else; \"think of Ippolit and his\nfate from this day forth. His wife will scratch his eyes out to-morrow for\nMitya's sake.\"\n\n\"Is she here?\"\n\n\"What an idea! If she'd been here she'd have scratched them out in court.\nShe is at home with toothache. He he he!\"\n\n\"He he he!\"\n\nIn a third group:\n\n\"I dare say they will acquit Mitenka, after all.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised if he turns the 'Metropolis' upside down to-\nmorrow. He will be drinking for ten days!\"\n\n\"Oh, the devil!\"\n\n\"The devil's bound to have a hand in it. Where should he be if not here?\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I admit it was eloquent. But still it's not the thing to\nbreak your father's head with a pestle! Or what are we coming to?\"\n\n\"The chariot! Do you remember the chariot?\"\n\n\"Yes; he turned a cart into a chariot!\"\n\n\"And to-morrow he will turn a chariot into a cart, just to suit his\npurpose.\"\n\n\"What cunning chaps there are nowadays! Is there any justice to be had in\nRussia?\"\n\nBut the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour, neither more\nnor less. A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the public\nhad taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen walked into the court.\nAt last! I won't repeat the questions in order, and, indeed, I have\nforgotten them. I remember only the answer to the President's first and\nchief question: \"Did the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of\nrobbery and with premeditation?\" (I don't remember the exact words.) There\nwas a complete hush. The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks,\npronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness of the\ncourt:\n\n\"Yes, guilty!\"\n\nAnd the same answer was repeated to every question: \"Yes, guilty!\" and\nwithout the slightest extenuating comment. This no one had expected;\nalmost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.\nThe deathlike silence in the court was not broken--all seemed petrified:\nthose who desired his conviction as well as those who had been eager for\nhis acquittal. But that was only for the first instant, and it was\nfollowed by a fearful hubbub. Many of the men in the audience were\npleased. Some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their\njoy. Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged their\nshoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this. But how\nshall I describe the state the ladies were in? I thought they would create\na riot. At first they could scarcely believe their ears. Then suddenly the\nwhole court rang with exclamations: \"What's the meaning of it? What next?\"\nThey leapt up from their places. They seemed to fancy that it might be at\nonce reconsidered and reversed. At that instant Mitya suddenly stood up\nand cried in a heartrending voice, stretching his hands out before him:\n\n\"I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment I am not guilty of my\nfather's blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have pity on the\nother woman!\"\n\nHe could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was heard\nall over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his own. From the\nfarthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing shriek--it was\nGrushenka. She had succeeded in begging admittance to the court again\nbefore the beginning of the lawyers' speeches. Mitya was taken away. The\npassing of the sentence was deferred till next day. The whole court was in\na hubbub but I did not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations I\nheard on the steps as I went out.\n\n\"He'll have a twenty years' trip to the mines!\"\n\n\"Not less.\"\n\n\"Well, our peasants have stood firm.\"\n\n\"And have done for our Mitya.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":2354.0,"summary_name":"Book 12, Chapter 14","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201023112808\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/brothers-karamazov\/summary\/book-12-chapter-14","summary_text":"The end of Fetyukovich's speech is greeted with loud applause from the courtroom.

The Peasants Stand Firm\n\n\nThis was how Fetyukovitch concluded his speech, and the enthusiasm of the\naudience burst like an irresistible storm. It was out of the question to\nstop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two important\npersonages shed tears. The President submitted, and even postponed ringing\nhis bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppression\nof something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards. The orator himself\nwas genuinely touched.\n\nAnd it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make certain\nobjections. People looked at him with hatred. \"What? What's the meaning of\nit? He positively dares to make objections,\" the ladies babbled. But if\nthe whole world of ladies, including his wife, had protested he could not\nhave been stopped at that moment. He was pale, he was shaking with\nemotion, his first phrases were even unintelligible, he gasped for breath,\ncould hardly speak clearly, lost the thread. But he soon recovered\nhimself. Of this new speech of his I will quote only a few sentences.\n\n\"... I am reproached with having woven a romance. But what is this defense\nif not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking was poetry.\nFyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his mistress, tears open the envelope\nand throws it on the floor. We are even told what he said while engaged in\nthis strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we\nthat he had taken out the money? Who heard what he said? The weak-minded\nidiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society for\nhis illegitimate birth--isn't this a romance in the Byronic style? And the\nson who breaks into his father's house and murders him without murdering\nhim is not even a romance--this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he\ncannot solve himself. If he murdered him, he murdered him, and what's the\nmeaning of his murdering him without having murdered him--who can make head\nor tail of this?\n\n\"Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound\nideas and from this tribune of 'sound ideas' is heard a solemn declaration\nthat to call the murder of a father 'parricide' is nothing but a\nprejudice! But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is to ask\nhis father why he is to love him, what will become of us? What will become\nof the foundations of society? What will become of the family? Parricide,\nit appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchants' wives. The most precious,\nthe most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justice\nare presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an\nobject--to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified.\n'Oh, crush him by mercy,' cries the counsel for the defense; but that's\nall the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he is\ncrushed. And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking only\nfor the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor of\nthe parricide to commemorate his exploit among future generations?\nReligion and the Gospel are corrected--that's all mysticism, we are told,\nand ours is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to the\nanalysis of reason and common sense. And so they set up before us a false\nsemblance of Christ! 'What measure ye mete so it shall be meted unto you\nagain,' cried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that\nChrist teaches us to measure as it is measured to us--and this from the\ntribune of truth and sound sense! We peep into the Gospel only on the eve\nof making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance\nwith what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of use\nto produce a certain effect--all to serve the purpose! But what Christ\ncommands us is something very different: He bids us beware of doing this,\nbecause the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive and to turn\nthe other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure to\nus. This is what our God has taught us and not that to forbid children to\nmurder their fathers is a prejudice. And we will not from the tribune of\ntruth and good sense correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for\nthe defense deigns to call only 'the crucified lover of humanity,' in\nopposition to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him, 'For Thou art our\nGod!' \"\n\nAt this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous speaker,\nbegging him not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on, as\npresidents always do in such cases. The audience, too, was uneasy. The\npublic was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.\nFetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he only mounted the tribune to lay\nhis hand on his heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few words full\nof dignity. He only touched again, lightly and ironically, on \"romancing\"\nand \"psychology,\" and in an appropriate place quoted, \"Jupiter, you are\nangry, therefore you are wrong,\" which provoked a burst of approving\nlaughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like\nJupiter.

Eighteen years and eighteen chapters later, Dorian decides to do precisely what he had prevented from happening, and once again his body throws itself before the painting, subject to the dangers of its beauty.\"}","chapter":"\nIt was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and\ndid not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled home,\nsmoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.  He\nheard one of them whisper to the other, \"That is Dorian Gray.\" He\nremembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared\nat, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing his own name now.  Half\nthe charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was\nthat no one knew who he was.  He had often told the girl whom he had\nlured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.  He had\ntold her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and\nanswered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.  What a\nlaugh she had!--just like a thrush singing.  And how pretty she had\nbeen in her cotton dresses and her large hats!  She knew nothing, but\nshe had everything that he had lost.\n\nWhen he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He sent\nhim to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and\nbegan to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\n\nWas it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild longing\nfor the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as\nLord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had tarnished himself,\nfilled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he\nhad been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible\njoy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had\nbeen the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to\nshame.  But was it all irretrievable?  Was there no hope for him?\n\nAh! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that\nthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the\nunsullied splendour of eternal youth!  All his failure had been due to\nthat.  Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure\nswift penalty along with it.  There was purification in punishment.\nNot \"Forgive us our sins\" but \"Smite us for our iniquities\" should be\nthe prayer of man to a most just God.\n\nThe curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many\nyears ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids\nlaughed round it as of old.  He took it up, as he had done on that\nnight of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal\npicture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished\nshield.  Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a\nmad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: \"The world is changed\nbecause you are made of ivory and gold.  The curves of your lips\nrewrite history.\"  The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated\nthem over and over to himself.  Then he loathed his own beauty, and\nflinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters\nbeneath his heel.  It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty\nand the youth that he had prayed for.  But for those two things, his\nlife might have been free from stain.  His beauty had been to him but a\nmask, his youth but a mockery.  What was youth at best?  A green, an\nunripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.  Why had he\nworn its livery?  Youth had spoiled him.\n\nIt was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.  It\nwas of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  James\nVane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.  Alan Campbell\nhad shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the\nsecret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement, such as it\nwas, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.  It was\nalready waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor, indeed, was it the\ndeath of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.  It was the\nliving death of his own soul that troubled him.  Basil had painted the\nportrait that had marred his life.  He could not forgive him that.  It\nwas the portrait that had done everything.  Basil had said things to\nhim that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.  The\nmurder had been simply the madness of a moment.  As for Alan Campbell,\nhis suicide had been his own act.  He had chosen to do it.  It was\nnothing to him.\n\nA new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting\nfor.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent\nthing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would be\ngood.\n\nAs he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\nthe locked room had changed.  Surely it was not still so horrible as it\nhad been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\nevery sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of evil\nhad already gone away.  He would go and look.\n\nHe took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.  As he unbarred the\ndoor, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\nand lingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and\nthe hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\nto him.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\n\nHe went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\ndragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and\nindignation broke from him.  He could see no change, save that in the\neyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\nthe hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if\npossible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\nbrighter, and more like blood newly spilled.  Then he trembled.  Had it\nbeen merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or the\ndesire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\nlaugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\nfiner than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?  And why was the\nred stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have crept like a\nhorrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was blood on the\npainted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand\nthat had not held the knife.  Confess?  Did it mean that he was to\nconfess?  To give himself up and be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt\nthat the idea was monstrous.  Besides, even if he did confess, who\nwould believe him?  There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\nEverything belonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned\nwhat had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\nThey would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was\nhis duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public\natonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to\nearth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would cleanse him\ntill he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his shoulders.\nThe death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.  He was thinking\nof Hetty Merton.  For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul\nthat he was looking at.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there\nbeen nothing more in his renunciation than that?  There had been\nsomething more.  At least he thought so.  But who could tell? ... No.\nThere had been nothing more.  Through vanity he had spared her.  In\nhypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.  For curiosity's sake he\nhad tried the denial of self.  He recognized that now.\n\nBut this murder--was it to dog him all his life?  Was he always to be\nburdened by his past?  Was he really to confess?  Never.  There was\nonly one bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself--that\nwas evidence.  He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  Once\nit had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.  Of\nlate he had felt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night.\nWhen he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes\nshould look upon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions.\nIts mere memory had marred many moments of joy.  It had been like\nconscience to him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.\n\nHe looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.  He\nhad cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.  It\nwas bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it would\nkill the painter's work, and all that that meant.  It would kill the\npast, and when that was dead, he would be free.  It would kill this\nmonstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at\npeace.  He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\n\nThere was a cry heard, and a crash.  The cry was so horrible in its\nagony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\nTwo gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\nup at the great house.  They walked on till they met a policeman and\nbrought him back.  The man rang the bell several times, but there was\nno answer.  Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was\nall dark.  After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico\nand watched.\n\n\"Whose house is that, Constable?\" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\n\n\"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,\" answered the policeman.\n\nThey looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.  One of\nthem was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.\n\nInside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics\nwere talking in low whispers to each other.  Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\nand wringing her hands.  Francis was as pale as death.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\nfootmen and crept upstairs.  They knocked, but there was no reply.\nThey called out.  Everything was still.  Finally, after vainly trying\nto force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the\nbalcony.  The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old.\n\nWhen they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\nof their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\nexquisite youth and beauty.  Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\nevening dress, with a knife in his heart.  He was withered, wrinkled,\nand loathsome of visage.  It was not till they had examined the rings\nthat they recognized who it was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":1897.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 20","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210421171214\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-picture-of-dorian-gray\/study-guide\/summary-chapter-20","summary_text":"During the walk home from Henry's, Dorian enjoys the warm evening.

Dorian, it seems, has decided to change his ways. Henry tells him that he is perfect the way he is and that there's no use trying to change, but Dorian replies that \"I have done too many dreadful things in my life,\" and that \"I began my good actions yesterday.\" His so-called \"good action\" was his treatment of Hetty, a beautiful young peasant girl who reminded him of Sibyl Vane. She fell in love with Dorian, but instead of taking advantage of her and breaking her heart, as was his usual way, he \"determined to leave her as flower-like as had found her.\" Henry mocks him and asks whether he's sure that Hetty \"isn't floating at the present moment in some star-lit millpond...like Ophelia.\" This upsets Dorian, as he desperately wants to believe in the value of his good intentions. The conversation turns towards the whereabouts of Basil Hallward. The painter's disappearance, now six weeks old, is still the talk of the town, along with Henry's divorce and the suicide of Alan Campbell. Henry asks Dorian to play Chopin for him, because \"The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.\" At the piano, Dorian nonchalantly asks what Henry would think if he told him that he had murdered Basil. \"I would say,\" he responds, \"that you were posing for a character that didn't suit you.\" Such crimes, Henry believes, are the specialty of the lower classes. Besides, Henry cannot imagine that Basil would have met such a romantic end, because his paintings had steadily declined in the years following his soiled friendship with Dorian. His painting of Dorian was, apparently, his final masterpiece. Henry believes that the painting was stolen a long time ago, and Dorian claims to have forgotten all about it. Henry catches Dorian off-guard by paraphrasing the Bible, asking him: \"what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose...his soul?\" When Dorian is startled by this statement, Henry just laughs, telling him that he heard a preacher posing this quesiton to a crowd during a walk through the park on a rainy day. Henry describes his amusement at the spectacle of the somber crowd standing in the rain, listening to \"an uncouth Christian in a macintosh.\" He apparently wanted to tell the preacher that \"Art had a soul, but that man did not.\" Henry's light-heartedness offends Dorian, who says that \"The soul is a terrible reality...It can be poisoned or made perfect.\" He tells Henry that he is certain of this fact, to which Henry replies, \"then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true.\" Dorian begins to play a nocturne by Chopin, which greatly affects Henry and prompts a rambling tirade on romance and how exquisite Dorian's life has been. Dorian agrees, but reminds Henry that he has turned over a new leaf, and that he will never forgive him for his corrupting influence. On his way out, Henry invites Dorian to lunch the next day, and Dorian reluctantly agrees to accompany the older man.","This whole James Vane incident seems to have shaken Dorian significantly. Back in London, he informs Lord Henry that he's going to become a good person again. Henry doesn't believe it, nor does he think Dorian should change at all. In his view, his friend is perfect. For about the thousandth time, we think about how warped Lord Henry is. Apparently, the day before, Dorian was staying out in the countryside by himself, and Henry comments that it's a lot easier to be good out there, since there's nothing to do. Dorian continues, saying that he's altered . Lord Henry demands to know what Dorian's done that's so great. Dorian tells Henry about a young girl that he met and fell in love with in the countryside. She reminded him of Sibyl Vane, and she totally fell for him. However, instead of corrupting her and destroying her life, he decided to let her go--he leaves her in her innocent state. Dorian thinks this good deed is enough to set him on the path to righteousness, despite Henry's doubts. Lord Henry continues to mock Dorian's fantasies. Dorian abruptly changes the subject, and asks Henry what's going on around town. Apparently, the gossip around their club is all about Basil--people are still discussing his disappearance. We also hear in passing that Alan Campbell committed suicide . Dorian plays it cool, and asks Henry what he thinks happened to Basil; Lord Henry's basically like, \"Screw Basil! Listen to me talk about my life.\" But Dorian doesn't want to let it go. He asks Henry if he's ever wondered if Basil was murdered--or, for that matter, if anyone else thinks that. Henry's just not that concerned; besides, he doesn't think Basil was interesting enough to get himself murdered. Dorian asks an interesting hypothetical question: what would Henry think if he said that he had killed Basil? Henry basically laughs this off, too, saying that crime is for the lower classes. He honestly just doesn't care, and even jokes that Basil probably drowned in the river Seine. Since Basil's paintings haven't been that great lately, Henry doesn't think there's anything to be sad about. Henry brings up the portrait, which he identifies as one of Basil's great works. Apparently Dorian told him that it was either lost or stolen. They discuss the painting a bit more, and Dorian confesses that he never liked it . Lord Henry changes the topic slightly to souls--what might it be like to sell one's soul? Little does he know that he's talking to the one person who knows... Dorian tells Henry that that he's sure that everyone has a soul, for better or worse. Languidly, Henry asks Dorian to play some Chopin on the piano. As Dorian plays, Henry muses at length about Dorian's youth and beauty, and his own lost youth. He tells Dorian that he's led an amazing, full life, and mistakenly praises him for still being the same. Dorian corrects him, saying that he's not the same, but Henry doesn't believe it. He thinks that Dorian is perfect. Henry goes on, saying that Dorian has always been loved by the world, even when it denounced him; he says that Dorian is the ideal of their time, and that, though he's never created anything, his whole life has been art. Dorian stops playing and tells Henry again that things are going to be different from now on. He resists Henry's praise of him. After insisting that he's going to change, Dorian reminds Lord Henry that the older man poisoned him with the yellow book, all those years ago. Henry doesn't buy it, saying that art doesn't influence real life. Dorian says his goodbyes and extricates himself from Henry, after wearily promising to see him the next day."],"next summary id":"chapter 20","next chapter":"During the walk home from Henry's, Dorian enjoys the warm evening.

He thinks back on his innocent boyhood, and knows that he's ruined himself--but can't he change back? Dorian regards his own beautiful face in the mirror, and suddenly is filled with self-loathing. He throws the mirror down, shattering it. He can't believe he's invested so much in youth--what a foolish thing! Now, Dorian tries to get over the past and think of the future. As far as he can tell, he's perfectly safe from the law, and from anyone ever knowing about the things he's done. Looking back, he blames everything on the portrait; it was the portrait's fault that he killed Basil, after all. Dorian longs for a new life, and wonders if he's already started it by saving Hetty, the young country girl, from his corruption. He wonders if this one good deed has started making the portrait look any different yet. Excited and anxious, Dorian goes upstairs to see. In the schoolroom, Dorian confronts his portrait again, certain that it will look less loathsome. However, the terrible truth is that it's actually worse than ever--the bloodstain on the figure's hand that dates from Basil's death looks even brighter and more real. Furthermore, there's a new look of hypocrisy on its face--the portrait knows, even if Dorian doesn't, that he doesn't actually want to become good again. Dorian wonders for a moment if he should confess all his crimes, but quickly dismisses that idea. Instead, he decides to destroy all the evidence of his shameful life--the portrait itself. Fittingly, Dorian grabs the very same knife he used to kill Basil, and stabs the picture with it. Downstairs, Dorian's servants are terrified--they hear a mysterious scream and a crash. It's even audible outside, and two passing gentleman go to get a policeman. The three men knock on the door, but there's no answer. When they find out that it's Dorian Gray's house, they leave--they don't want to help him. Dorian's valet, Francis, and the housekeeper, Mrs. Leaf, are petrified. Finally, Francis and two other servants go up to the schoolroom to investigate. They easily knock down the old door. Inside the schoolroom, the servants discover something terrible: the portrait of their master, Dorian, restored to its youth and beauty, hangs over an old, hideous, dead man with a knife in his heart. When they look at the mysterious corpse's rings, they realize that it's Dorian.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"\nIt was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and\ndid not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled home,\nsmoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.  He\nheard one of them whisper to the other, \"That is Dorian Gray.\" He\nremembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared\nat, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing his own name now.  Half\nthe charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was\nthat no one knew who he was.  He had often told the girl whom he had\nlured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.  He had\ntold her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and\nanswered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.  What a\nlaugh she had!--just like a thrush singing.  And how pretty she had\nbeen in her cotton dresses and her large hats!  She knew nothing, but\nshe had everything that he had lost.\n\nWhen he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He sent\nhim to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and\nbegan to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\n\nWas it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild longing\nfor the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as\nLord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had tarnished himself,\nfilled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he\nhad been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible\njoy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had\nbeen the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to\nshame.  But was it all irretrievable?  Was there no hope for him?\n\nAh! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that\nthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the\nunsullied splendour of eternal youth!  All his failure had been due to\nthat.  Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure\nswift penalty along with it.  There was purification in punishment.\nNot \"Forgive us our sins\" but \"Smite us for our iniquities\" should be\nthe prayer of man to a most just God.\n\nThe curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many\nyears ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids\nlaughed round it as of old.  He took it up, as he had done on that\nnight of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal\npicture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished\nshield.  Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a\nmad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: \"The world is changed\nbecause you are made of ivory and gold.  The curves of your lips\nrewrite history.\"  The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated\nthem over and over to himself.  Then he loathed his own beauty, and\nflinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters\nbeneath his heel.  It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty\nand the youth that he had prayed for.  But for those two things, his\nlife might have been free from stain.  His beauty had been to him but a\nmask, his youth but a mockery.  What was youth at best?  A green, an\nunripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.  Why had he\nworn its livery?  Youth had spoiled him.\n\nIt was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.  It\nwas of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  James\nVane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.  Alan Campbell\nhad shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the\nsecret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement, such as it\nwas, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.  It was\nalready waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor, indeed, was it the\ndeath of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.  It was the\nliving death of his own soul that troubled him.  Basil had painted the\nportrait that had marred his life.  He could not forgive him that.  It\nwas the portrait that had done everything.  Basil had said things to\nhim that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.  The\nmurder had been simply the madness of a moment.  As for Alan Campbell,\nhis suicide had been his own act.  He had chosen to do it.  It was\nnothing to him.\n\nA new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting\nfor.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent\nthing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would be\ngood.\n\nAs he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\nthe locked room had changed.  Surely it was not still so horrible as it\nhad been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\nevery sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of evil\nhad already gone away.  He would go and look.\n\nHe took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.  As he unbarred the\ndoor, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\nand lingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and\nthe hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\nto him.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\n\nHe went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\ndragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and\nindignation broke from him.  He could see no change, save that in the\neyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\nthe hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if\npossible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\nbrighter, and more like blood newly spilled.  Then he trembled.  Had it\nbeen merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or the\ndesire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\nlaugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\nfiner than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?  And why was the\nred stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have crept like a\nhorrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was blood on the\npainted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand\nthat had not held the knife.  Confess?  Did it mean that he was to\nconfess?  To give himself up and be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt\nthat the idea was monstrous.  Besides, even if he did confess, who\nwould believe him?  There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\nEverything belonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned\nwhat had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\nThey would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was\nhis duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public\natonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to\nearth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would cleanse him\ntill he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his shoulders.\nThe death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.  He was thinking\nof Hetty Merton.  For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul\nthat he was looking at.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there\nbeen nothing more in his renunciation than that?  There had been\nsomething more.  At least he thought so.  But who could tell? ... No.\nThere had been nothing more.  Through vanity he had spared her.  In\nhypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.  For curiosity's sake he\nhad tried the denial of self.  He recognized that now.\n\nBut this murder--was it to dog him all his life?  Was he always to be\nburdened by his past?  Was he really to confess?  Never.  There was\nonly one bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself--that\nwas evidence.  He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  Once\nit had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.  Of\nlate he had felt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night.\nWhen he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes\nshould look upon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions.\nIts mere memory had marred many moments of joy.  It had been like\nconscience to him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.\n\nHe looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.  He\nhad cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.  It\nwas bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it would\nkill the painter's work, and all that that meant.  It would kill the\npast, and when that was dead, he would be free.  It would kill this\nmonstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at\npeace.  He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\n\nThere was a cry heard, and a crash.  The cry was so horrible in its\nagony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\nTwo gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\nup at the great house.  They walked on till they met a policeman and\nbrought him back.  The man rang the bell several times, but there was\nno answer.  Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was\nall dark.  After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico\nand watched.\n\n\"Whose house is that, Constable?\" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\n\n\"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,\" answered the policeman.\n\nThey looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.  One of\nthem was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.\n\nInside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics\nwere talking in low whispers to each other.  Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\nand wringing her hands.  Francis was as pale as death.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\nfootmen and crept upstairs.  They knocked, but there was no reply.\nThey called out.  Everything was still.  Finally, after vainly trying\nto force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the\nbalcony.  The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old.\n\nWhen they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\nof their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\nexquisite youth and beauty.  Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\nevening dress, with a knife in his heart.  He was withered, wrinkled,\nand loathsome of visage.  It was not till they had examined the rings\nthat they recognized who it was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":1897.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 20","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210304030722\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/picture-dorian-gray\/summary\/chapter-20","summary_text":"Dorian walks pensively home from Henry's house in the pleasant, warm evening air.

Dorian, it seems, has decided to change his ways. Henry tells him that he is perfect the way he is and that there's no use trying to change, but Dorian replies that \"I have done too many dreadful things in my life,\" and that \"I began my good actions yesterday.\" His so-called \"good action\" was his treatment of Hetty, a beautiful young peasant girl who reminded him of Sibyl Vane. She fell in love with Dorian, but instead of taking advantage of her and breaking her heart, as was his usual way, he \"determined to leave her as flower-like as had found her.\" Henry mocks him and asks whether he's sure that Hetty \"isn't floating at the present moment in some star-lit millpond...like Ophelia.\" This upsets Dorian, as he desperately wants to believe in the value of his good intentions. The conversation turns towards the whereabouts of Basil Hallward. The painter's disappearance, now six weeks old, is still the talk of the town, along with Henry's divorce and the suicide of Alan Campbell. Henry asks Dorian to play Chopin for him, because \"The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.\" At the piano, Dorian nonchalantly asks what Henry would think if he told him that he had murdered Basil. \"I would say,\" he responds, \"that you were posing for a character that didn't suit you.\" Such crimes, Henry believes, are the specialty of the lower classes. Besides, Henry cannot imagine that Basil would have met such a romantic end, because his paintings had steadily declined in the years following his soiled friendship with Dorian. His painting of Dorian was, apparently, his final masterpiece. Henry believes that the painting was stolen a long time ago, and Dorian claims to have forgotten all about it. Henry catches Dorian off-guard by paraphrasing the Bible, asking him: \"what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose...his soul?\" When Dorian is startled by this statement, Henry just laughs, telling him that he heard a preacher posing this quesiton to a crowd during a walk through the park on a rainy day. Henry describes his amusement at the spectacle of the somber crowd standing in the rain, listening to \"an uncouth Christian in a macintosh.\" He apparently wanted to tell the preacher that \"Art had a soul, but that man did not.\" Henry's light-heartedness offends Dorian, who says that \"The soul is a terrible reality...It can be poisoned or made perfect.\" He tells Henry that he is certain of this fact, to which Henry replies, \"then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true.\" Dorian begins to play a nocturne by Chopin, which greatly affects Henry and prompts a rambling tirade on romance and how exquisite Dorian's life has been. Dorian agrees, but reminds Henry that he has turned over a new leaf, and that he will never forgive him for his corrupting influence. On his way out, Henry invites Dorian to lunch the next day, and Dorian reluctantly agrees to accompany the older man.","This whole James Vane incident seems to have shaken Dorian significantly. Back in London, he informs Lord Henry that he's going to become a good person again. Henry doesn't believe it, nor does he think Dorian should change at all. In his view, his friend is perfect. For about the thousandth time, we think about how warped Lord Henry is. Apparently, the day before, Dorian was staying out in the countryside by himself, and Henry comments that it's a lot easier to be good out there, since there's nothing to do. Dorian continues, saying that he's altered . Lord Henry demands to know what Dorian's done that's so great. Dorian tells Henry about a young girl that he met and fell in love with in the countryside. She reminded him of Sibyl Vane, and she totally fell for him. However, instead of corrupting her and destroying her life, he decided to let her go--he leaves her in her innocent state. Dorian thinks this good deed is enough to set him on the path to righteousness, despite Henry's doubts. Lord Henry continues to mock Dorian's fantasies. Dorian abruptly changes the subject, and asks Henry what's going on around town. Apparently, the gossip around their club is all about Basil--people are still discussing his disappearance. We also hear in passing that Alan Campbell committed suicide . Dorian plays it cool, and asks Henry what he thinks happened to Basil; Lord Henry's basically like, \"Screw Basil! Listen to me talk about my life.\" But Dorian doesn't want to let it go. He asks Henry if he's ever wondered if Basil was murdered--or, for that matter, if anyone else thinks that. Henry's just not that concerned; besides, he doesn't think Basil was interesting enough to get himself murdered. Dorian asks an interesting hypothetical question: what would Henry think if he said that he had killed Basil? Henry basically laughs this off, too, saying that crime is for the lower classes. He honestly just doesn't care, and even jokes that Basil probably drowned in the river Seine. Since Basil's paintings haven't been that great lately, Henry doesn't think there's anything to be sad about. Henry brings up the portrait, which he identifies as one of Basil's great works. Apparently Dorian told him that it was either lost or stolen. They discuss the painting a bit more, and Dorian confesses that he never liked it . Lord Henry changes the topic slightly to souls--what might it be like to sell one's soul? Little does he know that he's talking to the one person who knows... Dorian tells Henry that that he's sure that everyone has a soul, for better or worse. Languidly, Henry asks Dorian to play some Chopin on the piano. As Dorian plays, Henry muses at length about Dorian's youth and beauty, and his own lost youth. He tells Dorian that he's led an amazing, full life, and mistakenly praises him for still being the same. Dorian corrects him, saying that he's not the same, but Henry doesn't believe it. He thinks that Dorian is perfect. Henry goes on, saying that Dorian has always been loved by the world, even when it denounced him; he says that Dorian is the ideal of their time, and that, though he's never created anything, his whole life has been art. Dorian stops playing and tells Henry again that things are going to be different from now on. He resists Henry's praise of him. After insisting that he's going to change, Dorian reminds Lord Henry that the older man poisoned him with the yellow book, all those years ago. Henry doesn't buy it, saying that art doesn't influence real life. Dorian says his goodbyes and extricates himself from Henry, after wearily promising to see him the next day."],"next summary id":"chapter 20","next chapter":"Dorian walks pensively home from Henry's house in the pleasant, warm evening air.

As Chapter 19 opens, Dorian and Lord Henry apparently have just dined at the older man's home. Despite recently having gone through a divorce, Lord Henry is his usual witty self. Dorian seems more pensive, even grave. They are discussing Dorian's vow to change his behavior. Lord Henry says that Dorian is perfectly fine as he is. Dorian, however, says that he has done \\\"too many dreadful things\\\" in his life. He wants to reform. In fact, he began the previous day. He was staying alone at a small inn in the country and was seeing a young girl named Hetty Merton. She reminded him of Sibyl Vane in her beauty and innocence. A simple village girl, Dorian is fairly sure that he loved her. They were to run off together that morning at dawn, but he spared the child by leaving her \\\"as flowerlike as I had found her.\\\" Lord Henry brings up the disappearance of Basil; he also mentions his own divorce and Alan Campbell's suicide. Lord Henry allows that only death and vulgarity cannot be explained. He asks Dorian to play the piano. Dorian plays for a while but stops and asks Lord Henry if he ever thought that Basil might have been murdered. Lord Henry dismisses the idea with a quip. When Dorian asks what Lord Henry would say if Dorian claimed to be the murderer, Lord Henry states that the crime does not suit Dorian; it is too vulgar. Lord Henry then asks about Basil's portrait of Dorian. Dorian confirms that it was lost or stolen, but he never cared much for it anyway. Lord Henry tells of walking through the park the previous Sunday and observing a group of people listening to a preacher who asked, \\\"What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?\\\" Lord Henry found this \\\"uncouth Christian\\\" to be \\\"curious\\\" and \\\"hysterical.\\\" Dorian, however, is not amused. Lord Henry has no interest in a serious discussion and indirectly asks Dorian to reveal the secret of his youth. To retrieve his youth, says the older man, \\\"I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.\\\" He wishes he could change places with Dorian, and he is pleased that the younger man has never actually \\\"done anything.\\\" Dorian's life has been his art. For once, Dorian is in no mood for flattery and says he wishes to retire early. The subject of the \\\"yellow book\\\" occurs to Dorian, and he asks Lord Henry never to lend the destructive volume to anyone else. They agree to meet the next morning. Back home, Dorian wonders if he will ever really change. He reflects on Basil's death and Alan Campbell's suicide, but what really bothers him is the death of his own soul. He rationalizes that Basil painted the damaging portrait and said \\\"unbearable\\\" things to Dorian. Alan Campbell's suicide was the man's own doing, not Dorian's. They are nothing to him. His own life is his only concern. Wondering if the portrait has changed since his virtuous behavior toward Hetty Merton, he creeps upstairs to see. In the attic room, Dorian lifts the cloth off the portrait. If anything, the picture looks even more evil. Around the eyes there is \\\"a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.\\\" Blood has spread over the fingers, onto the feet, even to the other hand. Dorian shudders. He wonders if he should confess Basil's murder but dismisses the idea. The portrait itself is the only evidence against him. He no longer enjoys its record of his debauchery. He worries that it will be discovered and decides to destroy it. The knife he used to murder Basil is still in the room. Using it to \\\"kill the past,\\\" he grabs the knife and stabs the portrait. The servants are awakened by a horrible scream and a crash. Two passersby outside are so alarmed that they summon a policeman. No one inside Dorian's house responds when the officer rings at the door. After fifteen minutes or so, Francis ascends the staircase with two other servants. No one answers their knock on the attic door, and they cannot force it open. They climb to the roof, drop to the balcony, open a window, and go into the attic. There, they find an old and ugly man lying in front of their master's portrait. In the portrait, Dorian appears as beautiful and young as he had the day before.\", \"analysis\": \"In the Faust legend, the main character ultimately confronts the loss of his soul but is incapable of seeking redemption through confession and absolution. He despairs and feels that he is beneath pardon or that there is no God or power strong enough to save him. In this sense, the Faust protagonist still suffers the sin of pride in that he sees his own case as so special that it is beyond God's help. Despair is the one unpardonable sin because the sinner is incapable of asking to be pardoned. Traditionally, despair is symbolized by suicide. In the closing chapters of The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dorian's behavior and attitude are consistent with this Faust tradition. Dorian has matured from the naive, vain youth in Basil's studio. He has grown into a man who was at first despicable but in the end is almost likable. Perhaps he is more pitiable than likable. However, he cannot find salvation because he is incapable of setting aside his pride, confessing, and asking for absolution. In Chapter 19, as the after-dinner scene opens at Lord Henry's, Dorian is bursting with pride because of a recent act of decency. He has returned Hetty Merton to her country life after winning her devotion. Unfortunately, instead of seeing this act as only one small step, Dorian expects instant reward. When he checks the portrait for some sign of his newfound virtue, he finds only a look of cunning about the eyes and a wrinkle of hypocrisy in the mouth. There seems to be fresh blood on the hands. Instead of redeeming his soul, his act of supposed redemption has tarnished his soul even more because the act was motivated by selfishness. Dorian cannot redeem his soul because he is still primarily interested in himself. He dismisses the deaths of Basil and Alan Campbell. The first, he decides, was inevitable; the second made his own choice. In neither case does Dorian accept his own responsibility. Still, he is torn because he realizes that the \\\"soul is a terrible reality.\\\" He thinks that a person should pray for punishment, but he fails to understand that the only way of absolving immoral responsibility is to pray for forgiveness. In the novel's powerful final paragraphs, Dorian, in effect, commits suicide. He despises the figure in the portrait, but that is who he has become. When he slashes at the painting with the knife, appropriately the same knife that killed Basil, Dorian kills himself. The horrible cry, which awakens the servants and startles the men on the street, carries with it the agony of eighteen years of horror. Glossary idyll a scene or event of rural simplicity.

Pray, don't change.\"\n\nDorian Gray shook his head.  \"No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful\nthings in my life.  I am not going to do any more.  I began my good\nactions yesterday.\"\n\n\"Where were you yesterday?\"\n\n\"In the country, Harry.  I was staying at a little inn by myself.\"\n\n\"My dear boy,\" said Lord Henry, smiling, \"anybody can be good in the\ncountry.  There are no temptations there.  That is the reason why\npeople who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized.\nCivilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to.  There are\nonly two ways by which man can reach it.  One is by being cultured, the\nother by being corrupt.  Country people have no opportunity of being\neither, so they stagnate.\"\n\n\"Culture and corruption,\" echoed Dorian.  \"I have known something of\nboth.  It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found\ntogether.  For I have a new ideal, Harry.  I am going to alter.  I\nthink I have altered.\"\n\n\"You have not yet told me what your good action was.  Or did you say\nyou had done more than one?\" asked his companion as he spilled into his\nplate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a\nperforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.\n\n\"I can tell you, Harry.  It is not a story I could tell to any one\nelse.  I spared somebody.  It sounds vain, but you understand what I\nmean.  She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane.  I\nthink it was that which first attracted me to her.  You remember Sibyl,\ndon't you?  How long ago that seems!  Well, Hetty was not one of our\nown class, of course.  She was simply a girl in a village.  But I\nreally loved her.  I am quite sure that I loved her.  All during this\nwonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her\ntwo or three times a week.  Yesterday she met me in a little orchard.\nThe apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was\nlaughing.  We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn.\nSuddenly I determined to leave her as flowerlike as I had found her.\"\n\n\"I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill\nof real pleasure, Dorian,\" interrupted Lord Henry.  \"But I can finish\nyour idyll for you.  You gave her good advice and broke her heart.\nThat was the beginning of your reformation.\"\n\n\"Harry, you are horrible!  You mustn't say these dreadful things.\nHetty's heart is not broken.  Of course, she cried and all that.  But\nthere is no disgrace upon her.  She can live, like Perdita, in her\ngarden of mint and marigold.\"\n\n\"And weep over a faithless Florizel,\" said Lord Henry, laughing, as he\nleaned back in his chair.  \"My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously\nboyish moods.  Do you think this girl will ever be really content now\nwith any one of her own rank?  I suppose she will be married some day\nto a rough carter or a grinning ploughman.  Well, the fact of having\nmet you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she\nwill be wretched.  From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I\nthink much of your great renunciation.  Even as a beginning, it is\npoor.  Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the\npresent moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies\nround her, like Ophelia?\"\n\n\"I can't bear this, Harry!  You mock at everything, and then suggest\nthe most serious tragedies.  I am sorry I told you now.  I don't care\nwhat you say to me.  I know I was right in acting as I did.  Poor\nHetty!  As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at\nthe window, like a spray of jasmine.  Don't let us talk about it any\nmore, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have\ndone for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever\nknown, is really a sort of sin.  I want to be better.  I am going to be\nbetter.  Tell me something about yourself.  What is going on in town?\nI have not been to the club for days.\"\n\n\"The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance.\"\n\n\"I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,\" said\nDorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.\n\n\"My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and\nthe British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having\nmore than one topic every three months.  They have been very fortunate\nlately, however.  They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell's\nsuicide.  Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.\nScotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left\nfor Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor\nBasil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris\nat all.  I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has\nbeen seen in San Francisco.  It is an odd thing, but every one who\ndisappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.  It must be a\ndelightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.\"\n\n\"What do you think has happened to Basil?\" asked Dorian, holding up his\nBurgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could\ndiscuss the matter so calmly.\n\n\"I have not the slightest idea.  If Basil chooses to hide himself, it\nis no business of mine.  If he is dead, I don't want to think about\nhim.  Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me.  I hate it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said the younger man wearily.\n\n\"Because,\" said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt\ntrellis of an open vinaigrette box, \"one can survive everything\nnowadays except that.  Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in\nthe nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.  Let us have our\ncoffee in the music-room, Dorian.  You must play Chopin to me.  The man\nwith whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.  Poor Victoria!\nI was very fond of her.  The house is rather lonely without her.  Of\ncourse, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit.  But then one\nregrets the loss even of one's worst habits.  Perhaps one regrets them\nthe most.  They are such an essential part of one's personality.\"\n\nDorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next\nroom, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white\nand black ivory of the keys.  After the coffee had been brought in, he\nstopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, \"Harry, did it ever\noccur to you that Basil was murdered?\"\n\nLord Henry yawned.  \"Basil was very popular, and always wore a\nWaterbury watch.  Why should he have been murdered?  He was not clever\nenough to have enemies.  Of course, he had a wonderful genius for\npainting.  But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as\npossible.  Basil was really rather dull.  He only interested me once,\nand that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration\nfor you and that you were the dominant motive of his art.\"\n\n\"I was very fond of Basil,\" said Dorian with a note of sadness in his\nvoice.  \"But don't people say that he was murdered?\"\n\n\"Oh, some of the papers do.  It does not seem to me to be at all\nprobable.  I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not\nthe sort of man to have gone to them.  He had no curiosity.  It was his\nchief defect.\"\n\n\"What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?\"\nsaid the younger man.  He watched him intently after he had spoken.\n\n\"I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that\ndoesn't suit you.  All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.\nIt is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder.  I am sorry if I hurt\nyour vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true.  Crime belongs\nexclusively to the lower orders.  I don't blame them in the smallest\ndegree.  I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us,\nsimply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.\"\n\n\"A method of procuring sensations?  Do you think, then, that a man who\nhas once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?\nDon't tell me that.\"\n\n\"Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,\" cried Lord\nHenry, laughing.  \"That is one of the most important secrets of life.\nI should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake.  One should\nnever do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.  But let us\npass from poor Basil.  I wish I could believe that he had come to such\na really romantic end as you suggest, but I can't. I dare say he fell\ninto the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the\nscandal.  Yes:  I should fancy that was his end.  I see him lying now\non his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges\nfloating over him and long weeds catching in his hair.  Do you know, I\ndon't think he would have done much more good work.  During the last\nten years his painting had gone off very much.\"\n\nDorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began\nto stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged\nbird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo\nperch.  As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf\nof crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards\nand forwards.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of\nhis pocket; \"his painting had quite gone off.  It seemed to me to have\nlost something.  It had lost an ideal.  When you and he ceased to be\ngreat friends, he ceased to be a great artist.  What was it separated\nyou?  I suppose he bored you.  If so, he never forgave you.  It's a\nhabit bores have.  By the way, what has become of that wonderful\nportrait he did of you?  I don't think I have ever seen it since he\nfinished it.  Oh!  I remember your telling me years ago that you had\nsent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the\nway.  You never got it back?  What a pity! it was really a\nmasterpiece.  I remember I wanted to buy it.  I wish I had now.  It\nbelonged to Basil's best period.  Since then, his work was that curious\nmixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man\nto be called a representative British artist.  Did you advertise for\nit?  You should.\"\n\n\"I forget,\" said Dorian.  \"I suppose I did.  But I never really liked\nit.  I am sorry I sat for it.  The memory of the thing is hateful to\nme.  Why do you talk of it?  It used to remind me of those curious\nlines in some play--Hamlet, I think--how do they run?--\n\n    \"Like the painting of a sorrow,\n     A face without a heart.\"\n\nYes:  that is what it was like.\"\n\nLord Henry laughed.  \"If a man treats life artistically, his brain is\nhis heart,\" he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.\n\nDorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.\n\"'Like the painting of a sorrow,'\" he repeated, \"'a face without a\nheart.'\"\n\nThe elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.  \"By\nthe way, Dorian,\" he said after a pause, \"'what does it profit a man if\nhe gain the whole world and lose--how does the quotation run?--his own\nsoul'?\"\n\nThe music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.\n\"Why do you ask me that, Harry?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,\n\"I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.\nThat is all.  I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by\nthe Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people\nlistening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the\nman yelling out that question to his audience.  It struck me as being\nrather dramatic.  London is very rich in curious effects of that kind.\nA wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly\nwhite faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful\nphrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips--it was really very\ngood in its way, quite a suggestion.  I thought of telling the prophet\nthat art had a soul, but that man had not.  I am afraid, however, he\nwould not have understood me.\"\n\n\"Don't, Harry.  The soul is a terrible reality.  It can be bought, and\nsold, and bartered away.  It can be poisoned, or made perfect.  There\nis a soul in each one of us.  I know it.\"\n\n\"Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Ah! then it must be an illusion.  The things one feels absolutely\ncertain about are never true.  That is the fatality of faith, and the\nlesson of romance.  How grave you are!  Don't be so serious.  What have\nyou or I to do with the superstitions of our age?  No:  we have given\nup our belief in the soul.  Play me something.  Play me a nocturne,\nDorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept\nyour youth.  You must have some secret.  I am only ten years older than\nyou are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow.  You are really\nwonderful, Dorian.  You have never looked more charming than you do\nto-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first.  You were rather\ncheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.  You have changed, of\ncourse, but not in appearance.  I wish you would tell me your secret.\nTo get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take\nexercise, get up early, or be respectable.  Youth!  There is nothing\nlike it.  It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth.  The only\npeople to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much\nyounger than myself.  They seem in front of me.  Life has revealed to\nthem her latest wonder.  As for the aged, I always contradict the aged.\nI do it on principle.  If you ask them their opinion on something that\nhappened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in\n1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew\nabsolutely nothing.  How lovely that thing you are playing is!  I\nwonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the\nvilla and the salt spray dashing against the panes?  It is marvellously\nromantic.  What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that\nis not imitative!  Don't stop.  I want music to-night. It seems to me\nthat you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you.\nI have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of.  The\ntragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.  I am\namazed sometimes at my own sincerity.  Ah, Dorian, how happy you are!\nWhat an exquisite life you have had!  You have drunk deeply of\neverything.  You have crushed the grapes against your palate.  Nothing\nhas been hidden from you.  And it has all been to you no more than the\nsound of music.  It has not marred you.  You are still the same.\"\n\n\"I am not the same, Harry.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are the same.  I wonder what the rest of your life will be.\nDon't spoil it by renunciations.  At present you are a perfect type.\nDon't make yourself incomplete.  You are quite flawless now.  You need\nnot shake your head:  you know you are.  Besides, Dorian, don't deceive\nyourself.  Life is not governed by will or intention.  Life is a\nquestion of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which\nthought hides itself and passion has its dreams.  You may fancy\nyourself safe and think yourself strong.  But a chance tone of colour\nin a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once\nloved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten\npoem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music\nthat you had ceased to play--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things\nlike these that our lives depend.  Browning writes about that\nsomewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us.  There are\nmoments when the odour of _lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I\nhave to live the strangest month of my life over again.  I wish I could\nchange places with you, Dorian.  The world has cried out against us\nboth, but it has always worshipped you.  It always will worship you.\nYou are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is\nafraid it has found.  I am so glad that you have never done anything,\nnever carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything\noutside of yourself!  Life has been your art.  You have set yourself to\nmusic.  Your days are your sonnets.\"\n\nDorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.\n\"Yes, life has been exquisite,\" he murmured, \"but I am not going to\nhave the same life, Harry.  And you must not say these extravagant\nthings to me.  You don't know everything about me.  I think that if you\ndid, even you would turn from me.  You laugh.  Don't laugh.\"\n\n\"Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?  Go back and give me the\nnocturne over again.  Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that\nhangs in the dusky air.  She is waiting for you to charm her, and if\nyou play she will come closer to the earth.  You won't?  Let us go to\nthe club, then.  It has been a charming evening, and we must end it\ncharmingly.  There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know\nyou--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son.  He has already copied\nyour neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you.  He is quite\ndelightful and rather reminds me of you.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes.  \"But I am tired\nto-night, Harry.  I shan't go to the club.  It is nearly eleven, and I\nwant to go to bed early.\"\n\n\"Do stay.  You have never played so well as to-night. There was\nsomething in your touch that was wonderful.  It had more expression\nthan I had ever heard from it before.\"\n\n\"It is because I am going to be good,\" he answered, smiling.  \"I am a\nlittle changed already.\"\n\n\"You cannot change to me, Dorian,\" said Lord Henry.  \"You and I will\nalways be friends.\"\n\n\"Yet you poisoned me with a book once.  I should not forgive that.\nHarry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one.  It\ndoes harm.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize.  You will soon be\ngoing about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people\nagainst all the sins of which you have grown tired.  You are much too\ndelightful to do that.  Besides, it is no use.  You and I are what we\nare, and will be what we will be.  As for being poisoned by a book,\nthere is no such thing as that.  Art has no influence upon action.  It\nannihilates the desire to act.  It is superbly sterile.  The books that\nthe world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.\nThat is all.  But we won't discuss literature.  Come round to-morrow. I\nam going to ride at eleven.  We might go together, and I will take you\nto lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome.  She is a charming woman, and\nwants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.\nMind you come.  Or shall we lunch with our little duchess?  She says\nshe never sees you now.  Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?  I thought\nyou would be.  Her clever tongue gets on one's nerves.  Well, in any\ncase, be here at eleven.\"\n\n\"Must I really come, Harry?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  The park is quite lovely now.  I don't think there have\nbeen such lilacs since the year I met you.\"\n\n\"Very well.  I shall be here at eleven,\" said Dorian.  \"Good night,\nHarry.\"  As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he\nhad something more to say.  Then he sighed and went out.\n\n\n\nIt was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and\ndid not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled home,\nsmoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.  He\nheard one of them whisper to the other, \"That is Dorian Gray.\" He\nremembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared\nat, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing his own name now.  Half\nthe charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was\nthat no one knew who he was.  He had often told the girl whom he had\nlured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.  He had\ntold her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and\nanswered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.  What a\nlaugh she had!--just like a thrush singing.  And how pretty she had\nbeen in her cotton dresses and her large hats!  She knew nothing, but\nshe had everything that he had lost.\n\nWhen he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He sent\nhim to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and\nbegan to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\n\nWas it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild longing\nfor the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as\nLord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had tarnished himself,\nfilled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he\nhad been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible\njoy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had\nbeen the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to\nshame.  But was it all irretrievable?  Was there no hope for him?\n\nAh! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that\nthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the\nunsullied splendour of eternal youth!  All his failure had been due to\nthat.  Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure\nswift penalty along with it.  There was purification in punishment.\nNot \"Forgive us our sins\" but \"Smite us for our iniquities\" should be\nthe prayer of man to a most just God.\n\nThe curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many\nyears ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids\nlaughed round it as of old.  He took it up, as he had done on that\nnight of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal\npicture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished\nshield.  Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a\nmad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: \"The world is changed\nbecause you are made of ivory and gold.  The curves of your lips\nrewrite history.\"  The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated\nthem over and over to himself.  Then he loathed his own beauty, and\nflinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters\nbeneath his heel.  It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty\nand the youth that he had prayed for.  But for those two things, his\nlife might have been free from stain.  His beauty had been to him but a\nmask, his youth but a mockery.  What was youth at best?  A green, an\nunripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.  Why had he\nworn its livery?  Youth had spoiled him.\n\nIt was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.  It\nwas of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  James\nVane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.  Alan Campbell\nhad shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the\nsecret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement, such as it\nwas, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.  It was\nalready waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor, indeed, was it the\ndeath of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.  It was the\nliving death of his own soul that troubled him.  Basil had painted the\nportrait that had marred his life.  He could not forgive him that.  It\nwas the portrait that had done everything.  Basil had said things to\nhim that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.  The\nmurder had been simply the madness of a moment.  As for Alan Campbell,\nhis suicide had been his own act.  He had chosen to do it.  It was\nnothing to him.\n\nA new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting\nfor.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent\nthing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would be\ngood.\n\nAs he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\nthe locked room had changed.  Surely it was not still so horrible as it\nhad been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\nevery sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of evil\nhad already gone away.  He would go and look.\n\nHe took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.  As he unbarred the\ndoor, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\nand lingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and\nthe hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\nto him.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\n\nHe went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\ndragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and\nindignation broke from him.  He could see no change, save that in the\neyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\nthe hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if\npossible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\nbrighter, and more like blood newly spilled.  Then he trembled.  Had it\nbeen merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or the\ndesire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\nlaugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\nfiner than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?  And why was the\nred stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have crept like a\nhorrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was blood on the\npainted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand\nthat had not held the knife.  Confess?  Did it mean that he was to\nconfess?  To give himself up and be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt\nthat the idea was monstrous.  Besides, even if he did confess, who\nwould believe him?  There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\nEverything belonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned\nwhat had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\nThey would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was\nhis duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public\natonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to\nearth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would cleanse him\ntill he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his shoulders.\nThe death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.  He was thinking\nof Hetty Merton.  For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul\nthat he was looking at.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there\nbeen nothing more in his renunciation than that?  There had been\nsomething more.  At least he thought so.  But who could tell? ... No.\nThere had been nothing more.  Through vanity he had spared her.  In\nhypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.  For curiosity's sake he\nhad tried the denial of self.  He recognized that now.\n\nBut this murder--was it to dog him all his life?  Was he always to be\nburdened by his past?  Was he really to confess?  Never.  There was\nonly one bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself--that\nwas evidence.  He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  Once\nit had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.  Of\nlate he had felt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night.\nWhen he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes\nshould look upon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions.\nIts mere memory had marred many moments of joy.  It had been like\nconscience to him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.\n\nHe looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.  He\nhad cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.  It\nwas bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it would\nkill the painter's work, and all that that meant.  It would kill the\npast, and when that was dead, he would be free.  It would kill this\nmonstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at\npeace.  He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\n\nThere was a cry heard, and a crash.  The cry was so horrible in its\nagony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\nTwo gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\nup at the great house.  They walked on till they met a policeman and\nbrought him back.  The man rang the bell several times, but there was\nno answer.  Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was\nall dark.  After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico\nand watched.\n\n\"Whose house is that, Constable?\" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\n\n\"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,\" answered the policeman.\n\nThey looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.  One of\nthem was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.\n\nInside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics\nwere talking in low whispers to each other.  Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\nand wringing her hands.  Francis was as pale as death.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\nfootmen and crept upstairs.  They knocked, but there was no reply.\nThey called out.  Everything was still.  Finally, after vainly trying\nto force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the\nbalcony.  The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old.\n\nWhen they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\nof their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\nexquisite youth and beauty.  Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\nevening dress, with a knife in his heart.  He was withered, wrinkled,\nand loathsome of visage.  It was not till they had examined the rings\nthat they recognized who it was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":5436.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 19-20","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201219150422\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/p\/the-picture-of-dorian-gray\/summary-and-analysis\/chapters-1920","summary_text":"Approximately six months have passed. As Chapter 19 opens, Dorian and Lord Henry apparently have just dined at the older man's home. Despite recently having gone through a divorce, Lord Henry is his usual witty self. Dorian seems more pensive, even grave. They are discussing Dorian's vow to change his behavior. Lord Henry says that Dorian is perfectly fine as he is. Dorian, however, says that he has done \"too many dreadful things\" in his life. He wants to reform. In fact, he began the previous day. He was staying alone at a small inn in the country and was seeing a young girl named Hetty Merton. She reminded him of Sibyl Vane in her beauty and innocence. A simple village girl, Dorian is fairly sure that he loved her. They were to run off together that morning at dawn, but he spared the child by leaving her \"as flowerlike as I had found her.\" Lord Henry brings up the disappearance of Basil; he also mentions his own divorce and Alan Campbell's suicide. Lord Henry allows that only death and vulgarity cannot be explained. He asks Dorian to play the piano. Dorian plays for a while but stops and asks Lord Henry if he ever thought that Basil might have been murdered. Lord Henry dismisses the idea with a quip. When Dorian asks what Lord Henry would say if Dorian claimed to be the murderer, Lord Henry states that the crime does not suit Dorian; it is too vulgar. Lord Henry then asks about Basil's portrait of Dorian. Dorian confirms that it was lost or stolen, but he never cared much for it anyway. Lord Henry tells of walking through the park the previous Sunday and observing a group of people listening to a preacher who asked, \"What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?\" Lord Henry found this \"uncouth Christian\" to be \"curious\" and \"hysterical.\" Dorian, however, is not amused. Lord Henry has no interest in a serious discussion and indirectly asks Dorian to reveal the secret of his youth. To retrieve his youth, says the older man, \"I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.\" He wishes he could change places with Dorian, and he is pleased that the younger man has never actually \"done anything.\" Dorian's life has been his art. For once, Dorian is in no mood for flattery and says he wishes to retire early. The subject of the \"yellow book\" occurs to Dorian, and he asks Lord Henry never to lend the destructive volume to anyone else. They agree to meet the next morning. Back home, Dorian wonders if he will ever really change. He reflects on Basil's death and Alan Campbell's suicide, but what really bothers him is the death of his own soul. He rationalizes that Basil painted the damaging portrait and said \"unbearable\" things to Dorian. Alan Campbell's suicide was the man's own doing, not Dorian's. They are nothing to him. His own life is his only concern. Wondering if the portrait has changed since his virtuous behavior toward Hetty Merton, he creeps upstairs to see. In the attic room, Dorian lifts the cloth off the portrait. If anything, the picture looks even more evil. Around the eyes there is \"a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.\" Blood has spread over the fingers, onto the feet, even to the other hand. Dorian shudders. He wonders if he should confess Basil's murder but dismisses the idea. The portrait itself is the only evidence against him. He no longer enjoys its record of his debauchery. He worries that it will be discovered and decides to destroy it. The knife he used to murder Basil is still in the room. Using it to \"kill the past,\" he grabs the knife and stabs the portrait. The servants are awakened by a horrible scream and a crash. Two passersby outside are so alarmed that they summon a policeman. No one inside Dorian's house responds when the officer rings at the door. After fifteen minutes or so, Francis ascends the staircase with two other servants. No one answers their knock on the attic door, and they cannot force it open. They climb to the roof, drop to the balcony, open a window, and go into the attic. There, they find an old and ugly man lying in front of their master's portrait. In the portrait, Dorian appears as beautiful and young as he had the day before.","summary_analysis":"In the Faust legend, the main character ultimately confronts the loss of his soul but is incapable of seeking redemption through confession and absolution. He despairs and feels that he is beneath pardon or that there is no God or power strong enough to save him. In this sense, the Faust protagonist still suffers the sin of pride in that he sees his own case as so special that it is beyond God's help. Despair is the one unpardonable sin because the sinner is incapable of asking to be pardoned. Traditionally, despair is symbolized by suicide. In the closing chapters of The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dorian's behavior and attitude are consistent with this Faust tradition. Dorian has matured from the naive, vain youth in Basil's studio. He has grown into a man who was at first despicable but in the end is almost likable. Perhaps he is more pitiable than likable. However, he cannot find salvation because he is incapable of setting aside his pride, confessing, and asking for absolution. In Chapter 19, as the after-dinner scene opens at Lord Henry's, Dorian is bursting with pride because of a recent act of decency. He has returned Hetty Merton to her country life after winning her devotion. Unfortunately, instead of seeing this act as only one small step, Dorian expects instant reward. When he checks the portrait for some sign of his newfound virtue, he finds only a look of cunning about the eyes and a wrinkle of hypocrisy in the mouth. There seems to be fresh blood on the hands. Instead of redeeming his soul, his act of supposed redemption has tarnished his soul even more because the act was motivated by selfishness. Dorian cannot redeem his soul because he is still primarily interested in himself. He dismisses the deaths of Basil and Alan Campbell. The first, he decides, was inevitable; the second made his own choice. In neither case does Dorian accept his own responsibility. Still, he is torn because he realizes that the \"soul is a terrible reality.\" He thinks that a person should pray for punishment, but he fails to understand that the only way of absolving immoral responsibility is to pray for forgiveness. In the novel's powerful final paragraphs, Dorian, in effect, commits suicide. He despises the figure in the portrait, but that is who he has become. When he slashes at the painting with the knife, appropriately the same knife that killed Basil, Dorian kills himself. The horrible cry, which awakens the servants and startles the men on the street, carries with it the agony of eighteen years of horror. Glossary idyll a scene or event of rural simplicity.

Dorian, it seems, has decided to change his ways. Henry tells him that he is perfect the way he is and that there's no use trying to change, but Dorian replies that \"I have done too many dreadful things in my life,\" and that \"I began my good actions yesterday.\" His so-called \"good action\" was his treatment of Hetty, a beautiful young peasant girl who reminded him of Sibyl Vane. She fell in love with Dorian, but instead of taking advantage of her and breaking her heart, as was his usual way, he \"determined to leave her as flower-like as had found her.\" Henry mocks him and asks whether he's sure that Hetty \"isn't floating at the present moment in some star-lit millpond...like Ophelia.\" This upsets Dorian, as he desperately wants to believe in the value of his good intentions. The conversation turns towards the whereabouts of Basil Hallward. The painter's disappearance, now six weeks old, is still the talk of the town, along with Henry's divorce and the suicide of Alan Campbell. Henry asks Dorian to play Chopin for him, because \"The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.\" At the piano, Dorian nonchalantly asks what Henry would think if he told him that he had murdered Basil. \"I would say,\" he responds, \"that you were posing for a character that didn't suit you.\" Such crimes, Henry believes, are the specialty of the lower classes. Besides, Henry cannot imagine that Basil would have met such a romantic end, because his paintings had steadily declined in the years following his soiled friendship with Dorian. His painting of Dorian was, apparently, his final masterpiece. Henry believes that the painting was stolen a long time ago, and Dorian claims to have forgotten all about it. Henry catches Dorian off-guard by paraphrasing the Bible, asking him: \"what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose...his soul?\" When Dorian is startled by this statement, Henry just laughs, telling him that he heard a preacher posing this quesiton to a crowd during a walk through the park on a rainy day. Henry describes his amusement at the spectacle of the somber crowd standing in the rain, listening to \"an uncouth Christian in a macintosh.\" He apparently wanted to tell the preacher that \"Art had a soul, but that man did not.\" Henry's light-heartedness offends Dorian, who says that \"The soul is a terrible reality...It can be poisoned or made perfect.\" He tells Henry that he is certain of this fact, to which Henry replies, \"then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true.\" Dorian begins to play a nocturne by Chopin, which greatly affects Henry and prompts a rambling tirade on romance and how exquisite Dorian's life has been. Dorian agrees, but reminds Henry that he has turned over a new leaf, and that he will never forgive him for his corrupting influence. On his way out, Henry invites Dorian to lunch the next day, and Dorian reluctantly agrees to accompany the older man.","This whole James Vane incident seems to have shaken Dorian significantly. Back in London, he informs Lord Henry that he's going to become a good person again. Henry doesn't believe it, nor does he think Dorian should change at all. In his view, his friend is perfect. For about the thousandth time, we think about how warped Lord Henry is. Apparently, the day before, Dorian was staying out in the countryside by himself, and Henry comments that it's a lot easier to be good out there, since there's nothing to do. Dorian continues, saying that he's altered . Lord Henry demands to know what Dorian's done that's so great. Dorian tells Henry about a young girl that he met and fell in love with in the countryside. She reminded him of Sibyl Vane, and she totally fell for him. However, instead of corrupting her and destroying her life, he decided to let her go--he leaves her in her innocent state. Dorian thinks this good deed is enough to set him on the path to righteousness, despite Henry's doubts. Lord Henry continues to mock Dorian's fantasies. Dorian abruptly changes the subject, and asks Henry what's going on around town. Apparently, the gossip around their club is all about Basil--people are still discussing his disappearance. We also hear in passing that Alan Campbell committed suicide . Dorian plays it cool, and asks Henry what he thinks happened to Basil; Lord Henry's basically like, \"Screw Basil! Listen to me talk about my life.\" But Dorian doesn't want to let it go. He asks Henry if he's ever wondered if Basil was murdered--or, for that matter, if anyone else thinks that. Henry's just not that concerned; besides, he doesn't think Basil was interesting enough to get himself murdered. Dorian asks an interesting hypothetical question: what would Henry think if he said that he had killed Basil? Henry basically laughs this off, too, saying that crime is for the lower classes. He honestly just doesn't care, and even jokes that Basil probably drowned in the river Seine. Since Basil's paintings haven't been that great lately, Henry doesn't think there's anything to be sad about. Henry brings up the portrait, which he identifies as one of Basil's great works. Apparently Dorian told him that it was either lost or stolen. They discuss the painting a bit more, and Dorian confesses that he never liked it . Lord Henry changes the topic slightly to souls--what might it be like to sell one's soul? Little does he know that he's talking to the one person who knows... Dorian tells Henry that that he's sure that everyone has a soul, for better or worse. Languidly, Henry asks Dorian to play some Chopin on the piano. As Dorian plays, Henry muses at length about Dorian's youth and beauty, and his own lost youth. He tells Dorian that he's led an amazing, full life, and mistakenly praises him for still being the same. Dorian corrects him, saying that he's not the same, but Henry doesn't believe it. He thinks that Dorian is perfect. Henry goes on, saying that Dorian has always been loved by the world, even when it denounced him; he says that Dorian is the ideal of their time, and that, though he's never created anything, his whole life has been art. Dorian stops playing and tells Henry again that things are going to be different from now on. He resists Henry's praise of him. After insisting that he's going to change, Dorian reminds Lord Henry that the older man poisoned him with the yellow book, all those years ago. Henry doesn't buy it, saying that art doesn't influence real life. Dorian says his goodbyes and extricates himself from Henry, after wearily promising to see him the next day."],"next summary id":"chapters 19-20","next chapter":"Approximately six months have passed.

The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. Chapter Nineteen Several weeks have passed, it seems, and Dorian visits Lord Henry. Dorian claims that he wants to reform himself and be virtuous. As evidence of his newfound resolve, Dorian describes a recent trip to the country during which he passed up an opportunity to seduce and defile an innkeeper's innocent daughter. Lord Henry dismisses Dorian's intentions to reform, and he turns the conversation to other subjects--Alan Campbell's recent suicide and the continued mystery of Basil Hallward's disappearance. Dorian asks if Lord Henry has ever considered that Basil might have been murdered. Lord Henry dismisses the idea, noting that Basil lacked enemies. Dorian then asks: \\\"What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?\\\" Lord Henry laughs and responds that murder is too vulgar for a man like Dorian. The conversation drifts away from Basil. Lord Henry then asks Dorian, \\\"'hat does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose'--how does the quotation run?--'his own soul'?\\\" Dorian starts nervously; Lord Henry explains that he heard a street preacher posing this question to a crowd. He mocks the man in his typical fashion, but Dorian cuts him short, insisting that the soul is very real. Lord Henry laughs at the suggestion, wondering aloud how Dorian has managed to remain so young after all these years. He wishes he knew Dorian's secret and praises Dorian's life as being \\\"exquisite.\\\" He commends Dorian's mode of living and begs him not to spoil it by trying to be virtuous. Dorian somberly asks his friend not to loan anyone else the \\\"yellow book,\\\" which has had such a corrupting effect upon his own character, but Lord Henry discounts his \\\"moraliz\\\" and remarks that \\\"rt has no influence upon action. . . . The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.\\\" Before leaving, Lord Henry invites Dorian to visit him the next day. Chapter Twenty That night, Dorian goes to the locked room to look at his portrait. He hopes his decision to amend his life will have changed the painting, and he considers that perhaps his decision not to ruin the innkeeper's daughter's reputation will be reflected in the painted face. But when Dorian looks at his portrait, he sees there is no change--except that \\\"in the eyes there was a look of cunning, and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.\\\" He realizes his pitiful attempt to be good was no more than hypocrisy, an attempt to minimize the seriousness of his crimes that falls far short of atonement. Furious, he seizes a knife--the same weapon with which he killed Basil--and drives it into the portrait in an attempt to destroy it. From below, Dorian's servants hear a cry and a clatter. Breaking into the room, they see the portrait, unharmed, showing Dorian Gray as a beautiful young man. On the floor is the body of an old man, horribly wrinkled and disfigured, with a knife plunged into his heart. It is not until the servants examine the rings on the old man's hands that they identify him as Dorian Gray.\", \"analysis\": \"The contrast between Lord Henry and Dorian in Chapter Nineteen is instructive. When the novel begins, Lord Henry appears as a figure of worldly wisdom who seduces the naive Dorian with fawning compliments and a celebration of selfishness and hedonism. Now that Dorian has actually lived the philosophy that Lord Henry so eloquently champions, however, he stands as proof of the limitations--indeed, even the misguided notions--of that philosophy. In the novel's final pages, Dorian is world-weary and borne down by the weight of his sins, while Lord Henry seems almost childishly naive as he repeats his long-held but poorly informed beliefs. When Dorian all but confesses to Basil's murder, Lord Henry flippantly dismisses him, since his worldview holds that \\\"rime belongs exclusively to the lower orders.\\\" Only Lord Henry, who has never actually done any of the things he has inspired Dorian to do, could have the luxury of this thought. By keeping himself free from sin, even as he argues the virtues of sinning, Lord Henry lacks the terrible awareness of guilt and its debilitating effects. While the street preacher's rhetorical question about earthly gain at the cost of spiritual loss  haunts Dorian, it holds no real meaning for Lord Henry. At this stage, however, not even truthful self-awareness is enough to save Dorian. In his final moments, he attempts to repent the murder of Basil, the suicides of Sibyl Vane and Alan Campbell, and his countless other sins by refraining from seducing and ruining a naive village girl. The discrepancy between the enormity of his crimes and this minor act of contrition is too great. Furthermore, he realizes that he does not want to confess his sins but rather have them simply go away. The portrait reflects this hypocrisy and drives him to his final, desperate act. He decides it is better to destroy the last evidence of his sin--the painting of his soul--than face up to his own depravity. The depravity he seeks to destroy is, in essence, himself; therefore, by killing it, he kills himself. The end of the novel suggests a number of possible interpretations of Dorian's death. It may be his punishment for living the life of a hedonist, and for prizing beauty too highly, in which case the novel would be a criticism of the philosophy of aestheticism. But it is just as possible that Dorian is suffering for having violated the creeds of aestheticism. In other words, one can argue that Dorian's belief that his portrait reflects the state of his soul violates the principles of aestheticism, since, within that philosophy, art has no moral component. This reading is more in keeping with Wilde's personal philosophies and with the events of his life. In fact, elements of The Picture of Dorian Gray have an almost prophetic ring to them. Like Basil Hallward, Wilde would meet a tragic end brought about by his unrestrained worship of a beautiful young man. Additionally, like Alan Campbell, whom Dorian blackmails with vague threats of exposed secrets, Wilde would be punished for sexual indiscretions. Given the public nature of Wilde's trial and entire life--he was, in many ways, the first celebrity personality--it is impossible to ignore these parallels while reading The Picture of Dorian Gray. In De Profundis, Wilde's long letter to his lover, written from prison, he admits the limitations of the modes of thought and living that structured his life:  I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease. I amused myself with being a flaneur, a dandy; a man of fashion. . . . Tired of being on the heights, I deliberately went to the depths in the search for new sensation. What the paradox was to me in the sphere of thought, perversity became to me in the sphere of passion. Desire, at the end, was malady, or a madness, or both. I grew careless of the lives of others, I took pleasure where it pleased me, and passed on. I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character, and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber one has someday to cry aloud on the house-tops. I ceased to be lord over myself. I was no longer the captain of my soul, and did not know it. I allowed pleasure to dominate me. I ended in horrible disgrace.  The philosophy that The Picture of Dorian Gray proposes can be extremely seductive and liberating. But Wilde's words here reveal that society, conscience, or more likely both together ultimately make living that philosophy extremely difficult and even painful.\"}","chapter":"\n\"There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,\" cried\nLord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled\nwith rose-water. \"You are quite perfect.

One is by being cultured, the\nother by being corrupt.

I\nthink I have altered.\"\n\n\"You have not yet told me what your good action was.

Of course, she cried and all that.  But\nthere is no disgrace upon her.  She can live, like Perdita, in her\ngarden of mint and marigold.\"\n\n\"And weep over a faithless Florizel,\" said Lord Henry, laughing, as he\nleaned back in his chair.  \"My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously\nboyish moods.  Do you think this girl will ever be really content now\nwith any one of her own rank?  I suppose she will be married some day\nto a rough carter or a grinning ploughman.  Well, the fact of having\nmet you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she\nwill be wretched.  From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I\nthink much of your great renunciation.  Even as a beginning, it is\npoor.  Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the\npresent moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies\nround her, like Ophelia?\"\n\n\"I can't bear this, Harry!  You mock at everything, and then suggest\nthe most serious tragedies.  I am sorry I told you now.  I don't care\nwhat you say to me.  I know I was right in acting as I did.  Poor\nHetty!  As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at\nthe window, like a spray of jasmine.  Don't let us talk about it any\nmore, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have\ndone for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever\nknown, is really a sort of sin.  I want to be better.  I am going to be\nbetter.  Tell me something about yourself.  What is going on in town?\nI have not been to the club for days.\"\n\n\"The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance.\"\n\n\"I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,\" said\nDorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.\n\n\"My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and\nthe British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having\nmore than one topic every three months.  They have been very fortunate\nlately, however.  They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell's\nsuicide.  Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.\nScotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left\nfor Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor\nBasil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris\nat all.  I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has\nbeen seen in San Francisco.  It is an odd thing, but every one who\ndisappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.  It must be a\ndelightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.\"\n\n\"What do you think has happened to Basil?\" asked Dorian, holding up his\nBurgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could\ndiscuss the matter so calmly.\n\n\"I have not the slightest idea.  If Basil chooses to hide himself, it\nis no business of mine.  If he is dead, I don't want to think about\nhim.  Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me.  I hate it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said the younger man wearily.\n\n\"Because,\" said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt\ntrellis of an open vinaigrette box, \"one can survive everything\nnowadays except that.  Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in\nthe nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.  Let us have our\ncoffee in the music-room, Dorian.  You must play Chopin to me.  The man\nwith whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.  Poor Victoria!\nI was very fond of her.  The house is rather lonely without her.  Of\ncourse, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit.  But then one\nregrets the loss even of one's worst habits.  Perhaps one regrets them\nthe most.  They are such an essential part of one's personality.\"\n\nDorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next\nroom, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white\nand black ivory of the keys.  After the coffee had been brought in, he\nstopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, \"Harry, did it ever\noccur to you that Basil was murdered?\"\n\nLord Henry yawned.  \"Basil was very popular, and always wore a\nWaterbury watch.  Why should he have been murdered?  He was not clever\nenough to have enemies.  Of course, he had a wonderful genius for\npainting.  But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as\npossible.  Basil was really rather dull.  He only interested me once,\nand that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration\nfor you and that you were the dominant motive of his art.\"\n\n\"I was very fond of Basil,\" said Dorian with a note of sadness in his\nvoice.  \"But don't people say that he was murdered?\"\n\n\"Oh, some of the papers do.  It does not seem to me to be at all\nprobable.  I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not\nthe sort of man to have gone to them.  He had no curiosity.  It was his\nchief defect.\"\n\n\"What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?\"\nsaid the younger man.  He watched him intently after he had spoken.\n\n\"I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that\ndoesn't suit you.  All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.\nIt is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder.  I am sorry if I hurt\nyour vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true.  Crime belongs\nexclusively to the lower orders.  I don't blame them in the smallest\ndegree.  I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us,\nsimply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.\"\n\n\"A method of procuring sensations?  Do you think, then, that a man who\nhas once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?\nDon't tell me that.\"\n\n\"Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,\" cried Lord\nHenry, laughing.  \"That is one of the most important secrets of life.\nI should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake.  One should\nnever do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.  But let us\npass from poor Basil.  I wish I could believe that he had come to such\na really romantic end as you suggest, but I can't. I dare say he fell\ninto the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the\nscandal.  Yes:  I should fancy that was his end.  I see him lying now\non his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges\nfloating over him and long weeds catching in his hair.  Do you know, I\ndon't think he would have done much more good work.  During the last\nten years his painting had gone off very much.\"\n\nDorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began\nto stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged\nbird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo\nperch.  As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf\nof crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards\nand forwards.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of\nhis pocket; \"his painting had quite gone off.  It seemed to me to have\nlost something.  It had lost an ideal.  When you and he ceased to be\ngreat friends, he ceased to be a great artist.  What was it separated\nyou?  I suppose he bored you.  If so, he never forgave you.  It's a\nhabit bores have.  By the way, what has become of that wonderful\nportrait he did of you?  I don't think I have ever seen it since he\nfinished it.  Oh!  I remember your telling me years ago that you had\nsent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the\nway.  You never got it back?  What a pity! it was really a\nmasterpiece.  I remember I wanted to buy it.  I wish I had now.  It\nbelonged to Basil's best period.  Since then, his work was that curious\nmixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man\nto be called a representative British artist.  Did you advertise for\nit?  You should.\"\n\n\"I forget,\" said Dorian.  \"I suppose I did.  But I never really liked\nit.  I am sorry I sat for it.  The memory of the thing is hateful to\nme.  Why do you talk of it?  It used to remind me of those curious\nlines in some play--Hamlet, I think--how do they run?--\n\n    \"Like the painting of a sorrow,\n     A face without a heart.\"\n\nYes:  that is what it was like.\"\n\nLord Henry laughed.  \"If a man treats life artistically, his brain is\nhis heart,\" he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.\n\nDorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.\n\"'Like the painting of a sorrow,'\" he repeated, \"'a face without a\nheart.'\"\n\nThe elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.  \"By\nthe way, Dorian,\" he said after a pause, \"'what does it profit a man if\nhe gain the whole world and lose--how does the quotation run?--his own\nsoul'?\"\n\nThe music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.\n\"Why do you ask me that, Harry?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,\n\"I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.\nThat is all.  I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by\nthe Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people\nlistening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the\nman yelling out that question to his audience.  It struck me as being\nrather dramatic.  London is very rich in curious effects of that kind.\nA wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly\nwhite faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful\nphrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips--it was really very\ngood in its way, quite a suggestion.  I thought of telling the prophet\nthat art had a soul, but that man had not.  I am afraid, however, he\nwould not have understood me.\"\n\n\"Don't, Harry.  The soul is a terrible reality.  It can be bought, and\nsold, and bartered away.  It can be poisoned, or made perfect.  There\nis a soul in each one of us.  I know it.\"\n\n\"Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Ah! then it must be an illusion.  The things one feels absolutely\ncertain about are never true.  That is the fatality of faith, and the\nlesson of romance.  How grave you are!  Don't be so serious.  What have\nyou or I to do with the superstitions of our age?  No:  we have given\nup our belief in the soul.  Play me something.  Play me a nocturne,\nDorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept\nyour youth.  You must have some secret.  I am only ten years older than\nyou are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow.  You are really\nwonderful, Dorian.  You have never looked more charming than you do\nto-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first.  You were rather\ncheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.  You have changed, of\ncourse, but not in appearance.  I wish you would tell me your secret.\nTo get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take\nexercise, get up early, or be respectable.  Youth!  There is nothing\nlike it.  It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth.  The only\npeople to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much\nyounger than myself.  They seem in front of me.  Life has revealed to\nthem her latest wonder.  As for the aged, I always contradict the aged.\nI do it on principle.  If you ask them their opinion on something that\nhappened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in\n1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew\nabsolutely nothing.  How lovely that thing you are playing is!  I\nwonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the\nvilla and the salt spray dashing against the panes?  It is marvellously\nromantic.  What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that\nis not imitative!  Don't stop.  I want music to-night. It seems to me\nthat you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you.\nI have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of.  The\ntragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.  I am\namazed sometimes at my own sincerity.  Ah, Dorian, how happy you are!\nWhat an exquisite life you have had!  You have drunk deeply of\neverything.  You have crushed the grapes against your palate.  Nothing\nhas been hidden from you.  And it has all been to you no more than the\nsound of music.  It has not marred you.  You are still the same.\"\n\n\"I am not the same, Harry.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are the same.  I wonder what the rest of your life will be.\nDon't spoil it by renunciations.  At present you are a perfect type.\nDon't make yourself incomplete.  You are quite flawless now.  You need\nnot shake your head:  you know you are.  Besides, Dorian, don't deceive\nyourself.  Life is not governed by will or intention.  Life is a\nquestion of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which\nthought hides itself and passion has its dreams.  You may fancy\nyourself safe and think yourself strong.  But a chance tone of colour\nin a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once\nloved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten\npoem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music\nthat you had ceased to play--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things\nlike these that our lives depend.  Browning writes about that\nsomewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us.  There are\nmoments when the odour of _lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I\nhave to live the strangest month of my life over again.  I wish I could\nchange places with you, Dorian.  The world has cried out against us\nboth, but it has always worshipped you.  It always will worship you.\nYou are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is\nafraid it has found.  I am so glad that you have never done anything,\nnever carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything\noutside of yourself!  Life has been your art.  You have set yourself to\nmusic.  Your days are your sonnets.\"\n\nDorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.\n\"Yes, life has been exquisite,\" he murmured, \"but I am not going to\nhave the same life, Harry.  And you must not say these extravagant\nthings to me.  You don't know everything about me.  I think that if you\ndid, even you would turn from me.  You laugh.  Don't laugh.\"\n\n\"Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?  Go back and give me the\nnocturne over again.  Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that\nhangs in the dusky air.  She is waiting for you to charm her, and if\nyou play she will come closer to the earth.  You won't?  Let us go to\nthe club, then.  It has been a charming evening, and we must end it\ncharmingly.  There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know\nyou--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son.  He has already copied\nyour neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you.  He is quite\ndelightful and rather reminds me of you.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes.  \"But I am tired\nto-night, Harry.  I shan't go to the club.  It is nearly eleven, and I\nwant to go to bed early.\"\n\n\"Do stay.  You have never played so well as to-night. There was\nsomething in your touch that was wonderful.  It had more expression\nthan I had ever heard from it before.\"\n\n\"It is because I am going to be good,\" he answered, smiling.  \"I am a\nlittle changed already.\"\n\n\"You cannot change to me, Dorian,\" said Lord Henry.  \"You and I will\nalways be friends.\"\n\n\"Yet you poisoned me with a book once.  I should not forgive that.\nHarry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one.  It\ndoes harm.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize.  You will soon be\ngoing about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people\nagainst all the sins of which you have grown tired.  You are much too\ndelightful to do that.  Besides, it is no use.  You and I are what we\nare, and will be what we will be.  As for being poisoned by a book,\nthere is no such thing as that.  Art has no influence upon action.  It\nannihilates the desire to act.  It is superbly sterile.  The books that\nthe world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.\nThat is all.  But we won't discuss literature.  Come round to-morrow. I\nam going to ride at eleven.  We might go together, and I will take you\nto lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome.  She is a charming woman, and\nwants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.\nMind you come.  Or shall we lunch with our little duchess?  She says\nshe never sees you now.  Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?  I thought\nyou would be.  Her clever tongue gets on one's nerves.  Well, in any\ncase, be here at eleven.\"\n\n\"Must I really come, Harry?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  The park is quite lovely now.  I don't think there have\nbeen such lilacs since the year I met you.\"\n\n\"Very well.  I shall be here at eleven,\" said Dorian.  \"Good night,\nHarry.\"  As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he\nhad something more to say.  Then he sighed and went out.\n\n\n\nIt was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and\ndid not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled home,\nsmoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.  He\nheard one of them whisper to the other, \"That is Dorian Gray.\" He\nremembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared\nat, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing his own name now.  Half\nthe charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was\nthat no one knew who he was.  He had often told the girl whom he had\nlured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.  He had\ntold her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and\nanswered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.  What a\nlaugh she had!--just like a thrush singing.  And how pretty she had\nbeen in her cotton dresses and her large hats!  She knew nothing, but\nshe had everything that he had lost.\n\nWhen he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He sent\nhim to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and\nbegan to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\n\nWas it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild longing\nfor the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as\nLord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had tarnished himself,\nfilled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he\nhad been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible\njoy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had\nbeen the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to\nshame.  But was it all irretrievable?  Was there no hope for him?\n\nAh! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that\nthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the\nunsullied splendour of eternal youth!  All his failure had been due to\nthat.  Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure\nswift penalty along with it.  There was purification in punishment.\nNot \"Forgive us our sins\" but \"Smite us for our iniquities\" should be\nthe prayer of man to a most just God.\n\nThe curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many\nyears ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids\nlaughed round it as of old.  He took it up, as he had done on that\nnight of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal\npicture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished\nshield.  Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a\nmad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: \"The world is changed\nbecause you are made of ivory and gold.  The curves of your lips\nrewrite history.\"  The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated\nthem over and over to himself.  Then he loathed his own beauty, and\nflinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters\nbeneath his heel.  It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty\nand the youth that he had prayed for.  But for those two things, his\nlife might have been free from stain.  His beauty had been to him but a\nmask, his youth but a mockery.  What was youth at best?  A green, an\nunripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.  Why had he\nworn its livery?  Youth had spoiled him.\n\nIt was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.  It\nwas of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  James\nVane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.  Alan Campbell\nhad shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the\nsecret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement, such as it\nwas, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.  It was\nalready waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor, indeed, was it the\ndeath of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.  It was the\nliving death of his own soul that troubled him.  Basil had painted the\nportrait that had marred his life.  He could not forgive him that.  It\nwas the portrait that had done everything.  Basil had said things to\nhim that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.  The\nmurder had been simply the madness of a moment.  As for Alan Campbell,\nhis suicide had been his own act.  He had chosen to do it.  It was\nnothing to him.\n\nA new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting\nfor.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent\nthing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would be\ngood.\n\nAs he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\nthe locked room had changed.  Surely it was not still so horrible as it\nhad been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\nevery sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of evil\nhad already gone away.  He would go and look.\n\nHe took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.  As he unbarred the\ndoor, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\nand lingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and\nthe hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\nto him.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\n\nHe went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\ndragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and\nindignation broke from him.  He could see no change, save that in the\neyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\nthe hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if\npossible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\nbrighter, and more like blood newly spilled.  Then he trembled.  Had it\nbeen merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or the\ndesire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\nlaugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\nfiner than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?  And why was the\nred stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have crept like a\nhorrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was blood on the\npainted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand\nthat had not held the knife.  Confess?  Did it mean that he was to\nconfess?  To give himself up and be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt\nthat the idea was monstrous.  Besides, even if he did confess, who\nwould believe him?  There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\nEverything belonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned\nwhat had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\nThey would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was\nhis duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public\natonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to\nearth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would cleanse him\ntill he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his shoulders.\nThe death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.  He was thinking\nof Hetty Merton.  For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul\nthat he was looking at.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there\nbeen nothing more in his renunciation than that?  There had been\nsomething more.  At least he thought so.  But who could tell? ... No.\nThere had been nothing more.  Through vanity he had spared her.  In\nhypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.  For curiosity's sake he\nhad tried the denial of self.  He recognized that now.\n\nBut this murder--was it to dog him all his life?  Was he always to be\nburdened by his past?  Was he really to confess?  Never.  There was\nonly one bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself--that\nwas evidence.  He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  Once\nit had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.  Of\nlate he had felt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night.\nWhen he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes\nshould look upon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions.\nIts mere memory had marred many moments of joy.  It had been like\nconscience to him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.\n\nHe looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.  He\nhad cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.  It\nwas bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it would\nkill the painter's work, and all that that meant.  It would kill the\npast, and when that was dead, he would be free.  It would kill this\nmonstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at\npeace.  He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\n\nThere was a cry heard, and a crash.  The cry was so horrible in its\nagony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\nTwo gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\nup at the great house.  They walked on till they met a policeman and\nbrought him back.  The man rang the bell several times, but there was\nno answer.  Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was\nall dark.  After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico\nand watched.\n\n\"Whose house is that, Constable?\" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\n\n\"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,\" answered the policeman.\n\nThey looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.  One of\nthem was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.\n\nInside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics\nwere talking in low whispers to each other.  Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\nand wringing her hands.  Francis was as pale as death.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\nfootmen and crept upstairs.  They knocked, but there was no reply.\nThey called out.  Everything was still.  Finally, after vainly trying\nto force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the\nbalcony.  The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old.\n\nWhen they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\nof their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\nexquisite youth and beauty.  Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\nevening dress, with a knife in his heart.  He was withered, wrinkled,\nand loathsome of visage.  It was not till they had examined the rings\nthat they recognized who it was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":5436.0,"summary_name":"Chapters Nineteen-Twenty","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210228142327\/https:\/\/www.sparknotes.com\/lit\/doriangray\/section10\/","summary_text":"Art has no influence upon action. . . . The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. Chapter Nineteen Several weeks have passed, it seems, and Dorian visits Lord Henry. Dorian claims that he wants to reform himself and be virtuous. As evidence of his newfound resolve, Dorian describes a recent trip to the country during which he passed up an opportunity to seduce and defile an innkeeper's innocent daughter. Lord Henry dismisses Dorian's intentions to reform, and he turns the conversation to other subjects--Alan Campbell's recent suicide and the continued mystery of Basil Hallward's disappearance. Dorian asks if Lord Henry has ever considered that Basil might have been murdered. Lord Henry dismisses the idea, noting that Basil lacked enemies. Dorian then asks: \"What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?\" Lord Henry laughs and responds that murder is too vulgar for a man like Dorian. The conversation drifts away from Basil. Lord Henry then asks Dorian, \"'hat does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose'--how does the quotation run?--'his own soul'?\" Dorian starts nervously; Lord Henry explains that he heard a street preacher posing this question to a crowd. He mocks the man in his typical fashion, but Dorian cuts him short, insisting that the soul is very real. Lord Henry laughs at the suggestion, wondering aloud how Dorian has managed to remain so young after all these years. He wishes he knew Dorian's secret and praises Dorian's life as being \"exquisite.\" He commends Dorian's mode of living and begs him not to spoil it by trying to be virtuous. Dorian somberly asks his friend not to loan anyone else the \"yellow book,\" which has had such a corrupting effect upon his own character, but Lord Henry discounts his \"moraliz\" and remarks that \"rt has no influence upon action. . . . The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.\" Before leaving, Lord Henry invites Dorian to visit him the next day. Chapter Twenty That night, Dorian goes to the locked room to look at his portrait. He hopes his decision to amend his life will have changed the painting, and he considers that perhaps his decision not to ruin the innkeeper's daughter's reputation will be reflected in the painted face. But when Dorian looks at his portrait, he sees there is no change--except that \"in the eyes there was a look of cunning, and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.\" He realizes his pitiful attempt to be good was no more than hypocrisy, an attempt to minimize the seriousness of his crimes that falls far short of atonement. Furious, he seizes a knife--the same weapon with which he killed Basil--and drives it into the portrait in an attempt to destroy it. From below, Dorian's servants hear a cry and a clatter. Breaking into the room, they see the portrait, unharmed, showing Dorian Gray as a beautiful young man. On the floor is the body of an old man, horribly wrinkled and disfigured, with a knife plunged into his heart. It is not until the servants examine the rings on the old man's hands that they identify him as Dorian Gray.","summary_analysis":"The contrast between Lord Henry and Dorian in Chapter Nineteen is instructive. When the novel begins, Lord Henry appears as a figure of worldly wisdom who seduces the naive Dorian with fawning compliments and a celebration of selfishness and hedonism. Now that Dorian has actually lived the philosophy that Lord Henry so eloquently champions, however, he stands as proof of the limitations--indeed, even the misguided notions--of that philosophy. In the novel's final pages, Dorian is world-weary and borne down by the weight of his sins, while Lord Henry seems almost childishly naive as he repeats his long-held but poorly informed beliefs. When Dorian all but confesses to Basil's murder, Lord Henry flippantly dismisses him, since his worldview holds that \"rime belongs exclusively to the lower orders.\" Only Lord Henry, who has never actually done any of the things he has inspired Dorian to do, could have the luxury of this thought. By keeping himself free from sin, even as he argues the virtues of sinning, Lord Henry lacks the terrible awareness of guilt and its debilitating effects. While the street preacher's rhetorical question about earthly gain at the cost of spiritual loss  haunts Dorian, it holds no real meaning for Lord Henry. At this stage, however, not even truthful self-awareness is enough to save Dorian. In his final moments, he attempts to repent the murder of Basil, the suicides of Sibyl Vane and Alan Campbell, and his countless other sins by refraining from seducing and ruining a naive village girl. The discrepancy between the enormity of his crimes and this minor act of contrition is too great. Furthermore, he realizes that he does not want to confess his sins but rather have them simply go away. The portrait reflects this hypocrisy and drives him to his final, desperate act. He decides it is better to destroy the last evidence of his sin--the painting of his soul--than face up to his own depravity. The depravity he seeks to destroy is, in essence, himself; therefore, by killing it, he kills himself. The end of the novel suggests a number of possible interpretations of Dorian's death. It may be his punishment for living the life of a hedonist, and for prizing beauty too highly, in which case the novel would be a criticism of the philosophy of aestheticism. But it is just as possible that Dorian is suffering for having violated the creeds of aestheticism. In other words, one can argue that Dorian's belief that his portrait reflects the state of his soul violates the principles of aestheticism, since, within that philosophy, art has no moral component. This reading is more in keeping with Wilde's personal philosophies and with the events of his life. In fact, elements of The Picture of Dorian Gray have an almost prophetic ring to them. Like Basil Hallward, Wilde would meet a tragic end brought about by his unrestrained worship of a beautiful young man. Additionally, like Alan Campbell, whom Dorian blackmails with vague threats of exposed secrets, Wilde would be punished for sexual indiscretions. Given the public nature of Wilde's trial and entire life--he was, in many ways, the first celebrity personality--it is impossible to ignore these parallels while reading The Picture of Dorian Gray. In De Profundis, Wilde's long letter to his lover, written from prison, he admits the limitations of the modes of thought and living that structured his life:  I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease. I amused myself with being a flaneur, a dandy; a man of fashion. . . . Tired of being on the heights, I deliberately went to the depths in the search for new sensation. What the paradox was to me in the sphere of thought, perversity became to me in the sphere of passion. Desire, at the end, was malady, or a madness, or both. I grew careless of the lives of others, I took pleasure where it pleased me, and passed on. I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character, and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber one has someday to cry aloud on the house-tops. I ceased to be lord over myself. I was no longer the captain of my soul, and did not know it. I allowed pleasure to dominate me. I ended in horrible disgrace.  The philosophy that The Picture of Dorian Gray proposes can be extremely seductive and liberating. But Wilde's words here reveal that society, conscience, or more likely both together ultimately make living that philosophy extremely difficult and even painful.","summary_length":552.0,"analysis_length":768.0,"chap_int":20,"previous summary id":["chapter 19","chapter 19"],"previous chapter":["Several months later, Dorian is back in London, conversing with Lord Henry at the older man's house. Dorian, it seems, has decided to change his ways. Henry tells him that he is perfect the way he is and that there's no use trying to change, but Dorian replies that \"I have done too many dreadful things in my life,\" and that \"I began my good actions yesterday.\" His so-called \"good action\" was his treatment of Hetty, a beautiful young peasant girl who reminded him of Sibyl Vane. She fell in love with Dorian, but instead of taking advantage of her and breaking her heart, as was his usual way, he \"determined to leave her as flower-like as had found her.\" Henry mocks him and asks whether he's sure that Hetty \"isn't floating at the present moment in some star-lit millpond...like Ophelia.\" This upsets Dorian, as he desperately wants to believe in the value of his good intentions. The conversation turns towards the whereabouts of Basil Hallward. The painter's disappearance, now six weeks old, is still the talk of the town, along with Henry's divorce and the suicide of Alan Campbell. Henry asks Dorian to play Chopin for him, because \"The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.\" At the piano, Dorian nonchalantly asks what Henry would think if he told him that he had murdered Basil. \"I would say,\" he responds, \"that you were posing for a character that didn't suit you.\" Such crimes, Henry believes, are the specialty of the lower classes. Besides, Henry cannot imagine that Basil would have met such a romantic end, because his paintings had steadily declined in the years following his soiled friendship with Dorian. His painting of Dorian was, apparently, his final masterpiece. Henry believes that the painting was stolen a long time ago, and Dorian claims to have forgotten all about it. Henry catches Dorian off-guard by paraphrasing the Bible, asking him: \"what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose...his soul?\" When Dorian is startled by this statement, Henry just laughs, telling him that he heard a preacher posing this quesiton to a crowd during a walk through the park on a rainy day. Henry describes his amusement at the spectacle of the somber crowd standing in the rain, listening to \"an uncouth Christian in a macintosh.\" He apparently wanted to tell the preacher that \"Art had a soul, but that man did not.\" Henry's light-heartedness offends Dorian, who says that \"The soul is a terrible reality...It can be poisoned or made perfect.\" He tells Henry that he is certain of this fact, to which Henry replies, \"then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true.\" Dorian begins to play a nocturne by Chopin, which greatly affects Henry and prompts a rambling tirade on romance and how exquisite Dorian's life has been. Dorian agrees, but reminds Henry that he has turned over a new leaf, and that he will never forgive him for his corrupting influence. On his way out, Henry invites Dorian to lunch the next day, and Dorian reluctantly agrees to accompany the older man.","This whole James Vane incident seems to have shaken Dorian significantly. Back in London, he informs Lord Henry that he's going to become a good person again. Henry doesn't believe it, nor does he think Dorian should change at all. In his view, his friend is perfect. For about the thousandth time, we think about how warped Lord Henry is. Apparently, the day before, Dorian was staying out in the countryside by himself, and Henry comments that it's a lot easier to be good out there, since there's nothing to do. Dorian continues, saying that he's altered . Lord Henry demands to know what Dorian's done that's so great. Dorian tells Henry about a young girl that he met and fell in love with in the countryside. She reminded him of Sibyl Vane, and she totally fell for him. However, instead of corrupting her and destroying her life, he decided to let her go--he leaves her in her innocent state. Dorian thinks this good deed is enough to set him on the path to righteousness, despite Henry's doubts. Lord Henry continues to mock Dorian's fantasies. Dorian abruptly changes the subject, and asks Henry what's going on around town. Apparently, the gossip around their club is all about Basil--people are still discussing his disappearance. We also hear in passing that Alan Campbell committed suicide . Dorian plays it cool, and asks Henry what he thinks happened to Basil; Lord Henry's basically like, \"Screw Basil! Listen to me talk about my life.\" But Dorian doesn't want to let it go. He asks Henry if he's ever wondered if Basil was murdered--or, for that matter, if anyone else thinks that. Henry's just not that concerned; besides, he doesn't think Basil was interesting enough to get himself murdered. Dorian asks an interesting hypothetical question: what would Henry think if he said that he had killed Basil? Henry basically laughs this off, too, saying that crime is for the lower classes. He honestly just doesn't care, and even jokes that Basil probably drowned in the river Seine. Since Basil's paintings haven't been that great lately, Henry doesn't think there's anything to be sad about. Henry brings up the portrait, which he identifies as one of Basil's great works. Apparently Dorian told him that it was either lost or stolen. They discuss the painting a bit more, and Dorian confesses that he never liked it . Lord Henry changes the topic slightly to souls--what might it be like to sell one's soul? Little does he know that he's talking to the one person who knows... Dorian tells Henry that that he's sure that everyone has a soul, for better or worse. Languidly, Henry asks Dorian to play some Chopin on the piano. As Dorian plays, Henry muses at length about Dorian's youth and beauty, and his own lost youth. He tells Dorian that he's led an amazing, full life, and mistakenly praises him for still being the same. Dorian corrects him, saying that he's not the same, but Henry doesn't believe it. He thinks that Dorian is perfect. Henry goes on, saying that Dorian has always been loved by the world, even when it denounced him; he says that Dorian is the ideal of their time, and that, though he's never created anything, his whole life has been art. Dorian stops playing and tells Henry again that things are going to be different from now on. He resists Henry's praise of him. After insisting that he's going to change, Dorian reminds Lord Henry that the older man poisoned him with the yellow book, all those years ago. Henry doesn't buy it, saying that art doesn't influence real life. Dorian says his goodbyes and extricates himself from Henry, after wearily promising to see him the next day."],"next summary id":"chapters 19-20","next chapter":"Art has no influence upon action. . . . The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. Chapter Nineteen Several weeks have passed, it seems, and Dorian visits Lord Henry. Dorian claims that he wants to reform himself and be virtuous. As evidence of his newfound resolve, Dorian describes a recent trip to the country during which he passed up an opportunity to seduce and defile an innkeeper's innocent daughter. Lord Henry dismisses Dorian's intentions to reform, and he turns the conversation to other subjects--Alan Campbell's recent suicide and the continued mystery of Basil Hallward's disappearance. Dorian asks if Lord Henry has ever considered that Basil might have been murdered. Lord Henry dismisses the idea, noting that Basil lacked enemies.

In the battle, Brown was almost paralyzed by fear. The numbers were 200 to one. Fear among the people, however, had also begun to unravel the social fabric. One of Brown's men is shot down, so Brown shoots one of the Bugis three times in the stomach. Then, sounds of joy lift in the air. Cornelius tells Brown that Jim has returned, not afraid of anything. When Brown sees Jim, he sees a man in European clothes, all in white, with a helmet. The two meet near the very spot where Jim had taken \\\"the second desperate leap of his life--the leap that landed him into the life of Patusan, into the trust, the love, the confidence of the people\\\" . Brown hates Jim on sight--for his youth and his assurance, his self-possession, his power and neatness. They converse, and Brown yells to him that it was hunger that had driven him to Patusan. Why had Jim come? The conversation strikes Marlow as a duel, and as if Brown, like a great man, had discovered Jim's weakest spot. He says, \\\"if it came to saving one's life in the dark, one didn't care who else went--three, thirty, three hundred people\\\" . Jim says nothing in response, and he is struck by \\\"their common blood, an assumption of common experience; a sickening suggestion of common guilt, of secret knowledge that was like a bond of their minds and of their hearts\\\" . With that, Jim turns away, telling Brown he will have a clear road or a clear fight . The story now continues from Tamb' Itam's point of view. He describes the shock of Jim insisting that Dain Waris lead. Tamb' Itam is given the duty of sending word to Dain Waris to let Brown and his men pass. Jim includes Stein's silver ring as a sign of good faith and, at the same time, he sends Brown a note with Cornelius as messenger. The note says, \\\"You get the clear road\\\" . But, upon delivering the note, Cornelius remains with Brown and tells him that Dain Waris's party is downriver and lying in wait to lay ambush on him as they pass. Brown feels betrayed yet, strangely enough, he doesn't seem to believe it. To be safe, he takes the creek he had noticed upon his first arrival. Through the fog, he takes Cornelius with him in the longboat. After Tamb' Itam approaches Dain Waris's camp and delivers the message with the ring, saying that all is well and that the trouble has passed, Dain Waris slips the ring onto the forefinger of his right hand. Brown's men land nearby and, though Cornelius tries to get away, force him to lead the way to the camp. No one had imagined that the white men would know of the creek. Fourteen shots ring out, and Dain Waris jumps up, running to the open shore. There, Tamb' Itam sees a bullet hit Darin Waris's forehead, and a great fear falls upon him. The white men disappear. Tamb' Itam sees Cornelius and shoots him twice, watching him die. He then hurries back to the town, knowing that it is important that he be the first bearer of the news. When he arrives, the town is festive. He seeks out the girl and reports what has happened. They go to find Jim, and he tells Jim that it is not safe for him to go out amongst the people. This is when Jim understands that it is all over: \\\"the work of his own hands, had fallen in ruins upon his head\\\" . Marlow believes it was then that Jim had tried to write to someone. He says to Jewel, \\\"I have no life\\\" . The girl insists that either he should fight, or they should run away. But he ignores her. Dain Waris's body is brought to Doramin, and as Doramin sees the wound in the forehead and then the ring on his son's forefinger, he begins to cry in fury. Jim walks to meet him: \\\"There is nothing to fight for\\\" . He tells Doramin that he has come ready and unarmed, and that is when Doramin shoots him through the chest. Jim, with a proud and unflinching look, falls dead. The story concludes with Jewel in Stein's home, \\\"leading a sort of soundless, inert life\\\" . Stein has grown old and sorrowful. He feels himself preparing to leave \\\"all this,\\\" and he \\\"waves his hand sadly at his butterflies\\\" .\", \"analysis\": \"When Brown and Jim finally meet, Brown expresses hatred.  This hatred is, on some level, understandable.  He hates the world for never having given him the opportunity or the \\\"clean slate\\\" that Jim had been given.  When Brown and Jim face each other, each sees in the other a vision of what might have been.  The moment is one of recognition. Brown, the reader can surmise from subtle hints in the narrative, is a quick man.  He is charismatic enough to be a leader, albeit of an outcast group.  Still, his eye sees the hidden creek and, in the way that a great man senses another man's greatest weakness, Brown hits Jim in his weak spot.  He rouses in their interaction a sense of challenge.  Jim, now the embodiment of a mythical romantic ideal, begins to collapse.  The reason is less from a worry that Brown knows who Jim than the realization  that Jim will never be able to escape his moment of weakness on the Patna: his choice is part of his character, and his history is an integral part of his personality.  This history is not knowledge that is external to him, but something that has become deeply seated in his being.  Brown is a personification of that hidden and rejected self-knowledge. Jim likewise recognizes that Brown is a man who has potential or \\\"Ability in the abstract.\\\" In an attempt to pass along to him an opportunity in the same generous spirit with which Stein and Marlow had aided him, Jim gives Brown \\\"the clear road\\\"--not quite a clean slate, but a chance to achieve his goals.  This is an opportunity for Brown, though it is not nearly of the same quality as the one that had been given to Jim, because the clear road does not promise a realization of the romantic ideal, the achievement of the dreams of a life of glory and honor.  Instead, it is an opportunity for Brown to persist in his merely Darwinian-style struggle to survive.  The lesser opportunity here, however, is perhaps not so much a result of individual potential and character as it is a product of fortune or chance. The tragic conclusion ensues in a fog of mistrust.  Cornelius presses Brown to see the possibility of betrayal, though there is something in Brown that recognizes \\\"that there could be no treachery intended\\\" .  Brown is an astute judge of character.  Still, in the end, he acts mistrustful all the same, choosing to be retaliatory and violent.  These actions do more to reveal the true nature of his character.  Up the creek, and in secret, he wreaks havoc and death among Dain Waris's camp, and then escapes quickly. We again meet fairly clear evidence of Brown's character, should the story be true, that he is found at sea in a lifeboat telling the same story that the Patna crew had told their rescuers: the ship had sunk beneath their feet.  The irony in this tale, however, is that Jim had been one of them, as well as \\\"one of us.\\\"  Can Jim exorcise from himself the negative spirit that persists in Brown?  The ambiguity of character suggests that all men are mixtures of potential characters: the romantic, the hopeless, the corrupt, and the cowardly.  \\\"One of us\\\" can refer to being one more such complex being within the company of all men. As for Jim's fate, Dain Waris's death extinguishes the flame that had charmed the life of Patusan.  This parallel to Stein's best friend being assassinated is obvious, though in Jim's case, the death comes out of a failure of judgment on his part.  The ring, signifying the promise of good will from Stein to Doramin, becomes a symbol of betrayal.  Additionally, the death causes Jim's reputation and secure place in Patusan society to begin to crumble.  He has no place in the world beyond, and now that his work in Patusan is finished, there is nowhere for him to go, except to be extinguished himself. Therefore, as the reader recalls the vision of Stein blowing out a flaming match with the idea that all life is fleeting, Jim is compelled to do what is logically demanded at this climax.  He cannot fight in the way Brown had--struggling for his life--because to do so would liken him further to Brown.  Instead, he leaps in the direction of his fate.  He does not fight it. Jewel, representing the love that the community had felt for Jim and the delight of opportunity he had known, is discarded.  His final atonement requires a clean break.  Jim goes to meet Doramin with a calm face, in the same way that he had arrived, in the face of possible assault.  Here, the assault is certain, and Jim dies in a manner that atones for his past failure at sea.  This time, he goes down with the iron ship as it sinks.  He does not run.  He refuses to leap for a lifeboat to share with Jewel and Tamb' Itam.  Instead he remains--as George had remained--aboard, to die. The native audience looks at Jim's body, as the Muslim pilgrims had looked upon George's, with curiosity and fascination.  The mystery man of Patusan is brought to an end.  Jim is, after all, a man who dies, in spite of the myths of his immortality.  Nevertheless, in true Conradian fashion and poetic tradition, Jim lives on through his show of action.  He remains committed to his ideal and takes responsibility for what he has done and, in this way, Marlow finishes his story.  This man's story is worth finishing.  The inquiry into Jim's soul has been mysterious but it also has been fruitful, revelatory, and illustrative of what is human. The novel concludes with a final view of an aging Stein and a broken, mute Jewel.  The ring has been lost, and there is no one to inherit what Stein has built .  For Stein, the romantic tradition comes to an end.  As his hands wave at the butterflies beneath the glass, we sense that Stein, Jewel, the butterflies, everyone, all etherized in their places, will soon disintegrate into dust.\"}","chapter":"'Brown's object was to gain time by fooling with Kassim's diplomacy. For\ndoing a real stroke of business he could not help thinking the white man\nwas the person to work with. He could not imagine such a chap (who must\nbe confoundedly clever after all to get hold of the natives like\nthat) refusing a help that would do away with the necessity for slow,\ncautious, risky cheating, that imposed itself as the only possible\nline of conduct for a single-handed man. He, Brown, would offer him\nthe power. No man could hesitate. Everything was in coming to a clear\nunderstanding. Of course they would share. The idea of there being a\nfort--all ready to his hand--a real fort, with artillery (he knew this\nfrom Cornelius), excited him. Let him only once get in and . . . He\nwould impose modest conditions. Not too low, though. The man was no\nfool, it seemed. They would work like brothers till . . . till the time\ncame for a quarrel and a shot that would settle all accounts. With grim\nimpatience of plunder he wished himself to be talking with the man now.\nThe land already seemed to be his to tear to pieces, squeeze, and throw\naway. Meantime Kassim had to be fooled for the sake of food first--and\nfor a second string. But the principal thing was to get something to eat\nfrom day to day. Besides, he was not averse to begin fighting on that\nRajah's account, and teach a lesson to those people who had received him\nwith shots. The lust of battle was upon him.\n\n'I am sorry that I can't give you this part of the story, which of\ncourse I have mainly from Brown, in Brown's own words. There was in the\nbroken, violent speech of that man, unveiling before me his thoughts\nwith the very hand of Death upon his throat, an undisguised ruthlessness\nof purpose, a strange vengeful attitude towards his own past, and a\nblind belief in the righteousness of his will against all mankind,\nsomething of that feeling which could induce the leader of a horde of\nwandering cut-throats to call himself proudly the Scourge of God.\nNo doubt the natural senseless ferocity which is the basis of such\na character was exasperated by failure, ill-luck, and the recent\nprivations, as well as by the desperate position in which he found\nhimself; but what was most remarkable of all was this, that while he\nplanned treacherous alliances, had already settled in his own mind the\nfate of the white man, and intrigued in an overbearing, offhand manner\nwith Kassim, one could perceive that what he had really desired, almost\nin spite of himself, was to play havoc with that jungle town which had\ndefied him, to see it strewn over with corpses and enveloped in flames.\nListening to his pitiless, panting voice, I could imagine how he must\nhave looked at it from the hillock, peopling it with images of murder\nand rapine. The part nearest to the creek wore an abandoned aspect,\nthough as a matter of fact every house concealed a few armed men on the\nalert. Suddenly beyond the stretch of waste ground, interspersed with\nsmall patches of low dense bush, excavations, heaps of rubbish, with\ntrodden paths between, a man, solitary and looking very small, strolled\nout into the deserted opening of the street between the shut-up, dark,\nlifeless buildings at the end. Perhaps one of the inhabitants, who had\nfled to the other bank of the river, coming back for some object of\ndomestic use. Evidently he supposed himself quite safe at that distance\nfrom the hill on the other side of the creek. A light stockade, set up\nhastily, was just round the turn of the street, full of his friends.\nHe moved leisurely. Brown saw him, and instantly called to his side the\nYankee deserter, who acted as a sort of second in command. This lanky,\nloose-jointed fellow came forward, wooden-faced, trailing his rifle\nlazily. When he understood what was wanted from him a homicidal and\nconceited smile uncovered his teeth, making two deep folds down his\nsallow, leathery cheeks. He prided himself on being a dead shot. He\ndropped on one knee, and taking aim from a steady rest through the\nunlopped branches of a felled tree, fired, and at once stood up to look.\nThe man, far away, turned his head to the report, made another step\nforward, seemed to hesitate, and abruptly got down on his hands and\nknees. In the silence that fell upon the sharp crack of the rifle, the\ndead shot, keeping his eyes fixed upon the quarry, guessed that \"this\nthere coon's health would never be a source of anxiety to his friends\nany more.\" The man's limbs were seen to move rapidly under his body\nin an endeavour to run on all-fours. In that empty space arose a\nmultitudinous shout of dismay and surprise. The man sank flat, face\ndown, and moved no more. \"That showed them what we could do,\" said Brown\nto me. \"Struck the fear of sudden death into them. That was what we\nwanted. They were two hundred to one, and this gave them something to\nthink over for the night. Not one of them had an idea of such a long\nshot before. That beggar belonging to the Rajah scooted down-hill with\nhis eyes hanging out of his head.\"\n\n'As he was telling me this he tried with a shaking hand to wipe the thin\nfoam on his blue lips. \"Two hundred to one. Two hundred to one . . .\nstrike terror, . . . terror, terror, I tell you. . . .\" His own eyes\nwere starting out of their sockets. He fell back, clawing the air with\nskinny fingers, sat up again, bowed and hairy, glared at me sideways\nlike some man-beast of folk-lore, with open mouth in his miserable and\nawful agony before he got his speech back after that fit. There are\nsights one never forgets.\n\n'Furthermore, to draw the enemy's fire and locate such parties as\nmight have been hiding in the bushes along the creek, Brown ordered the\nSolomon Islander to go down to the boat and bring an oar, as you send a\nspaniel after a stick into the water. This failed, and the fellow came\nback without a single shot having been fired at him from anywhere.\n\"There's nobody,\" opined some of the men. It is \"onnatural,\" remarked\nthe Yankee. Kassim had gone, by that time, very much impressed, pleased\ntoo, and also uneasy. Pursuing his tortuous policy, he had dispatched a\nmessage to Dain Waris warning him to look out for the white men's\nship, which, he had had information, was about to come up the river.\nHe minimised its strength and exhorted him to oppose its passage. This\ndouble-dealing answered his purpose, which was to keep the Bugis forces\ndivided and to weaken them by fighting. On the other hand, he had in\nthe course of that day sent word to the assembled Bugis chiefs in town,\nassuring them that he was trying to induce the invaders to retire; his\nmessages to the fort asked earnestly for powder for the Rajah's men. It\nwas a long time since Tunku Allang had had ammunition for the score or\nso of old muskets rusting in their arm-racks in the audience-hall.\nThe open intercourse between the hill and the palace unsettled all the\nminds. It was already time for men to take sides, it began to be said.\nThere would soon be much bloodshed, and thereafter great trouble for\nmany people. The social fabric of orderly, peaceful life, when every man\nwas sure of to-morrow, the edifice raised by Jim's hands, seemed on that\nevening ready to collapse into a ruin reeking with blood. The poorer\nfolk were already taking to the bush or flying up the river. A good many\nof the upper class judged it necessary to go and pay their court to the\nRajah. The Rajah's youths jostled them rudely. Old Tunku Allang, almost\nout of his mind with fear and indecision, either kept a sullen silence\nor abused them violently for daring to come with empty hands: they\ndeparted very much frightened; only old Doramin kept his countrymen\ntogether and pursued his tactics inflexibly. Enthroned in a big chair\nbehind the improvised stockade, he issued his orders in a deep veiled\nrumble, unmoved, like a deaf man, in the flying rumours.\n\n'Dusk fell, hiding first the body of the dead man, which had been left\nlying with arms outstretched as if nailed to the ground, and then the\nrevolving sphere of the night rolled smoothly over Patusan and came to\na rest, showering the glitter of countless worlds upon the earth. Again,\nin the exposed part of the town big fires blazed along the only street,\nrevealing from distance to distance upon their glares the falling\nstraight lines of roofs, the fragments of wattled walls jumbled in\nconfusion, here and there a whole hut elevated in the glow upon the\nvertical black stripes of a group of high piles and all this line of\ndwellings, revealed in patches by the swaying flames, seemed to flicker\ntortuously away up-river into the gloom at the heart of the land. A\ngreat silence, in which the looms of successive fires played without\nnoise, extended into the darkness at the foot of the hill; but the\nother bank of the river, all dark save for a solitary bonfire at the\nriver-front before the fort, sent out into the air an increasing tremor\nthat might have been the stamping of a multitude of feet, the hum of\nmany voices, or the fall of an immensely distant waterfall. It was\nthen, Brown confessed to me, while, turning his back on his men, he sat\nlooking at it all, that notwithstanding his disdain, his ruthless faith\nin himself, a feeling came over him that at last he had run his head\nagainst a stone wall. Had his boat been afloat at the time, he believed\nhe would have tried to steal away, taking his chances of a long chase\ndown the river and of starvation at sea. It is very doubtful whether he\nwould have succeeded in getting away. However, he didn't try this. For\nanother moment he had a passing thought of trying to rush the town,\nbut he perceived very well that in the end he would find himself in the\nlighted street, where they would be shot down like dogs from the houses.\nThey were two hundred to one--he thought, while his men, huddling round\ntwo heaps of smouldering embers, munched the last of the bananas and\nroasted the few yams they owed to Kassim's diplomacy. Cornelius sat\namongst them dozing sulkily.\n\n'Then one of the whites remembered that some tobacco had been left in\nthe boat, and, encouraged by the impunity of the Solomon Islander,\nsaid he would go to fetch it. At this all the others shook off\ntheir despondency. Brown applied to, said, \"Go, and be d--d to you,\"\nscornfully. He didn't think there was any danger in going to the creek\nin the dark. The man threw a leg over the tree-trunk and disappeared. A\nmoment later he was heard clambering into the boat and then clambering\nout. \"I've got it,\" he cried. A flash and a report at the very foot of\nthe hill followed. \"I am hit,\" yelled the man. \"Look out, look out--I am\nhit,\" and instantly all the rifles went off. The hill squirted fire\nand noise into the night like a little volcano, and when Brown and\nthe Yankee with curses and cuffs stopped the panic-stricken firing, a\nprofound, weary groan floated up from the creek, succeeded by a plaint\nwhose heartrending sadness was like some poison turning the blood\ncold in the veins. Then a strong voice pronounced several distinct\nincomprehensible words somewhere beyond the creek. \"Let no one fire,\"\nshouted Brown. \"What does it mean?\" . . . \"Do you hear on the hill?\nDo you hear? Do you hear?\" repeated the voice three times. Cornelius\ntranslated, and then prompted the answer. \"Speak,\" cried Brown, \"we\nhear.\" Then the voice, declaiming in the sonorous inflated tone of a\nherald, and shifting continually on the edge of the vague waste-land,\nproclaimed that between the men of the Bugis nation living in Patusan\nand the white men on the hill and those with them, there would be no\nfaith, no compassion, no speech, no peace. A bush rustled; a haphazard\nvolley rang out. \"Dam' foolishness,\" muttered the Yankee, vexedly\ngrounding the butt. Cornelius translated. The wounded man below\nthe hill, after crying out twice, \"Take me up! take me up!\" went on\ncomplaining in moans. While he had kept on the blackened earth of the\nslope, and afterwards crouching in the boat, he had been safe enough.\nIt seems that in his joy at finding the tobacco he forgot himself and\njumped out on her off-side, as it were. The white boat, lying high and\ndry, showed him up; the creek was no more than seven yards wide in that\nplace, and there happened to be a man crouching in the bush on the other\nbank.\n\n'He was a Bugis of Tondano only lately come to Patusan, and a relation\nof the man shot in the afternoon. That famous long shot had indeed\nappalled the beholders. The man in utter security had been struck down,\nin full view of his friends, dropping with a joke on his lips, and they\nseemed to see in the act an atrocity which had stirred a bitter rage.\nThat relation of his, Si-Lapa by name, was then with Doramin in the\nstockade only a few feet away. You who know these chaps must admit that\nthe fellow showed an unusual pluck by volunteering to carry the message,\nalone, in the dark. Creeping across the open ground, he had deviated\nto the left and found himself opposite the boat. He was startled when\nBrown's man shouted. He came to a sitting position with his gun to his\nshoulder, and when the other jumped out, exposing himself, he pulled the\ntrigger and lodged three jagged slugs point-blank into the poor wretch's\nstomach. Then, lying flat on his face, he gave himself up for dead,\nwhile a thin hail of lead chopped and swished the bushes close on his\nright hand; afterwards he delivered his speech shouting, bent double,\ndodging all the time in cover. With the last word he leaped sideways,\nlay close for a while, and afterwards got back to the houses unharmed,\nhaving achieved on that night such a renown as his children will not\nwillingly allow to die.\n\n'And on the hill the forlorn band let the two little heaps of embers\ngo out under their bowed heads. They sat dejected on the ground with\ncompressed lips and downcast eyes, listening to their comrade below. He\nwas a strong man and died hard, with moans now loud, now sinking to a\nstrange confidential note of pain. Sometimes he shrieked, and again,\nafter a period of silence, he could be heard muttering deliriously a\nlong and unintelligible complaint. Never for a moment did he cease.\n\n'\"What's the good?\" Brown had said unmoved once, seeing the Yankee, who\nhad been swearing under his breath, prepare to go down. \"That's so,\"\nassented the deserter, reluctantly desisting. \"There's no encouragement\nfor wounded men here. Only his noise is calculated to make all the\nothers think too much of the hereafter, cap'n.\" \"Water!\" cried the\nwounded man in an extraordinarily clear vigorous voice, and then went\noff moaning feebly. \"Ay, water. Water will do it,\" muttered the other to\nhimself, resignedly. \"Plenty by-and-by. The tide is flowing.\"\n\n'At last the tide flowed, silencing the plaint and the cries of pain,\nand the dawn was near when Brown, sitting with his chin in the palm of\nhis hand before Patusan, as one might stare at the unscalable side of a\nmountain, heard the brief ringing bark of a brass 6-pounder far away\nin town somewhere. \"What's this?\" he asked of Cornelius, who hung about\nhim. Cornelius listened. A muffled roaring shout rolled down-river over\nthe town; a big drum began to throb, and others responded, pulsating and\ndroning. Tiny scattered lights began to twinkle in the dark half of the\ntown, while the part lighted by the loom of fires hummed with a deep and\nprolonged murmur. \"He has come,\" said Cornelius. \"What? Already? Are\nyou sure?\" Brown asked. \"Yes! yes! Sure. Listen to the noise.\" \"What\nare they making that row about?\" pursued Brown. \"For joy,\" snorted\nCornelius; \"he is a very great man, but all the same, he knows no more\nthan a child, and so they make a great noise to please him, because they\nknow no better.\" \"Look here,\" said Brown, \"how is one to get at him?\"\n\"He shall come to talk to you,\" Cornelius declared. \"What do you mean?\nCome down here strolling as it were?\" Cornelius nodded vigorously in the\ndark. \"Yes. He will come straight here and talk to you. He is just like\na fool. You shall see what a fool he is.\" Brown was incredulous. \"You\nshall see; you shall see,\" repeated Cornelius. \"He is not afraid--not\nafraid of anything. He will come and order you to leave his people\nalone. Everybody must leave his people alone. He is like a little child.\nHe will come to you straight.\" Alas! he knew Jim well--that \"mean little\nskunk,\" as Brown called him to me. \"Yes, certainly,\" he pursued with\nardour, \"and then, captain, you tell that tall man with a gun to shoot\nhim. Just you kill him, and you will frighten everybody so much that\nyou can do anything you like with them afterwards--get what you like--go\naway when you like. Ha! ha! ha! Fine . . .\" He almost danced with\nimpatience and eagerness; and Brown, looking over his shoulder at him,\ncould see, shown up by the pitiless dawn, his men drenched with dew,\nsitting amongst the cold ashes and the litter of the camp, haggard,\ncowed, and in rags.'\n\n\n'To the very last moment, till the full day came upon them with a\nspring, the fires on the west bank blazed bright and clear; and then\nBrown saw in a knot of coloured figures motionless between the advanced\nhouses a man in European clothes, in a helmet, all white. \"That's him;\nlook! look!\" Cornelius said excitedly. All Brown's men had sprung up and\ncrowded at his back with lustreless eyes. The group of vivid colours\nand dark faces with the white figure in their midst were observing the\nknoll. Brown could see naked arms being raised to shade the eyes and\nother brown arms pointing. What should he do? He looked around, and the\nforests that faced him on all sides walled the cock-pit of an unequal\ncontest. He looked once more at his men. A contempt, a weariness, the\ndesire of life, the wish to try for one more chance--for some other\ngrave--struggled in his breast. From the outline the figure presented\nit seemed to him that the white man there, backed up by all the power of\nthe land, was examining his position through binoculars. Brown jumped up\non the log, throwing his arms up, the palms outwards. The coloured group\nclosed round the white man, and fell back twice before he got clear of\nthem, walking slowly alone. Brown remained standing on the log till\nJim, appearing and disappearing between the patches of thorny scrub, had\nnearly reached the creek; then Brown jumped off and went down to meet\nhim on his side.\n\n'They met, I should think, not very far from the place, perhaps on the\nvery spot, where Jim took the second desperate leap of his life--the\nleap that landed him into the life of Patusan, into the trust, the love,\nthe confidence of the people. They faced each other across the creek,\nand with steady eyes tried to understand each other before they opened\ntheir lips. Their antagonism must have been expressed in their glances;\nI know that Brown hated Jim at first sight. Whatever hopes he might have\nhad vanished at once. This was not the man he had expected to see. He\nhated him for this--and in a checked flannel shirt with sleeves cut\noff at the elbows, grey bearded, with a sunken, sun-blackened face--he\ncursed in his heart the other's youth and assurance, his clear eyes and\nhis untroubled bearing. That fellow had got in a long way before him!\nHe did not look like a man who would be willing to give anything for\nassistance. He had all the advantages on his side--possession, security,\npower; he was on the side of an overwhelming force! He was not hungry\nand desperate, and he did not seem in the least afraid. And there was\nsomething in the very neatness of Jim's clothes, from the white helmet\nto the canvas leggings and the pipeclayed shoes, which in Brown's sombre\nirritated eyes seemed to belong to things he had in the very shaping of\nhis life condemned and flouted.\n\n'\"Who are you?\" asked Jim at last, speaking in his usual voice. \"My\nname's Brown,\" answered the other loudly; \"Captain Brown. What's yours?\"\nand Jim after a little pause went on quietly, as If he had not heard:\n\"What made you come here?\" \"You want to know,\" said Brown bitterly.\n\"It's easy to tell. Hunger. And what made you?\"\n\n'\"The fellow started at this,\" said Brown, relating to me the opening of\nthis strange conversation between those two men, separated only by\nthe muddy bed of a creek, but standing on the opposite poles of that\nconception of life which includes all mankind--\"The fellow started at\nthis and got very red in the face. Too big to be questioned, I suppose.\nI told him that if he looked upon me as a dead man with whom you may\ntake liberties, he himself was not a whit better off really. I had\na fellow up there who had a bead drawn on him all the time, and only\nwaited for a sign from me. There was nothing to be shocked at in this.\nHe had come down of his own free will. 'Let us agree,' said I, 'that we\nare both dead men, and let us talk on that basis, as equals. We are\nall equal before death,' I said. I admitted I was there like a rat in\na trap, but we had been driven to it, and even a trapped rat can give\na bite. He caught me up in a moment. 'Not if you don't go near the trap\ntill the rat is dead.' I told him that sort of game was good enough for\nthese native friends of his, but I would have thought him too white to\nserve even a rat so. Yes, I had wanted to talk with him. Not to beg\nfor my life, though. My fellows were--well--what they were--men like\nhimself, anyhow. All we wanted from him was to come on in the devil's\nname and have it out. 'God d--n it,' said I, while he stood there as\nstill as a wooden post, 'you don't want to come out here every day with\nyour glasses to count how many of us are left on our feet. Come. Either\nbring your infernal crowd along or let us go out and starve in the open\nsea, by God! You have been white once, for all your tall talk of this\nbeing your own people and you being one with them. Are you? And what the\ndevil do you get for it; what is it you've found here that is so d--d\nprecious? Hey? You don't want us to come down here perhaps--do you? You\nare two hundred to one. You don't want us to come down into the open.\nAh! I promise you we shall give you some sport before you've done. You\ntalk about me making a cowardly set upon unoffending people. What's\nthat to me that they are unoffending, when I am starving for next to no\noffence? But I am not a coward. Don't you be one. Bring them along or,\nby all the fiends, we shall yet manage to send half your unoffending\ntown to heaven with us in smoke!'\"\n\n'He was terrible--relating this to me--this tortured skeleton of a man\ndrawn up together with his face over his knees, upon a miserable bed in\nthat wretched hovel, and lifting his head to look at me with malignant\ntriumph.\n\n'\"That's what I told him--I knew what to say,\" he began again, feebly\nat first, but working himself up with incredible speed into a fiery\nutterance of his scorn. \"We aren't going into the forest to wander like\na string of living skeletons dropping one after another for ants to\ngo to work upon us before we are fairly dead. Oh no! . . . 'You don't\ndeserve a better fate,' he said. 'And what do you deserve,' I shouted\nat him, 'you that I find skulking here with your mouth full of your\nresponsibility, of innocent lives, of your infernal duty? What do\nyou know more of me than I know of you? I came here for food. D'ye\nhear?--food to fill our bellies. And what did _you_ come for? What did\nyou ask for when you came here? We don't ask you for anything but to\ngive us a fight or a clear road to go back whence we came. . . .' 'I\nwould fight with you now,' says he, pulling at his little moustache.\n'And I would let you shoot me, and welcome,' I said. 'This is as good a\njumping-off place for me as another. I am sick of my infernal luck. But\nit would be too easy. There are my men in the same boat--and, by God, I\nam not the sort to jump out of trouble and leave them in a d--d lurch,'\nI said. He stood thinking for a while and then wanted to know what I\nhad done ('out there' he says, tossing his head down-stream) to be hazed\nabout so. 'Have we met to tell each other the story of our lives?' I\nasked him. 'Suppose you begin. No? Well, I am sure I don't want to hear.\nKeep it to yourself. I know it is no better than mine. I've lived--and\nso did you, though you talk as if you were one of those people that\nshould have wings so as to go about without touching the dirty earth.\nWell--it is dirty. I haven't got any wings. I am here because I was\nafraid once in my life. Want to know what of? Of a prison. That scares\nme, and you may know it--if it's any good to you. I won't ask you what\nscared you into this infernal hole, where you seem to have found pretty\npickings. That's your luck and this is mine--the privilege to beg for\nthe favour of being shot quickly, or else kicked out to go free and\nstarve in my own way.' . . .\"\n\n'His debilitated body shook with an exultation so vehement, so assured,\nand so malicious that it seemed to have driven off the death waiting for\nhim in that hut. The corpse of his mad self-love uprose from rags and\ndestitution as from the dark horrors of a tomb. It is impossible to say\nhow much he lied to Jim then, how much he lied to me now--and to himself\nalways. Vanity plays lurid tricks with our memory, and the truth of\nevery passion wants some pretence to make it live. Standing at the gate\nof the other world in the guise of a beggar, he had slapped this world's\nface, he had spat on it, he had thrown upon it an immensity of scorn\nand revolt at the bottom of his misdeeds. He had overcome them all--men,\nwomen, savages, traders, ruffians, missionaries--and Jim--\"that\nbeefy-faced beggar.\" I did not begrudge him this triumph in articulo\nmortis, this almost posthumous illusion of having trampled all the earth\nunder his feet. While he was boasting to me, in his sordid and repulsive\nagony, I couldn't help thinking of the chuckling talk relating to the\ntime of his greatest splendour when, during a year or more, Gentleman\nBrown's ship was to be seen, for many days on end, hovering off an islet\nbefringed with green upon azure, with the dark dot of the mission-house\non a white beach; while Gentleman Brown, ashore, was casting his spells\nover a romantic girl for whom Melanesia had been too much, and giving\nhopes of a remarkable conversion to her husband. The poor man, some time\nor other, had been heard to express the intention of winning \"Captain\nBrown to a better way of life.\" . . . \"Bag Gentleman Brown for\nGlory\"--as a leery-eyed loafer expressed it once--\"just to let them see\nup above what a Western Pacific trading skipper looks like.\" And this\nwas the man, too, who had run off with a dying woman, and had shed tears\nover her body. \"Carried on like a big baby,\" his then mate was never\ntired of telling, \"and where the fun came in may I be kicked to death by\ndiseased Kanakas if _I_ know. Why, gents! she was too far gone when he\nbrought her aboard to know him; she just lay there on her back in his\nbunk staring at the beam with awful shining eyes--and then she died.\nDam' bad sort of fever, I guess. . . .\" I remembered all these stories\nwhile, wiping his matted lump of a beard with a livid hand, he was\ntelling me from his noisome couch how he got round, got in, got home,\non that confounded, immaculate, don't-you-touch-me sort of fellow. He\nadmitted that he couldn't be scared, but there was a way, \"as broad as\na turnpike, to get in and shake his twopenny soul around and inside out\nand upside down--by God!\"''I don't think he could do more than perhaps look upon that straight\npath. He seemed to have been puzzled by what he saw, for he interrupted\nhimself in his narrative more than once to exclaim, \"He nearly slipped\nfrom me there. I could not make him out. Who was he?\" And after\nglaring at me wildly he would go on, jubilating and sneering. To me the\nconversation of these two across the creek appears now as the deadliest\nkind of duel on which Fate looked on with her cold-eyed knowledge of the\nend. No, he didn't turn Jim's soul inside out, but I am much mistaken if\nthe spirit so utterly out of his reach had not been made to taste to the\nfull the bitterness of that contest. These were the emissaries with whom\nthe world he had renounced was pursuing him in his retreat--white men\nfrom \"out there\" where he did not think himself good enough to live.\nThis was all that came to him--a menace, a shock, a danger to his\nwork. I suppose it is this sad, half-resentful, half-resigned feeling,\npiercing through the few words Jim said now and then, that puzzled Brown\nso much in the reading of his character. Some great men owe most of\ntheir greatness to the ability of detecting in those they destine for\ntheir tools the exact quality of strength that matters for their work;\nand Brown, as though he had been really great, had a satanic gift of\nfinding out the best and the weakest spot in his victims. He admitted\nto me that Jim wasn't of the sort that can be got over by truckling, and\naccordingly he took care to show himself as a man confronting without\ndismay ill-luck, censure, and disaster. The smuggling of a few guns was\nno great crime, he pointed out. As to coming to Patusan, who had the\nright to say he hadn't come to beg? The infernal people here let loose\nat him from both banks without staying to ask questions. He made\nthe point brazenly, for, in truth, Dain Waris's energetic action had\nprevented the greatest calamities; because Brown told me distinctly\nthat, perceiving the size of the place, he had resolved instantly in his\nmind that as soon as he had gained a footing he would set fire right and\nleft, and begin by shooting down everything living in sight, in order to\ncow and terrify the population. The disproportion of forces was so great\nthat this was the only way giving him the slightest chance of attaining\nhis ends--he argued in a fit of coughing. But he didn't tell Jim this.\nAs to the hardships and starvation they had gone through, these had been\nvery real; it was enough to look at his band. He made, at the sound of a\nshrill whistle, all his men appear standing in a row on the logs in full\nview, so that Jim could see them. For the killing of the man, it had\nbeen done--well, it had--but was not this war, bloody war--in a corner?\nand the fellow had been killed cleanly, shot through the chest, not like\nthat poor devil of his lying now in the creek. They had to listen to him\ndying for six hours, with his entrails torn with slugs. At any rate this\nwas a life for a life. . . . And all this was said with the weariness,\nwith the recklessness of a man spurred on and on by ill-luck till he\ncares not where he runs. When he asked Jim, with a sort of brusque\ndespairing frankness, whether he himself--straight now--didn't\nunderstand that when \"it came to saving one's life in the dark, one\ndidn't care who else went--three, thirty, three hundred people\"--it was\nas if a demon had been whispering advice in his ear. \"I made him wince,\"\nboasted Brown to me. \"He very soon left off coming the righteous over\nme. He just stood there with nothing to say, and looking as black as\nthunder--not at me--on the ground.\" He asked Jim whether he had nothing\nfishy in his life to remember that he was so damnedly hard upon a man\ntrying to get out of a deadly hole by the first means that came to\nhand--and so on, and so on. And there ran through the rough talk a\nvein of subtle reference to their common blood, an assumption of common\nexperience; a sickening suggestion of common guilt, of secret knowledge\nthat was like a bond of their minds and of their hearts.\n\n'At last Brown threw himself down full length and watched Jim out of\nthe corners of his eyes. Jim on his side of the creek stood thinking and\nswitching his leg. The houses in view were silent, as if a pestilence\nhad swept them clean of every breath of life; but many invisible eyes\nwere turned, from within, upon the two men with the creek between them,\na stranded white boat, and the body of the third man half sunk in the\nmud. On the river canoes were moving again, for Patusan was recovering\nits belief in the stability of earthly institutions since the return of\nthe white lord. The right bank, the platforms of the houses, the rafts\nmoored along the shores, even the roofs of bathing-huts, were covered\nwith people that, far away out of earshot and almost out of sight, were\nstraining their eyes towards the knoll beyond the Rajah's stockade.\nWithin the wide irregular ring of forests, broken in two places by the\nsheen of the river, there was a silence. \"Will you promise to leave the\ncoast?\" Jim asked. Brown lifted and let fall his hand, giving everything\nup as it were--accepting the inevitable. \"And surrender your arms?\" Jim\nwent on. Brown sat up and glared across. \"Surrender our arms! Not till\nyou come to take them out of our stiff hands. You think I am gone crazy\nwith funk? Oh no! That and the rags I stand in is all I have got in the\nworld, besides a few more breechloaders on board; and I expect to sell\nthe lot in Madagascar, if I ever get so far--begging my way from ship to\nship.\"\n\n'Jim said nothing to this. At last, throwing away the switch he held in\nhis hand, he said, as if speaking to himself, \"I don't know whether I\nhave the power.\" . . . \"You don't know! And you wanted me just now to\ngive up my arms! That's good, too,\" cried Brown; \"Suppose they say one\nthing to you, and do the other thing to me.\" He calmed down markedly. \"I\ndare say you have the power, or what's the meaning of all this talk?\" he\ncontinued. \"What did you come down here for? To pass the time of day?\"\n\n'\"Very well,\" said Jim, lifting his head suddenly after a long silence.\n\"You shall have a clear road or else a clear fight.\" He turned on his\nheel and walked away.\n\n'Brown got up at once, but he did not go up the hill till he had seen\nJim disappear between the first houses. He never set his eyes on him\nagain. On his way back he met Cornelius slouching down with his head\nbetween his shoulders. He stopped before Brown. \"Why didn't you kill\nhim?\" he demanded in a sour, discontented voice. \"Because I could do\nbetter than that,\" Brown said with an amused smile. \"Never! never!\"\nprotested Cornelius with energy. \"Couldn't. I have lived here for many\nyears.\" Brown looked up at him curiously. There were many sides to the\nlife of that place in arms against him; things he would never find out.\nCornelius slunk past dejectedly in the direction of the river. He was\nnow leaving his new friends; he accepted the disappointing course of\nevents with a sulky obstinacy which seemed to draw more together his\nlittle yellow old face; and as he went down he glanced askant here and\nthere, never giving up his fixed idea.\n\n'Henceforth events move fast without a check, flowing from the very\nhearts of men like a stream from a dark source, and we see Jim amongst\nthem, mostly through Tamb' Itam's eyes. The girl's eyes had watched him\ntoo, but her life is too much entwined with his: there is her passion,\nher wonder, her anger, and, above all, her fear and her unforgiving\nlove. Of the faithful servant, uncomprehending as the rest of them, it\nis the fidelity alone that comes into play; a fidelity and a belief in\nhis lord so strong that even amazement is subdued to a sort of saddened\nacceptance of a mysterious failure. He has eyes only for one figure,\nand through all the mazes of bewilderment he preserves his air of\nguardianship, of obedience, of care.\n\n'His master came back from his talk with the white men, walking slowly\ntowards the stockade in the street. Everybody was rejoiced to see him\nreturn, for while he was away every man had been afraid not only of him\nbeing killed, but also of what would come after. Jim went into one of\nthe houses, where old Doramin had retired, and remained alone for a\nlong time with the head of the Bugis settlers. No doubt he discussed\nthe course to follow with him then, but no man was present at the\nconversation. Only Tamb' Itam, keeping as close to the door as he could,\nheard his master say, \"Yes. I shall let all the people know that such\nis my wish; but I spoke to you, O Doramin, before all the others, and\nalone; for you know my heart as well as I know yours and its greatest\ndesire. And you know well also that I have no thought but for the\npeople's good.\" Then his master, lifting the sheeting in the doorway,\nwent out, and he, Tamb' Itam, had a glimpse of old Doramin within,\nsitting in the chair with his hands on his knees, and looking between\nhis feet. Afterwards he followed his master to the fort, where all the\nprincipal Bugis and Patusan inhabitants had been summoned for a talk.\nTamb' Itam himself hoped there would be some fighting. \"What was it but\nthe taking of another hill?\" he exclaimed regretfully. However, in the\ntown many hoped that the rapacious strangers would be induced, by the\nsight of so many brave men making ready to fight, to go away. It would\nbe a good thing if they went away. Since Jim's arrival had been made\nknown before daylight by the gun fired from the fort and the beating of\nthe big drum there, the fear that had hung over Patusan had broken and\nsubsided like a wave on a rock, leaving the seething foam of excitement,\ncuriosity, and endless speculation. Half of the population had been\nousted out of their homes for purposes of defence, and were living in\nthe street on the left side of the river, crowding round the fort, and\nin momentary expectation of seeing their abandoned dwellings on the\nthreatened bank burst into flames. The general anxiety was to see the\nmatter settled quickly. Food, through Jewel's care, had been served\nout to the refugees. Nobody knew what their white man would do. Some\nremarked that it was worse than in Sherif Ali's war. Then many people\ndid not care; now everybody had something to lose. The movements of\ncanoes passing to and fro between the two parts of the town were watched\nwith interest. A couple of Bugis war-boats lay anchored in the middle of\nthe stream to protect the river, and a thread of smoke stood at the bow\nof each; the men in them were cooking their midday rice when Jim, after\nhis interviews with Brown and Doramin, crossed the river and entered by\nthe water-gate of his fort. The people inside crowded round him, so that\nhe could hardly make his way to the house. They had not seen him before,\nbecause on his arrival during the night he had only exchanged a few\nwords with the girl, who had come down to the landing-stage for the\npurpose, and had then gone on at once to join the chiefs and the\nfighting men on the other bank. People shouted greetings after him.\nOne old woman raised a laugh by pushing her way to the front madly and\nenjoining him in a scolding voice to see to it that her two sons, who\nwere with Doramin, did not come to harm at the hands of the robbers.\nSeveral of the bystanders tried to pull her away, but she struggled and\ncried, \"Let me go. What is this, O Muslims? This laughter is unseemly.\nAre they not cruel, bloodthirsty robbers bent on killing?\" \"Let her be,\"\nsaid Jim, and as a silence fell suddenly, he said slowly, \"Everybody\nshall be safe.\" He entered the house before the great sigh, and the loud\nmurmurs of satisfaction, had died out.\n\n'There's no doubt his mind was made up that Brown should have his way\nclear back to the sea. His fate, revolted, was forcing his hand. He\nhad for the first time to affirm his will in the face of outspoken\nopposition. \"There was much talk, and at first my master was silent,\"\nTamb' Itam said. \"Darkness came, and then I lit the candles on the long\ntable. The chiefs sat on each side, and the lady remained by my master's\nright hand.\"\n\n'When he began to speak, the unaccustomed difficulty seemed only to\nfix his resolve more immovably. The white men were now waiting for his\nanswer on the hill. Their chief had spoken to him in the language of his\nown people, making clear many things difficult to explain in any other\nspeech. They were erring men whom suffering had made blind to right and\nwrong. It is true that lives had been lost already, but why lose more?\nHe declared to his hearers, the assembled heads of the people, that\ntheir welfare was his welfare, their losses his losses, their mourning\nhis mourning. He looked round at the grave listening faces and told them\nto remember that they had fought and worked side by side. They knew his\ncourage . . . Here a murmur interrupted him . . . And that he had never\ndeceived them. For many years they had dwelt together. He loved the\nland and the people living in it with a very great love. He was ready to\nanswer with his life for any harm that should come to them if the white\nmen with beards were allowed to retire. They were evil-doers, but their\ndestiny had been evil, too. Had he ever advised them ill? Had his words\never brought suffering to the people? he asked. He believed that it\nwould be best to let these whites and their followers go with their\nlives. It would be a small gift. \"I whom you have tried and found always\ntrue ask you to let them go.\" He turned to Doramin. The old nakhoda made\nno movement. \"Then,\" said Jim, \"call in Dain Waris, your son, my friend,\nfor in this business I shall not lead.\"'\n'Tamb' Itam behind his chair was thunderstruck. The declaration produced\nan immense sensation. \"Let them go because this is best in my knowledge\nwhich has never deceived you,\" Jim insisted. There was a silence. In\nthe darkness of the courtyard could be heard the subdued whispering,\nshuffling noise of many people. Doramin raised his heavy head and said\nthat there was no more reading of hearts than touching the sky with the\nhand, but--he consented. The others gave their opinion in turn. \"It is\nbest,\" \"Let them go,\" and so on. But most of them simply said that they\n\"believed Tuan Jim.\"\n\n'In this simple form of assent to his will lies the whole gist of\nthe situation; their creed, his truth; and the testimony to that\nfaithfulness which made him in his own eyes the equal of the\nimpeccable men who never fall out of the ranks. Stein's words,\n\"Romantic!--Romantic!\" seem to ring over those distances that will never\ngive him up now to a world indifferent to his failings and his virtues,\nand to that ardent and clinging affection that refuses him the dole of\ntears in the bewilderment of a great grief and of eternal separation.\nFrom the moment the sheer truthfulness of his last three years of life\ncarries the day against the ignorance, the fear, and the anger of men,\nhe appears no longer to me as I saw him last--a white speck catching all\nthe dim light left upon a sombre coast and the darkened sea--but greater\nand more pitiful in the loneliness of his soul, that remains even for\nher who loved him best a cruel and insoluble mystery.\n\n'It is evident that he did not mistrust Brown; there was no reason to\ndoubt the story, whose truth seemed warranted by the rough frankness,\nby a sort of virile sincerity in accepting the morality and the\nconsequences of his acts. But Jim did not know the almost inconceivable\negotism of the man which made him, when resisted and foiled in his will,\nmad with the indignant and revengeful rage of a thwarted autocrat.\nBut if Jim did not mistrust Brown, he was evidently anxious that some\nmisunderstanding should not occur, ending perhaps in collision and\nbloodshed. It was for this reason that directly the Malay chiefs had\ngone he asked Jewel to get him something to eat, as he was going out of\nthe fort to take command in the town. On her remonstrating against this\non the score of his fatigue, he said that something might happen for\nwhich he would never forgive himself. \"I am responsible for every life\nin the land,\" he said. He was moody at first; she served him with her\nown hands, taking the plates and dishes (of the dinner-service presented\nhim by Stein) from Tamb' Itam. He brightened up after a while; told her\nshe would be again in command of the fort for another night. \"There's\nno sleep for us, old girl,\" he said, \"while our people are in danger.\"\nLater on he said jokingly that she was the best man of them all. \"If you\nand Dain Waris had done what you wanted, not one of these poor devils\nwould be alive to-day.\" \"Are they very bad?\" she asked, leaning over his\nchair. \"Men act badly sometimes without being much worse than others,\"\nhe said after some hesitation.\n\n'Tamb' Itam followed his master to the landing-stage outside the fort.\nThe night was clear but without a moon, and the middle of the river was\ndark, while the water under each bank reflected the light of many fires\n\"as on a night of Ramadan,\" Tamb' Itam said. War-boats drifted silently\nin the dark lane or, anchored, floated motionless with a loud ripple.\nThat night there was much paddling in a canoe and walking at his\nmaster's heels for Tamb' Itam: up and down the street they tramped,\nwhere the fires were burning, inland on the outskirts of the town where\nsmall parties of men kept guard in the fields. Tuan Jim gave his orders\nand was obeyed. Last of all they went to the Rajah's stockade, which a\ndetachment of Jim's people manned on that night. The old Rajah had fled\nearly in the morning with most of his women to a small house he had\nnear a jungle village on a tributary stream. Kassim, left behind, had\nattended the council with his air of diligent activity to explain away\nthe diplomacy of the day before. He was considerably cold-shouldered,\nbut managed to preserve his smiling, quiet alertness, and professed\nhimself highly delighted when Jim told him sternly that he proposed to\noccupy the stockade on that night with his own men. After the council\nbroke up he was heard outside accosting this and that deputing chief,\nand speaking in a loud, gratified tone of the Rajah's property being\nprotected in the Rajah's absence.\n\n'About ten or so Jim's men marched in. The stockade commanded the mouth\nof the creek, and Jim meant to remain there till Brown had passed below.\nA small fire was lit on the flat, grassy point outside the wall of\nstakes, and Tamb' Itam placed a little folding-stool for his master. Jim\ntold him to try and sleep. Tamb' Itam got a mat and lay down a little\nway off; but he could not sleep, though he knew he had to go on an\nimportant journey before the night was out. His master walked to and fro\nbefore the fire with bowed head and with his hands behind his back. His\nface was sad. Whenever his master approached him Tamb' Itam pretended to\nsleep, not wishing his master to know he had been watched. At last his\nmaster stood still, looking down on him as he lay, and said softly, \"It\nis time.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam arose directly and made his preparations. His mission was\nto go down the river, preceding Brown's boat by an hour or more, to tell\nDain Waris finally and formally that the whites were to be allowed to\npass out unmolested. Jim would not trust anybody else with that service.\nBefore starting, Tamb' Itam, more as a matter of form (since his\nposition about Jim made him perfectly known), asked for a token.\n\"Because, Tuan,\" he said, \"the message is important, and these are thy\nvery words I carry.\" His master first put his hand into one pocket, then\ninto another, and finally took off his forefinger Stein's silver ring,\nwhich he habitually wore, and gave it to Tamb' Itam. When Tamb' Itam\nleft on his mission, Brown's camp on the knoll was dark but for a single\nsmall glow shining through the branches of one of the trees the white\nmen had cut down.\n\n'Early in the evening Brown had received from Jim a folded piece of\npaper on which was written, \"You get the clear road. Start as soon\nas your boat floats on the morning tide. Let your men be careful. The\nbushes on both sides of the creek and the stockade at the mouth are full\nof well-armed men. You would have no chance, but I don't believe you\nwant bloodshed.\" Brown read it, tore the paper into small pieces, and,\nturning to Cornelius, who had brought it, said jeeringly, \"Good-bye, my\nexcellent friend.\" Cornelius had been in the fort, and had been sneaking\naround Jim's house during the afternoon. Jim chose him to carry the note\nbecause he could speak English, was known to Brown, and was not likely\nto be shot by some nervous mistake of one of the men as a Malay,\napproaching in the dusk, perhaps might have been.\n\n'Cornelius didn't go away after delivering the paper. Brown was sitting\nup over a tiny fire; all the others were lying down. \"I could tell you\nsomething you would like to know,\" Cornelius mumbled crossly. Brown paid\nno attention. \"You did not kill him,\" went on the other, \"and what do\nyou get for it? You might have had money from the Rajah, besides the\nloot of all the Bugis houses, and now you get nothing.\" \"You had better\nclear out from here,\" growled Brown, without even looking at him. But\nCornelius let himself drop by his side and began to whisper very fast,\ntouching his elbow from time to time. What he had to say made Brown sit\nup at first, with a curse. He had simply informed him of Dain Waris's\narmed party down the river. At first Brown saw himself completely sold\nand betrayed, but a moment's reflection convinced him that there could\nbe no treachery intended. He said nothing, and after a while Cornelius\nremarked, in a tone of complete indifference, that there was another way\nout of the river which he knew very well. \"A good thing to know, too,\"\nsaid Brown, pricking up his ears; and Cornelius began to talk of\nwhat went on in town and repeated all that had been said in council,\ngossiping in an even undertone at Brown's ear as you talk amongst\nsleeping men you do not wish to wake. \"He thinks he has made me\nharmless, does he?\" mumbled Brown very low. . . . \"Yes. He is a fool. A\nlittle child. He came here and robbed me,\" droned on Cornelius, \"and he\nmade all the people believe him. But if something happened that they did\nnot believe him any more, where would he be? And the Bugis Dain who\nis waiting for you down the river there, captain, is the very man who\nchased you up here when you first came.\" Brown observed nonchalantly\nthat it would be just as well to avoid him, and with the same detached,\nmusing air Cornelius declared himself acquainted with a backwater broad\nenough to take Brown's boat past Waris's camp. \"You will have to be\nquiet,\" he said as an afterthought, \"for in one place we pass close\nbehind his camp. Very close. They are camped ashore with their boats\nhauled up.\" \"Oh, we know how to be as quiet as mice; never fear,\" said\nBrown. Cornelius stipulated that in case he were to pilot Brown out, his\ncanoe should be towed. \"I'll have to get back quick,\" he explained.\n\n'It was two hours before the dawn when word was passed to the stockade\nfrom outlying watchers that the white robbers were coming down to their\nboat. In a very short time every armed man from one end of Patusan\nto the other was on the alert, yet the banks of the river remained so\nsilent that but for the fires burning with sudden blurred flares the\ntown might have been asleep as if in peace-time. A heavy mist lay very\nlow on the water, making a sort of illusive grey light that showed\nnothing. When Brown's long-boat glided out of the creek into the\nriver, Jim was standing on the low point of land before the Rajah's\nstockade--on the very spot where for the first time he put his foot on\nPatusan shore. A shadow loomed up, moving in the greyness, solitary,\nvery bulky, and yet constantly eluding the eye. A murmur of low talking\ncame out of it. Brown at the tiller heard Jim speak calmly: \"A clear\nroad. You had better trust to the current while the fog lasts; but\nthis will lift presently.\" \"Yes, presently we shall see clear,\" replied\nBrown.\n\n'The thirty or forty men standing with muskets at ready outside the\nstockade held their breath. The Bugis owner of the prau, whom I saw\non Stein's verandah, and who was amongst them, told me that the boat,\nshaving the low point close, seemed for a moment to grow big and hang\nover it like a mountain. \"If you think it worth your while to wait a\nday outside,\" called out Jim, \"I'll try to send you down something--a\nbullock, some yams--what I can.\" The shadow went on moving. \"Yes. Do,\"\nsaid a voice, blank and muffled out of the fog. Not one of the many\nattentive listeners understood what the words meant; and then Brown\nand his men in their boat floated away, fading spectrally without the\nslightest sound.\n\n'Thus Brown, invisible in the mist, goes out of Patusan elbow to elbow\nwith Cornelius in the stern-sheets of the long-boat. \"Perhaps you shall\nget a small bullock,\" said Cornelius. \"Oh yes. Bullock. Yam. You'll get\nit if he said so. He always speaks the truth. He stole everything I had.\nI suppose you like a small bullock better than the loot of many houses.\"\n\"I would advise you to hold your tongue, or somebody here may fling\nyou overboard into this damned fog,\" said Brown. The boat seemed to be\nstanding still; nothing could be seen, not even the river alongside,\nonly the water-dust flew and trickled, condensed, down their beards and\nfaces. It was weird, Brown told me. Every individual man of them felt\nas though he were adrift alone in a boat, haunted by an almost\nimperceptible suspicion of sighing, muttering ghosts. \"Throw me out,\nwould you? But I would know where I was,\" mumbled Cornelius surlily.\n\"I've lived many years here.\" \"Not long enough to see through a fog like\nthis,\" Brown said, lolling back with his arm swinging to and fro on the\nuseless tiller. \"Yes. Long enough for that,\" snarled Cornelius. \"That's\nvery useful,\" commented Brown. \"Am I to believe you could find that\nbackway you spoke of blindfold, like this?\" Cornelius grunted. \"Are you\ntoo tired to row?\" he asked after a silence. \"No, by God!\" shouted Brown\nsuddenly. \"Out with your oars there.\" There was a great knocking in\nthe fog, which after a while settled into a regular grind of invisible\nsweeps against invisible thole-pins. Otherwise nothing was changed, and\nbut for the slight splash of a dipped blade it was like rowing a balloon\ncar in a cloud, said Brown. Thereafter Cornelius did not open his lips\nexcept to ask querulously for somebody to bale out his canoe, which\nwas towing behind the long-boat. Gradually the fog whitened and became\nluminous ahead. To the left Brown saw a darkness as though he had been\nlooking at the back of the departing night. All at once a big bough\ncovered with leaves appeared above his head, and ends of twigs, dripping\nand still, curved slenderly close alongside. Cornelius, without a word,\ntook the tiller from his hand.'\n\n'I don't think they spoke together again. The boat entered a narrow\nby-channel, where it was pushed by the oar-blades set into crumbling\nbanks, and there was a gloom as if enormous black wings had been\noutspread above the mist that filled its depth to the summits of the\ntrees. The branches overhead showered big drops through the gloomy fog.\nAt a mutter from Cornelius, Brown ordered his men to load. \"I'll\ngive you a chance to get even with them before we're done, you dismal\ncripples, you,\" he said to his gang. \"Mind you don't throw it away--you\nhounds.\" Low growls answered that speech. Cornelius showed much fussy\nconcern for the safety of his canoe.\n\n'Meantime Tamb' Itam had reached the end of his journey. The fog had\ndelayed him a little, but he had paddled steadily, keeping in touch with\nthe south bank. By-and-by daylight came like a glow in a ground glass\nglobe. The shores made on each side of the river a dark smudge, in which\none could detect hints of columnar forms and shadows of twisted branches\nhigh up. The mist was still thick on the water, but a good watch was\nbeing kept, for as Iamb' Itam approached the camp the figures of two men\nemerged out of the white vapour, and voices spoke to him boisterously.\nHe answered, and presently a canoe lay alongside, and he exchanged news\nwith the paddlers. All was well. The trouble was over. Then the men in\nthe canoe let go their grip on the side of his dug-out and incontinently\nfell out of sight. He pursued his way till he heard voices coming to him\nquietly over the water, and saw, under the now lifting, swirling mist,\nthe glow of many little fires burning on a sandy stretch, backed by\nlofty thin timber and bushes. There again a look-out was kept, for he\nwas challenged. He shouted his name as the two last sweeps of his paddle\nran his canoe up on the strand. It was a big camp. Men crouched in many\nlittle knots under a subdued murmur of early morning talk. Many thin\nthreads of smoke curled slowly on the white mist. Little shelters,\nelevated above the ground, had been built for the chiefs. Muskets were\nstacked in small pyramids, and long spears were stuck singly into the\nsand near the fires.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, assuming an air of importance, demanded to be led to Dain\nWaris. He found the friend of his white lord lying on a raised couch\nmade of bamboo, and sheltered by a sort of shed of sticks covered with\nmats. Dain Waris was awake, and a bright fire was burning before his\nsleeping-place, which resembled a rude shrine. The only son of nakhoda\nDoramin answered his greeting kindly. Tamb' Itam began by handing him\nthe ring which vouched for the truth of the messenger's words. Dain\nWaris, reclining on his elbow, bade him speak and tell all the news.\nBeginning with the consecrated formula, \"The news is good,\" Tamb' Itam\ndelivered Jim's own words. The white men, deputing with the consent of\nall the chiefs, were to be allowed to pass down the river. In answer to\na question or two Tamb' Itam then reported the proceedings of the last\ncouncil. Dain Waris listened attentively to the end, toying with the\nring which ultimately he slipped on the forefinger of his right hand.\nAfter hearing all he had to say he dismissed Tamb' Itam to have food\nand rest. Orders for the return in the afternoon were given immediately.\nAfterwards Dain Waris lay down again, open-eyed, while his personal\nattendants were preparing his food at the fire, by which Tamb' Itam also\nsat talking to the men who lounged up to hear the latest intelligence\nfrom the town. The sun was eating up the mist. A good watch was kept\nupon the reach of the main stream where the boat of the whites was\nexpected to appear every moment.\n\n'It was then that Brown took his revenge upon the world which, after\ntwenty years of contemptuous and reckless bullying, refused him the\ntribute of a common robber's success. It was an act of cold-blooded\nferocity, and it consoled him on his deathbed like a memory of an\nindomitable defiance. Stealthily he landed his men on the other side\nof the island opposite to the Bugis camp, and led them across. After a\nshort but quite silent scuffle, Cornelius, who had tried to slink away\nat the moment of landing, resigned himself to show the way where the\nundergrowth was most sparse. Brown held both his skinny hands together\nbehind his back in the grip of one vast fist, and now and then impelled\nhim forward with a fierce push. Cornelius remained as mute as a fish,\nabject but faithful to his purpose, whose accomplishment loomed before\nhim dimly. At the edge of the patch of forest Brown's men spread\nthemselves out in cover and waited. The camp was plain from end to end\nbefore their eyes, and no one looked their way. Nobody even dreamed that\nthe white men could have any knowledge of the narrow channel at the back\nof the island. When he judged the moment come, Brown yelled, \"Let them\nhave it,\" and fourteen shots rang out like one.\n\n'Tamb' Itam told me the surprise was so great that, except for those who\nfell dead or wounded, not a soul of them moved for quite an appreciable\ntime after the first discharge. Then a man screamed, and after that\nscream a great yell of amazement and fear went up from all the throats.\nA blind panic drove these men in a surging swaying mob to and fro along\nthe shore like a herd of cattle afraid of the water. Some few jumped\ninto the river then, but most of them did so only after the last\ndischarge. Three times Brown's men fired into the ruck, Brown, the only\none in view, cursing and yelling, \"Aim low! aim low!\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam says that, as for him, he understood at the first volley\nwhat had happened. Though untouched he fell down and lay as if dead,\nbut with his eyes open. At the sound of the first shots Dain Waris,\nreclining on the couch, jumped up and ran out upon the open shore, just\nin time to receive a bullet in his forehead at the second discharge.\nTamb' Itam saw him fling his arms wide open before he fell. Then, he\nsays, a great fear came upon him--not before. The white men retired as\nthey had come--unseen.\n\n'Thus Brown balanced his account with the evil fortune. Notice that even\nin this awful outbreak there is a superiority as of a man who carries\nright--the abstract thing--within the envelope of his common desires.\nIt was not a vulgar and treacherous massacre; it was a lesson, a\nretribution--a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our\nnature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we\nlike to think.\n\n'Afterwards the whites depart unseen by Tamb' Itam, and seem to vanish\nfrom before men's eyes altogether; and the schooner, too, vanishes after\nthe manner of stolen goods. But a story is told of a white long-boat\npicked up a month later in the Indian Ocean by a cargo steamer. Two\nparched, yellow, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons in her recognised\nthe authority of a third, who declared that his name was Brown. His\nschooner, he reported, bound south with a cargo of Java sugar, had\nsprung a bad leak and sank under his feet. He and his companions were\nthe survivors of a crew of six. The two died on board the steamer which\nrescued them. Brown lived to be seen by me, and I can testify that he\nhad played his part to the last.\n\n'It seems, however, that in going away they had neglected to cast off\nCornelius's canoe. Cornelius himself Brown had let go at the beginning\nof the shooting, with a kick for a parting benediction. Tamb' Itam,\nafter arising from amongst the dead, saw the Nazarene running up and\ndown the shore amongst the corpses and the expiring fires. He uttered\nlittle cries. Suddenly he rushed to the water, and made frantic efforts\nto get one of the Bugis boats into the water. \"Afterwards, till he had\nseen me,\" related Tamb' Itam, \"he stood looking at the heavy canoe and\nscratching his head.\" \"What became of him?\" I asked. Tamb' Itam, staring\nhard at me, made an expressive gesture with his right arm. \"Twice I\nstruck, Tuan,\" he said. \"When he beheld me approaching he cast himself\nviolently on the ground and made a great outcry, kicking. He screeched\nlike a frightened hen till he felt the point; then he was still, and lay\nstaring at me while his life went out of his eyes.\"\n\n'This done, Tamb' Itam did not tarry. He understood the importance of\nbeing the first with the awful news at the fort. There were, of course,\nmany survivors of Dain Waris's party; but in the extremity of panic some\nhad swum across the river, others had bolted into the bush. The fact is\nthat they did not know really who struck that blow--whether more white\nrobbers were not coming, whether they had not already got hold of\nthe whole land. They imagined themselves to be the victims of a vast\ntreachery, and utterly doomed to destruction. It is said that some small\nparties did not come in till three days afterwards. However, a few tried\nto make their way back to Patusan at once, and one of the canoes that\nwere patrolling the river that morning was in sight of the camp at\nthe very moment of the attack. It is true that at first the men in her\nleaped overboard and swam to the opposite bank, but afterwards they\nreturned to their boat and started fearfully up-stream. Of these Tamb'\nItam had an hour's advance.''When Tamb' Itam, paddling madly, came into the town-reach, the women,\nthronging the platforms before the houses, were looking out for the\nreturn of Dain Waris's little fleet of boats. The town had a festive\nair; here and there men, still with spears or guns in their hands, could\nbe seen moving or standing on the shore in groups. Chinamen's shops had\nbeen opened early; but the market-place was empty, and a sentry, still\nposted at the corner of the fort, made out Tamb' Itam, and shouted to\nthose within. The gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam jumped ashore and ran\nin headlong. The first person he met was the girl coming down from the\nhouse.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, disordered, panting, with trembling lips and wild eyes,\nstood for a time before her as if a sudden spell had been laid on him.\nThen he broke out very quickly: \"They have killed Dain Waris and many\nmore.\" She clapped her hands, and her first words were, \"Shut the\ngates.\" Most of the fortmen had gone back to their houses, but Tamb'\nItam hurried on the few who remained for their turn of duty within. The\ngirl stood in the middle of the courtyard while the others ran about.\n\"Doramin,\" she cried despairingly, as Tamb' Itam passed her. Next time\nhe went by he answered her thought rapidly, \"Yes. But we have all the\npowder in Patusan.\" She caught him by the arm, and, pointing at the\nhouse, \"Call him out,\" she whispered, trembling.\n\n'Tamb' Itam ran up the steps. His master was sleeping. \"It is I, Tamb'\nItam,\" he cried at the door, \"with tidings that cannot wait.\" He saw\nJim turn over on the pillow and open his eyes, and he burst out at\nonce. \"This, Tuan, is a day of evil, an accursed day.\" His master raised\nhimself on his elbow to listen--just as Dain Waris had done. And then\nTamb' Itam began his tale, trying to relate the story in order, calling\nDain Waris Panglima, and saying: \"The Panglima then called out to the\nchief of his own boatmen, 'Give Tamb' Itam something to eat'\"--when\nhis master put his feet to the ground and looked at him with such a\ndiscomposed face that the words remained in his throat.\n\n'\"Speak out,\" said Jim. \"Is he dead?\" \"May you live long,\" cried Tamb'\nItam. \"It was a most cruel treachery. He ran out at the first shots and\nfell.\" . . . His master walked to the window and with his fist struck\nat the shutter. The room was made light; and then in a steady voice, but\nspeaking fast, he began to give him orders to assemble a fleet of boats\nfor immediate pursuit, go to this man, to the other--send messengers;\nand as he talked he sat down on the bed, stooping to lace his boots\nhurriedly, and suddenly looked up. \"Why do you stand here?\" he asked\nvery red-faced. \"Waste no time.\" Tamb' Itam did not move. \"Forgive me,\nTuan, but . . . but,\" he began to stammer. \"What?\" cried his master\naloud, looking terrible, leaning forward with his hands gripping the\nedge of the bed. \"It is not safe for thy servant to go out amongst the\npeople,\" said Tamb' Itam, after hesitating a moment.\n\n'Then Jim understood. He had retreated from one world, for a small\nmatter of an impulsive jump, and now the other, the work of his own\nhands, had fallen in ruins upon his head. It was not safe for his\nservant to go out amongst his own people! I believe that in that very\nmoment he had decided to defy the disaster in the only way it occurred\nto him such a disaster could be defied; but all I know is that, without\na word, he came out of his room and sat before the long table, at the\nhead of which he was accustomed to regulate the affairs of his world,\nproclaiming daily the truth that surely lived in his heart. The dark\npowers should not rob him twice of his peace. He sat like a stone\nfigure. Tamb' Itam, deferential, hinted at preparations for defence.\nThe girl he loved came in and spoke to him, but he made a sign with his\nhand, and she was awed by the dumb appeal for silence in it. She went\nout on the verandah and sat on the threshold, as if to guard him with\nher body from dangers outside.\n\n'What thoughts passed through his head--what memories? Who can tell?\nEverything was gone, and he who had been once unfaithful to his trust\nhad lost again all men's confidence. It was then, I believe, he tried\nto write--to somebody--and gave it up. Loneliness was closing on him.\nPeople had trusted him with their lives--only for that; and yet they\ncould never, as he had said, never be made to understand him. Those\nwithout did not hear him make a sound. Later, towards the evening, he\ncame to the door and called for Tamb' Itam. \"Well?\" he asked. \"There is\nmuch weeping. Much anger too,\" said Tamb' Itam. Jim looked up at him.\n\"You know,\" he murmured. \"Yes, Tuan,\" said Tamb' Itam. \"Thy servant does\nknow, and the gates are closed. We shall have to fight.\" \"Fight! What\nfor?\" he asked. \"For our lives.\" \"I have no life,\" he said. Tamb' Itam\nheard a cry from the girl at the door. \"Who knows?\" said Tamb' Itam.\n\"By audacity and cunning we may even escape. There is much fear in men's\nhearts too.\" He went out, thinking vaguely of boats and of open sea,\nleaving Jim and the girl together.\n\n'I haven't the heart to set down here such glimpses as she had given\nme of the hour or more she passed in there wrestling with him for the\npossession of her happiness. Whether he had any hope--what he expected,\nwhat he imagined--it is impossible to say. He was inflexible, and with\nthe growing loneliness of his obstinacy his spirit seemed to rise above\nthe ruins of his existence. She cried \"Fight!\" into his ear. She could\nnot understand. There was nothing to fight for. He was going to prove\nhis power in another way and conquer the fatal destiny itself. He came\nout into the courtyard, and behind him, with streaming hair, wild\nof face, breathless, she staggered out and leaned on the side of the\ndoorway. \"Open the gates,\" he ordered. Afterwards, turning to those of\nhis men who were inside, he gave them leave to depart to their homes.\n\"For how long, Tuan?\" asked one of them timidly. \"For all life,\" he\nsaid, in a sombre tone.\n\n'A hush had fallen upon the town after the outburst of wailing and\nlamentation that had swept over the river, like a gust of wind from the\nopened abode of sorrow. But rumours flew in whispers, filling the hearts\nwith consternation and horrible doubts. The robbers were coming back,\nbringing many others with them, in a great ship, and there would be no\nrefuge in the land for any one. A sense of utter insecurity as during\nan earthquake pervaded the minds of men, who whispered their suspicions,\nlooking at each other as if in the presence of some awful portent.\n\n'The sun was sinking towards the forests when Dain Waris's body was\nbrought into Doramin's campong. Four men carried it in, covered decently\nwith a white sheet which the old mother had sent out down to the gate to\nmeet her son on his return. They laid him at Doramin's feet, and the old\nman sat still for a long time, one hand on each knee, looking down. The\nfronds of palms swayed gently, and the foliage of fruit trees stirred\nabove his head. Every single man of his people was there, fully armed,\nwhen the old nakhoda at last raised his eyes. He moved them slowly over\nthe crowd, as if seeking for a missing face. Again his chin sank on his\nbreast. The whispers of many men mingled with the slight rustling of the\nleaves.\n\n'The Malay who had brought Tamb' Itam and the girl to Samarang was there\ntoo. \"Not so angry as many,\" he said to me, but struck with a great\nawe and wonder at the \"suddenness of men's fate, which hangs over their\nheads like a cloud charged with thunder.\" He told me that when Dain\nWaris's body was uncovered at a sign of Doramin's, he whom they often\ncalled the white lord's friend was disclosed lying unchanged with his\neyelids a little open as if about to wake. Doramin leaned forward a\nlittle more, like one looking for something fallen on the ground. His\neyes searched the body from its feet to its head, for the wound maybe.\nIt was in the forehead and small; and there was no word spoken while\none of the by-standers, stooping, took off the silver ring from the cold\nstiff hand. In silence he held it up before Doramin. A murmur of dismay\nand horror ran through the crowd at the sight of that familiar token.\nThe old nakhoda stared at it, and suddenly let out one great fierce cry,\ndeep from the chest, a roar of pain and fury, as mighty as the bellow of\na wounded bull, bringing great fear into men's hearts, by the magnitude\nof his anger and his sorrow that could be plainly discerned without\nwords. There was a great stillness afterwards for a space, while the\nbody was being borne aside by four men. They laid it down under a tree,\nand on the instant, with one long shriek, all the women of the household\nbegan to wail together; they mourned with shrill cries; the sun\nwas setting, and in the intervals of screamed lamentations the high\nsing-song voices of two old men intoning the Koran chanted alone.\n\n'About this time Jim, leaning on a gun-carriage, looked at the river,\nand turned his back on the house; and the girl, in the doorway, panting\nas if she had run herself to a standstill, was looking at him across the\nyard. Tamb' Itam stood not far from his master, waiting patiently for\nwhat might happen. All at once Jim, who seemed to be lost in quiet\nthought, turned to him and said, \"Time to finish this.\"\n\n'\"Tuan?\" said Tamb' Itam, advancing with alacrity. He did not know what\nhis master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started\ntoo and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of\nthe people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about\nhalf-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful\ncontemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against\nthe gun. \"Will you fight?\" she cried. \"There is nothing to fight for,\"\nhe said; \"nothing is lost.\" Saying this he made a step towards her.\n\"Will you fly?\" she cried again. \"There is no escape,\" he said, stopping\nshort, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes.\n\"And you shall go?\" she said slowly. He bent his head. \"Ah!\" she\nexclaimed, peering at him as it were, \"you are mad or false. Do you\nremember the night I prayed you to leave me, and you said that you could\nnot? That it was impossible! Impossible! Do you remember you said you\nwould never leave me? Why? I asked you for no promise. You promised\nunasked--remember.\" \"Enough, poor girl,\" he said. \"I should not be worth\nhaving.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam said that while they were talking she would laugh loud and\nsenselessly like one under the visitation of God. His master put his\nhands to his head. He was fully dressed as for every day, but without\na hat. She stopped laughing suddenly. \"For the last time,\" she cried\nmenacingly, \"will you defend yourself?\" \"Nothing can touch me,\" he said\nin a last flicker of superb egoism. Tamb' Itam saw her lean forward\nwhere she stood, open her arms, and run at him swiftly. She flung\nherself upon his breast and clasped him round the neck.\n\n'\"Ah! but I shall hold thee thus,\" she cried. . . . \"Thou art mine!\"\n\n'She sobbed on his shoulder. The sky over Patusan was blood-red,\nimmense, streaming like an open vein. An enormous sun nestled crimson\namongst the tree-tops, and the forest below had a black and forbidding\nface.\n\n'Tamb' Itam tells me that on that evening the aspect of the heavens was\nangry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know that on that very\nday a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was\nhardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.\n\n'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim catch her arms, trying to unclasp her\nhands. She hung on them with her head fallen back; her hair touched the\nground. \"Come here!\" his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped to ease\nher down. It was difficult to separate her fingers. Jim, bending\nover her, looked earnestly upon her face, and all at once ran to the\nlanding-stage. Tamb' Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw\nthat she had struggled up to her feet. She ran after them a few steps,\nthen fell down heavily on her knees. \"Tuan! Tuan!\" called Tamb' Itam,\n\"look back;\" but Jim was already in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand.\nHe did not look back. Tamb' Itam had just time to scramble in after\nhim when the canoe floated clear. The girl was then on her knees, with\nclasped hands, at the water-gate. She remained thus for a time in\na supplicating attitude before she sprang up. \"You are false!\" she\nscreamed out after Jim. \"Forgive me,\" he cried. \"Never! Never!\" she\ncalled back.\n\n'Tamb' Itam took the paddle from Jim's hands, it being unseemly that he\nshould sit while his lord paddled. When they reached the other shore his\nmaster forbade him to come any farther; but Tamb' Itam did follow him at\na distance, walking up the slope to Doramin's campong.\n\n'It was beginning to grow dark. Torches twinkled here and there. Those\nthey met seemed awestruck, and stood aside hastily to let Jim pass. The\nwailing of women came from above. The courtyard was full of armed Bugis\nwith their followers, and of Patusan people.\n\n'I do not know what this gathering really meant. Were these preparations\nfor war, or for vengeance, or to repulse a threatened invasion? Many\ndays elapsed before the people had ceased to look out, quaking, for\nthe return of the white men with long beards and in rags, whose exact\nrelation to their own white man they could never understand. Even for\nthose simple minds poor Jim remains under a cloud.\n\n'Doramin, alone! immense and desolate, sat in his arm-chair with the\npair of flintlock pistols on his knees, faced by a armed throng. When\nJim appeared, at somebody's exclamation, all the heads turned round\ntogether, and then the mass opened right and left, and he walked up a\nlane of averted glances. Whispers followed him; murmurs: \"He has worked\nall the evil.\" \"He hath a charm.\" . . . He heard them--perhaps!\n\n'When he came up into the light of torches the wailing of the women\nceased suddenly. Doramin did not lift his head, and Jim stood silent\nbefore him for a time. Then he looked to the left, and moved in that\ndirection with measured steps. Dain Waris's mother crouched at the head\nof the body, and the grey dishevelled hair concealed her face. Jim came\nup slowly, looked at his dead friend, lifting the sheet, than dropped it\nwithout a word. Slowly he walked back.\n\n'\"He came! He came!\" was running from lip to lip, making a murmur to\nwhich he moved. \"He hath taken it upon his own head,\" a voice said\naloud. He heard this and turned to the crowd. \"Yes. Upon my head.\" A few\npeople recoiled. Jim waited awhile before Doramin, and then said gently,\n\"I am come in sorrow.\" He waited again. \"I am come ready and unarmed,\"\nhe repeated.\n\n'The unwieldy old man, lowering his big forehead like an ox under a\nyoke, made an effort to rise, clutching at the flintlock pistols on his\nknees. From his throat came gurgling, choking, inhuman sounds, and his\ntwo attendants helped him from behind. People remarked that the ring\nwhich he had dropped on his lap fell and rolled against the foot of\nthe white man, and that poor Jim glanced down at the talisman that had\nopened for him the door of fame, love, and success within the wall of\nforests fringed with white foam, within the coast that under the western\nsun looks like the very stronghold of the night. Doramin, struggling to\nkeep his feet, made with his two supporters a swaying, tottering group;\nhis little eyes stared with an expression of mad pain, of rage, with\na ferocious glitter, which the bystanders noticed; and then, while Jim\nstood stiffened and with bared head in the light of torches, looking him\nstraight in the face, he clung heavily with his left arm round the neck\nof a bowed youth, and lifting deliberately his right, shot his son's\nfriend through the chest.\n\n'The crowd, which had fallen apart behind Jim as soon as Doramin had\nraised his hand, rushed tumultuously forward after the shot. They say\nthat the white man sent right and left at all those faces a proud and\nunflinching glance. Then with his hand over his lips he fell forward,\ndead.\n\n'And that's the end. He passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart,\nforgotten, unforgiven, and excessively romantic. Not in the wildest days\nof his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring shape of such an\nextraordinary success! For it may very well be that in the short moment\nof his last proud and unflinching glance, he had beheld the face of that\nopportunity which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side.\n\n'But we can see him, an obscure conqueror of fame, tearing himself out\nof the arms of a jealous love at the sign, at the call of his exalted\negoism. He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless\nwedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct. Is he satisfied--quite, now, I\nwonder? We ought to know. He is one of us--and have I not stood up once,\nlike an evoked ghost, to answer for his eternal constancy? Was I so very\nwrong after all? Now he is no more, there are days when the reality of\nhis existence comes to me with an immense, with an overwhelming force;\nand yet upon my honour there are moments, too when he passes from my\neyes like a disembodied spirit astray amongst the passions of this\nearth, ready to surrender himself faithfully to the claim of his own\nworld of shades.\n\n'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and the poor girl is\nleading a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has\naged greatly of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is\n\"preparing to leave all this; preparing to leave . . .\" while he waves\nhis hand sadly at his butterflies.'","chapter_length":13753.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 40-45","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210422054542\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/lord-jim\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-40-45","summary_text":"As Brown tells his story to Marlow, Marlow writes that he is struck by his impression of \"an undisguised ruthlessness of purpose, a strange vengeful attitude towards his own past, and a blind belief in the righteousness of his will against all mankind\" . In the battle, Brown was almost paralyzed by fear. The numbers were 200 to one. Fear among the people, however, had also begun to unravel the social fabric. One of Brown's men is shot down, so Brown shoots one of the Bugis three times in the stomach. Then, sounds of joy lift in the air. Cornelius tells Brown that Jim has returned, not afraid of anything. When Brown sees Jim, he sees a man in European clothes, all in white, with a helmet. The two meet near the very spot where Jim had taken \"the second desperate leap of his life--the leap that landed him into the life of Patusan, into the trust, the love, the confidence of the people\" . Brown hates Jim on sight--for his youth and his assurance, his self-possession, his power and neatness. They converse, and Brown yells to him that it was hunger that had driven him to Patusan. Why had Jim come? The conversation strikes Marlow as a duel, and as if Brown, like a great man, had discovered Jim's weakest spot. He says, \"if it came to saving one's life in the dark, one didn't care who else went--three, thirty, three hundred people\" . Jim says nothing in response, and he is struck by \"their common blood, an assumption of common experience; a sickening suggestion of common guilt, of secret knowledge that was like a bond of their minds and of their hearts\" .

Jim includes Stein's silver ring as a sign of good faith and, at the same time, he sends Brown a note with Cornelius as messenger. The note says, \"You get the clear road\" . But, upon delivering the note, Cornelius remains with Brown and tells him that Dain Waris's party is downriver and lying in wait to lay ambush on him as they pass. Brown feels betrayed yet, strangely enough, he doesn't seem to believe it. To be safe, he takes the creek he had noticed upon his first arrival. Through the fog, he takes Cornelius with him in the longboat. After Tamb' Itam approaches Dain Waris's camp and delivers the message with the ring, saying that all is well and that the trouble has passed, Dain Waris slips the ring onto the forefinger of his right hand. Brown's men land nearby and, though Cornelius tries to get away, force him to lead the way to the camp. No one had imagined that the white men would know of the creek. Fourteen shots ring out, and Dain Waris jumps up, running to the open shore. There, Tamb' Itam sees a bullet hit Darin Waris's forehead, and a great fear falls upon him. The white men disappear. Tamb' Itam sees Cornelius and shoots him twice, watching him die. He then hurries back to the town, knowing that it is important that he be the first bearer of the news. When he arrives, the town is festive. He seeks out the girl and reports what has happened. They go to find Jim, and he tells Jim that it is not safe for him to go out amongst the people.

He feels himself preparing to leave \"all this,\" and he \"waves his hand sadly at his butterflies\" .","summary_analysis":"When Brown and Jim finally meet, Brown expresses hatred.  This hatred is, on some level, understandable.  He hates the world for never having given him the opportunity or the \"clean slate\" that Jim had been given.  When Brown and Jim face each other, each sees in the other a vision of what might have been.  The moment is one of recognition. Brown, the reader can surmise from subtle hints in the narrative, is a quick man.  He is charismatic enough to be a leader, albeit of an outcast group.  Still, his eye sees the hidden creek and, in the way that a great man senses another man's greatest weakness, Brown hits Jim in his weak spot.  He rouses in their interaction a sense of challenge.  Jim, now the embodiment of a mythical romantic ideal, begins to collapse.  The reason is less from a worry that Brown knows who Jim than the realization  that Jim will never be able to escape his moment of weakness on the Patna: his choice is part of his character, and his history is an integral part of his personality.  This history is not knowledge that is external to him, but something that has become deeply seated in his being.  Brown is a personification of that hidden and rejected self-knowledge. Jim likewise recognizes that Brown is a man who has potential or \"Ability in the abstract.\" In an attempt to pass along to him an opportunity in the same generous spirit with which Stein and Marlow had aided him, Jim gives Brown \"the clear road\"--not quite a clean slate, but a chance to achieve his goals.  This is an opportunity for Brown, though it is not nearly of the same quality as the one that had been given to Jim, because the clear road does not promise a realization of the romantic ideal, the achievement of the dreams of a life of glory and honor.  Instead, it is an opportunity for Brown to persist in his merely Darwinian-style struggle to survive.  The lesser opportunity here, however, is perhaps not so much a result of individual potential and character as it is a product of fortune or chance. The tragic conclusion ensues in a fog of mistrust.  Cornelius presses Brown to see the possibility of betrayal, though there is something in Brown that recognizes \"that there could be no treachery intended\" .  Brown is an astute judge of character.  Still, in the end, he acts mistrustful all the same, choosing to be retaliatory and violent.  These actions do more to reveal the true nature of his character.  Up the creek, and in secret, he wreaks havoc and death among Dain Waris's camp, and then escapes quickly. We again meet fairly clear evidence of Brown's character, should the story be true, that he is found at sea in a lifeboat telling the same story that the Patna crew had told their rescuers: the ship had sunk beneath their feet.  The irony in this tale, however, is that Jim had been one of them, as well as \"one of us.\"  Can Jim exorcise from himself the negative spirit that persists in Brown?  The ambiguity of character suggests that all men are mixtures of potential characters: the romantic, the hopeless, the corrupt, and the cowardly.  \"One of us\" can refer to being one more such complex being within the company of all men. As for Jim's fate, Dain Waris's death extinguishes the flame that had charmed the life of Patusan.  This parallel to Stein's best friend being assassinated is obvious, though in Jim's case, the death comes out of a failure of judgment on his part.  The ring, signifying the promise of good will from Stein to Doramin, becomes a symbol of betrayal.  Additionally, the death causes Jim's reputation and secure place in Patusan society to begin to crumble.  He has no place in the world beyond, and now that his work in Patusan is finished, there is nowhere for him to go, except to be extinguished himself. Therefore, as the reader recalls the vision of Stein blowing out a flaming match with the idea that all life is fleeting, Jim is compelled to do what is logically demanded at this climax.  He cannot fight in the way Brown had--struggling for his life--because to do so would liken him further to Brown.  Instead, he leaps in the direction of his fate.  He does not fight it. Jewel, representing the love that the community had felt for Jim and the delight of opportunity he had known, is discarded.  His final atonement requires a clean break.  Jim goes to meet Doramin with a calm face, in the same way that he had arrived, in the face of possible assault.  Here, the assault is certain, and Jim dies in a manner that atones for his past failure at sea.  This time, he goes down with the iron ship as it sinks.  He does not run.  He refuses to leap for a lifeboat to share with Jewel and Tamb' Itam.  Instead he remains--as George had remained--aboard, to die. The native audience looks at Jim's body, as the Muslim pilgrims had looked upon George's, with curiosity and fascination.  The mystery man of Patusan is brought to an end.  Jim is, after all, a man who dies, in spite of the myths of his immortality.  Nevertheless, in true Conradian fashion and poetic tradition, Jim lives on through his show of action.  He remains committed to his ideal and takes responsibility for what he has done and, in this way, Marlow finishes his story.  This man's story is worth finishing.  The inquiry into Jim's soul has been mysterious but it also has been fruitful, revelatory, and illustrative of what is human. The novel concludes with a final view of an aging Stein and a broken, mute Jewel.  The ring has been lost, and there is no one to inherit what Stein has built .  For Stein, the romantic tradition comes to an end.  As his hands wave at the butterflies beneath the glass, we sense that Stein, Jewel, the butterflies, everyone, all etherized in their places, will soon disintegrate into dust.","summary_length":794.0,"analysis_length":1071.0,"chap_int":45,"previous summary id":["chapter 44","chapter 44"],"previous chapter":["Before dawn, Brown and his group head downriver.

The town had a festive\nair; here and there men, still with spears or guns in their hands, could\nbe seen moving or standing on the shore in groups. Chinamen's shops had\nbeen opened early; but the market-place was empty, and a sentry, still\nposted at the corner of the fort, made out Tamb' Itam, and shouted to\nthose within. The gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam jumped ashore and ran\nin headlong. The first person he met was the girl coming down from the\nhouse.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, disordered, panting, with trembling lips and wild eyes,\nstood for a time before her as if a sudden spell had been laid on him.\nThen he broke out very quickly: \"They have killed Dain Waris and many\nmore.\" She clapped her hands, and her first words were, \"Shut the\ngates.\" Most of the fortmen had gone back to their houses, but Tamb'\nItam hurried on the few who remained for their turn of duty within. The\ngirl stood in the middle of the courtyard while the others ran about.\n\"Doramin,\" she cried despairingly, as Tamb' Itam passed her. Next time\nhe went by he answered her thought rapidly, \"Yes. But we have all the\npowder in Patusan.\" She caught him by the arm, and, pointing at the\nhouse, \"Call him out,\" she whispered, trembling.\n\n'Tamb' Itam ran up the steps. His master was sleeping. \"It is I, Tamb'\nItam,\" he cried at the door, \"with tidings that cannot wait.\" He saw\nJim turn over on the pillow and open his eyes, and he burst out at\nonce. \"This, Tuan, is a day of evil, an accursed day.\" His master raised\nhimself on his elbow to listen--just as Dain Waris had done. And then\nTamb' Itam began his tale, trying to relate the story in order, calling\nDain Waris Panglima, and saying: \"The Panglima then called out to the\nchief of his own boatmen, 'Give Tamb' Itam something to eat'\"--when\nhis master put his feet to the ground and looked at him with such a\ndiscomposed face that the words remained in his throat.\n\n'\"Speak out,\" said Jim. \"Is he dead?\" \"May you live long,\" cried Tamb'\nItam. \"It was a most cruel treachery. He ran out at the first shots and\nfell.\" . . . His master walked to the window and with his fist struck\nat the shutter. The room was made light; and then in a steady voice, but\nspeaking fast, he began to give him orders to assemble a fleet of boats\nfor immediate pursuit, go to this man, to the other--send messengers;\nand as he talked he sat down on the bed, stooping to lace his boots\nhurriedly, and suddenly looked up. \"Why do you stand here?\" he asked\nvery red-faced. \"Waste no time.\" Tamb' Itam did not move. \"Forgive me,\nTuan, but . . . but,\" he began to stammer. \"What?\" cried his master\naloud, looking terrible, leaning forward with his hands gripping the\nedge of the bed. \"It is not safe for thy servant to go out amongst the\npeople,\" said Tamb' Itam, after hesitating a moment.\n\n'Then Jim understood. He had retreated from one world, for a small\nmatter of an impulsive jump, and now the other, the work of his own\nhands, had fallen in ruins upon his head. It was not safe for his\nservant to go out amongst his own people! I believe that in that very\nmoment he had decided to defy the disaster in the only way it occurred\nto him such a disaster could be defied; but all I know is that, without\na word, he came out of his room and sat before the long table, at the\nhead of which he was accustomed to regulate the affairs of his world,\nproclaiming daily the truth that surely lived in his heart. The dark\npowers should not rob him twice of his peace. He sat like a stone\nfigure. Tamb' Itam, deferential, hinted at preparations for defence.\nThe girl he loved came in and spoke to him, but he made a sign with his\nhand, and she was awed by the dumb appeal for silence in it. She went\nout on the verandah and sat on the threshold, as if to guard him with\nher body from dangers outside.\n\n'What thoughts passed through his head--what memories? Who can tell?\nEverything was gone, and he who had been once unfaithful to his trust\nhad lost again all men's confidence. It was then, I believe, he tried\nto write--to somebody--and gave it up. Loneliness was closing on him.\nPeople had trusted him with their lives--only for that; and yet they\ncould never, as he had said, never be made to understand him. Those\nwithout did not hear him make a sound. Later, towards the evening, he\ncame to the door and called for Tamb' Itam. \"Well?\" he asked. \"There is\nmuch weeping. Much anger too,\" said Tamb' Itam. Jim looked up at him.\n\"You know,\" he murmured. \"Yes, Tuan,\" said Tamb' Itam. \"Thy servant does\nknow, and the gates are closed. We shall have to fight.\" \"Fight! What\nfor?\" he asked. \"For our lives.\" \"I have no life,\" he said. Tamb' Itam\nheard a cry from the girl at the door. \"Who knows?\" said Tamb' Itam.\n\"By audacity and cunning we may even escape. There is much fear in men's\nhearts too.\" He went out, thinking vaguely of boats and of open sea,\nleaving Jim and the girl together.\n\n'I haven't the heart to set down here such glimpses as she had given\nme of the hour or more she passed in there wrestling with him for the\npossession of her happiness. Whether he had any hope--what he expected,\nwhat he imagined--it is impossible to say. He was inflexible, and with\nthe growing loneliness of his obstinacy his spirit seemed to rise above\nthe ruins of his existence. She cried \"Fight!\" into his ear. She could\nnot understand. There was nothing to fight for. He was going to prove\nhis power in another way and conquer the fatal destiny itself. He came\nout into the courtyard, and behind him, with streaming hair, wild\nof face, breathless, she staggered out and leaned on the side of the\ndoorway. \"Open the gates,\" he ordered. Afterwards, turning to those of\nhis men who were inside, he gave them leave to depart to their homes.\n\"For how long, Tuan?\" asked one of them timidly. \"For all life,\" he\nsaid, in a sombre tone.\n\n'A hush had fallen upon the town after the outburst of wailing and\nlamentation that had swept over the river, like a gust of wind from the\nopened abode of sorrow. But rumours flew in whispers, filling the hearts\nwith consternation and horrible doubts. The robbers were coming back,\nbringing many others with them, in a great ship, and there would be no\nrefuge in the land for any one. A sense of utter insecurity as during\nan earthquake pervaded the minds of men, who whispered their suspicions,\nlooking at each other as if in the presence of some awful portent.\n\n'The sun was sinking towards the forests when Dain Waris's body was\nbrought into Doramin's campong. Four men carried it in, covered decently\nwith a white sheet which the old mother had sent out down to the gate to\nmeet her son on his return. They laid him at Doramin's feet, and the old\nman sat still for a long time, one hand on each knee, looking down. The\nfronds of palms swayed gently, and the foliage of fruit trees stirred\nabove his head. Every single man of his people was there, fully armed,\nwhen the old nakhoda at last raised his eyes. He moved them slowly over\nthe crowd, as if seeking for a missing face. Again his chin sank on his\nbreast. The whispers of many men mingled with the slight rustling of the\nleaves.\n\n'The Malay who had brought Tamb' Itam and the girl to Samarang was there\ntoo. \"Not so angry as many,\" he said to me, but struck with a great\nawe and wonder at the \"suddenness of men's fate, which hangs over their\nheads like a cloud charged with thunder.\" He told me that when Dain\nWaris's body was uncovered at a sign of Doramin's, he whom they often\ncalled the white lord's friend was disclosed lying unchanged with his\neyelids a little open as if about to wake. Doramin leaned forward a\nlittle more, like one looking for something fallen on the ground. His\neyes searched the body from its feet to its head, for the wound maybe.\nIt was in the forehead and small; and there was no word spoken while\none of the by-standers, stooping, took off the silver ring from the cold\nstiff hand. In silence he held it up before Doramin. A murmur of dismay\nand horror ran through the crowd at the sight of that familiar token.\nThe old nakhoda stared at it, and suddenly let out one great fierce cry,\ndeep from the chest, a roar of pain and fury, as mighty as the bellow of\na wounded bull, bringing great fear into men's hearts, by the magnitude\nof his anger and his sorrow that could be plainly discerned without\nwords. There was a great stillness afterwards for a space, while the\nbody was being borne aside by four men. They laid it down under a tree,\nand on the instant, with one long shriek, all the women of the household\nbegan to wail together; they mourned with shrill cries; the sun\nwas setting, and in the intervals of screamed lamentations the high\nsing-song voices of two old men intoning the Koran chanted alone.\n\n'About this time Jim, leaning on a gun-carriage, looked at the river,\nand turned his back on the house; and the girl, in the doorway, panting\nas if she had run herself to a standstill, was looking at him across the\nyard. Tamb' Itam stood not far from his master, waiting patiently for\nwhat might happen. All at once Jim, who seemed to be lost in quiet\nthought, turned to him and said, \"Time to finish this.\"\n\n'\"Tuan?\" said Tamb' Itam, advancing with alacrity. He did not know what\nhis master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started\ntoo and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of\nthe people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about\nhalf-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful\ncontemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against\nthe gun. \"Will you fight?\" she cried. \"There is nothing to fight for,\"\nhe said; \"nothing is lost.\" Saying this he made a step towards her.\n\"Will you fly?\" she cried again. \"There is no escape,\" he said, stopping\nshort, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes.\n\"And you shall go?\" she said slowly. He bent his head. \"Ah!\" she\nexclaimed, peering at him as it were, \"you are mad or false. Do you\nremember the night I prayed you to leave me, and you said that you could\nnot? That it was impossible! Impossible! Do you remember you said you\nwould never leave me? Why? I asked you for no promise. You promised\nunasked--remember.\" \"Enough, poor girl,\" he said. \"I should not be worth\nhaving.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam said that while they were talking she would laugh loud and\nsenselessly like one under the visitation of God. His master put his\nhands to his head. He was fully dressed as for every day, but without\na hat. She stopped laughing suddenly. \"For the last time,\" she cried\nmenacingly, \"will you defend yourself?\" \"Nothing can touch me,\" he said\nin a last flicker of superb egoism. Tamb' Itam saw her lean forward\nwhere she stood, open her arms, and run at him swiftly. She flung\nherself upon his breast and clasped him round the neck.\n\n'\"Ah! but I shall hold thee thus,\" she cried. . . . \"Thou art mine!\"\n\n'She sobbed on his shoulder. The sky over Patusan was blood-red,\nimmense, streaming like an open vein. An enormous sun nestled crimson\namongst the tree-tops, and the forest below had a black and forbidding\nface.\n\n'Tamb' Itam tells me that on that evening the aspect of the heavens was\nangry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know that on that very\nday a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was\nhardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.\n\n'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim catch her arms, trying to unclasp her\nhands. She hung on them with her head fallen back; her hair touched the\nground. \"Come here!\" his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped to ease\nher down. It was difficult to separate her fingers. Jim, bending\nover her, looked earnestly upon her face, and all at once ran to the\nlanding-stage. Tamb' Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw\nthat she had struggled up to her feet. She ran after them a few steps,\nthen fell down heavily on her knees. \"Tuan! Tuan!\" called Tamb' Itam,\n\"look back;\" but Jim was already in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand.\nHe did not look back. Tamb' Itam had just time to scramble in after\nhim when the canoe floated clear. The girl was then on her knees, with\nclasped hands, at the water-gate. She remained thus for a time in\na supplicating attitude before she sprang up. \"You are false!\" she\nscreamed out after Jim. \"Forgive me,\" he cried. \"Never! Never!\" she\ncalled back.\n\n'Tamb' Itam took the paddle from Jim's hands, it being unseemly that he\nshould sit while his lord paddled. When they reached the other shore his\nmaster forbade him to come any farther; but Tamb' Itam did follow him at\na distance, walking up the slope to Doramin's campong.\n\n'It was beginning to grow dark. Torches twinkled here and there. Those\nthey met seemed awestruck, and stood aside hastily to let Jim pass. The\nwailing of women came from above. The courtyard was full of armed Bugis\nwith their followers, and of Patusan people.\n\n'I do not know what this gathering really meant. Were these preparations\nfor war, or for vengeance, or to repulse a threatened invasion? Many\ndays elapsed before the people had ceased to look out, quaking, for\nthe return of the white men with long beards and in rags, whose exact\nrelation to their own white man they could never understand. Even for\nthose simple minds poor Jim remains under a cloud.\n\n'Doramin, alone! immense and desolate, sat in his arm-chair with the\npair of flintlock pistols on his knees, faced by a armed throng. When\nJim appeared, at somebody's exclamation, all the heads turned round\ntogether, and then the mass opened right and left, and he walked up a\nlane of averted glances. Whispers followed him; murmurs: \"He has worked\nall the evil.\" \"He hath a charm.\" . . . He heard them--perhaps!\n\n'When he came up into the light of torches the wailing of the women\nceased suddenly. Doramin did not lift his head, and Jim stood silent\nbefore him for a time. Then he looked to the left, and moved in that\ndirection with measured steps. Dain Waris's mother crouched at the head\nof the body, and the grey dishevelled hair concealed her face. Jim came\nup slowly, looked at his dead friend, lifting the sheet, than dropped it\nwithout a word. Slowly he walked back.\n\n'\"He came! He came!\" was running from lip to lip, making a murmur to\nwhich he moved. \"He hath taken it upon his own head,\" a voice said\naloud. He heard this and turned to the crowd. \"Yes. Upon my head.\" A few\npeople recoiled. Jim waited awhile before Doramin, and then said gently,\n\"I am come in sorrow.\" He waited again. \"I am come ready and unarmed,\"\nhe repeated.\n\n'The unwieldy old man, lowering his big forehead like an ox under a\nyoke, made an effort to rise, clutching at the flintlock pistols on his\nknees. From his throat came gurgling, choking, inhuman sounds, and his\ntwo attendants helped him from behind. People remarked that the ring\nwhich he had dropped on his lap fell and rolled against the foot of\nthe white man, and that poor Jim glanced down at the talisman that had\nopened for him the door of fame, love, and success within the wall of\nforests fringed with white foam, within the coast that under the western\nsun looks like the very stronghold of the night. Doramin, struggling to\nkeep his feet, made with his two supporters a swaying, tottering group;\nhis little eyes stared with an expression of mad pain, of rage, with\na ferocious glitter, which the bystanders noticed; and then, while Jim\nstood stiffened and with bared head in the light of torches, looking him\nstraight in the face, he clung heavily with his left arm round the neck\nof a bowed youth, and lifting deliberately his right, shot his son's\nfriend through the chest.\n\n'The crowd, which had fallen apart behind Jim as soon as Doramin had\nraised his hand, rushed tumultuously forward after the shot. They say\nthat the white man sent right and left at all those faces a proud and\nunflinching glance. Then with his hand over his lips he fell forward,\ndead.\n\n'And that's the end. He passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart,\nforgotten, unforgiven, and excessively romantic. Not in the wildest days\nof his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring shape of such an\nextraordinary success! For it may very well be that in the short moment\nof his last proud and unflinching glance, he had beheld the face of that\nopportunity which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side.\n\n'But we can see him, an obscure conqueror of fame, tearing himself out\nof the arms of a jealous love at the sign, at the call of his exalted\negoism. He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless\nwedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct. Is he satisfied--quite, now, I\nwonder? We ought to know. He is one of us--and have I not stood up once,\nlike an evoked ghost, to answer for his eternal constancy? Was I so very\nwrong after all? Now he is no more, there are days when the reality of\nhis existence comes to me with an immense, with an overwhelming force;\nand yet upon my honour there are moments, too when he passes from my\neyes like a disembodied spirit astray amongst the passions of this\nearth, ready to surrender himself faithfully to the claim of his own\nworld of shades.\n\n'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and the poor girl is\nleading a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has\naged greatly of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is\n\"preparing to leave all this; preparing to leave . . .\" while he waves\nhis hand sadly at his butterflies.'","chapter_length":2980.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 45","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210118112654\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/lord-jim\/summary\/chapter-45","summary_text":"A rattled Tamb' Itam makes his way back to the village.

Meanwhile, Tamb' ltam reached Dain Waris' camp and was immediately taken to Dain Waris, who was resting on a raised couch made of bamboo. Tamb' Itam handed him the silver ring from Lord Jim. Brown and the white men, he said, \\\"were to be allowed to pass down the river.\\\" Dain Waris listened attentively, then slipped on Jim's ring and gave orders to prepare breakfast and make ready for the return in the afternoon. Then he lay back down and watched the sun eat up the mist and the fog. It was then that Brown took his revenge. It was, says Marlow, an act of cold-blooded ferocity,\\\" and it seemed all the worse later. Brown used the memory of it to \\\"console\\\" himself as he lay on his deathbed. Brown landed his men on the other side of the island opposite Dain Waris' camp and Cornelius led the way to the Bugis' camp. The Bugis were in plain sight. No one guessed that the white men knew about the narrow channel behind the camp. At the precise moment, Brown yelled out, \\\"Let them have it,\\\" and fourteen shots rang out. For a moment, not a soul moved. Then blind panic drove them wildly to and fro on the shore like a herd of frightened cattle. Three times Brown's men fired into the Bugis' camp. Tamb' Itam dropped immediately and lay as if he were dead. He told Marlow that after the first volley of shots, Dain Waris raised up from his couch and received a bullet in his forehead. In a few minutes, the white men vanished. A month later, three parched, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons, one of whom said his name was Brown, were picked up in the Indian Ocean. Brown, of course, lived and was interviewed by Marlow. Tamb' ltam told Marlow that Brown did not take Cornelius with him. Cornelius was seen running among the Bugis corpses, uttering little confused cries. Tamb' Itam caught him and stabbed him twice. Then Cornelius \\\"screeched like a frightened hen,\\\" Tamb' Itam says, and so he shoved his spear through him and \\\"life went out of his eyes.\\\" Immediately thereafter, Tamb' Itam left for the fort to report to the Bugis what had happened to Dain Waris and his men. The town of Patusan had a festive air. The women were crowded together in throngs, waiting for the return of Dain Waris and his men. The city gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam was panting and trembling when he finally reached the town. He saw Jewel, and he mumbled half-coherently to her what had happened during Brown's ambush. Then he ran to Jim's house. Jim was sleeping, but when he saw the confused state that Tamb' Itam was in, he wanted the truth: was Dain Waris dead? When he learned the tragic news, he immediately gave orders for Tamb' ltam to assemble boats, but Jim's bodyguard told him that after Dain Waris was killed, it was no longer safe for Jim's \\\"servant to go out amongst the people.\\\" Jim understood. His world had fallen in ruins. Everything was lost -- particularly the confidence that the Bugis had once placed in Jim. Loneliness closed in on Jim. The people had trusted him with their lives, and he had failed them. There was much weeping among the people, but there was more anger within them. The sun was sinking above the forest when Dain Waris' body was brought into Doramin's compound. The body was laid under a tree, and all of the women began to wail, mourning in shrill cries and screaming in high, singsong lamentations. Both Tamb' Itam and Jewel urged Jim either to make a stand or to try to escape, but Jim refused. \\\"I have no life,\\\" Jim told Tamb' Itam and Jewel. The girl begged Jim to fight, but Jim could not. \\\"Forgive me,\\\" he told Jewel, but she could not. \\\"Never, never!\\\" she screamed after him. Neither she nor Tamb' Itam could understand Jim's code of honor. Jim went to old Doramin and told him that he had come \\\"in sorrow . . . ready and unarmed.\\\" Doramin struggled to his feet, helped up by his attendants, and as he rose, the silver ring that he had taken off Dain Waris' finger slipped off his lap and rolled forward toward Jim's feet. Here was \\\"the talisman that had opened for him the door of fame, love, and success.\\\" Jim looked up and saw that Doramin was aiming a pistol directly at his chest. He looked at the old nakhoda with \\\"proud and unflinching\\\" eyes. Doramin fired, and Jim fell forward. \\\"And that's the end,\\\" writes Marlow. Even today, Jim remains a mystery to the girl and to Tamb' Itam. But, to Marlow, Jim is not a total mystery. It is true, Marlow says, that Jim passed away \\\"under a cloud, inscrutable . . . and excessively romantic,\\\" for not even in his boyhood days could Jim have dreamed such a romantic destiny for himself -- and yet that is exactly what he wanted most in life. But ultimately, Marlow said, Jim was not so different. He was, still, even at the end, \\\"one of us.\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"These last two chapters are filled with more action per se than any of the other chapters. We see the attack, the panic caused among the Bugis, the death of Dain Waris, Tamb' Itam's killing of Cornelius and then his quick flight back to Lord Jim, and after Jim's confrontation with Jewel, concerning whether or not to fight, we see Lord Jim go to meet Doramin with the full knowledge of his impending death. These final chapters show the penultimate treachery of \\\"Gentleman Brown\\\" -- his \\\"act of cold-blooded ferocity.\\\" What happened, Marlow says, was a lesson -- \\\"a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our nature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we like to think.\\\" Marlow seems to be implying that just as all men are capable of \\\"Jumping\\\" , likewise, all men are also capable of some sort of treachery, as performed by Brown. Certainly, Brown himself implied the same theory to Lord Jim, an idea so unnerving that it caused Jim to fail to see Brown's treachery clearly. However, Brown exceeds all decency when he gloats on his deathbed about the havoc that he wreaked upon Lord Jim. In his last moments on earth, Brown rejoiced that Lord Jim was ultimately killed. When Lord Jim climbs up to Doramin's village to face certain death, he climbs back all of the way that he had \\\"jumped\\\" when he deserted the Patna. Jim has conquered fear and shame. He has discovered the chance he waited for, the opportunity to restore to himself his own vision of himself. Jewel can never understand Jim's decision not to fight and as we have seen earlier at Stein's, she will never forgive Jim because she fully believes that he, like all white men, has deliberately deserted her. Her last words to him as he walks toward Doramin are: \\\"You are false!\\\" She screams these words to Jim, who asks her forgiveness. \\\"Never! Never!\\\" she calls back. Unfortunately, Jewel will never understand Lord Jim's moral position. He had no choice. Morally, Jim had to prove his worth to himself; fighting had nothing to do with the honor which he had to try and find within himself. Jim promised safety for his people if they would let Brown go, and he offered his life as proof that they could trust Brown. Now Dain Waris and many others are dead. Jim had to offer his own life in payment. He was a Lord to his people, and he had to give his life when it was necessary. This time, Jim did not flee, and he did not jump. He had conquered fear and shame, and he met death as a hero would. He made a bargain with the human community, a community he once deserted, and he paid for its trust with his life. At last, Jim became the master of his own destiny.\"}","chapter":"\n'I don't think they spoke together again. The boat entered a narrow\nby-channel, where it was pushed by the oar-blades set into crumbling\nbanks, and there was a gloom as if enormous black wings had been\noutspread above the mist that filled its depth to the summits of the\ntrees. The branches overhead showered big drops through the gloomy fog.\nAt a mutter from Cornelius, Brown ordered his men to load. \"I'll\ngive you a chance to get even with them before we're done, you dismal\ncripples, you,\" he said to his gang. \"Mind you don't throw it away--you\nhounds.\" Low growls answered that speech. Cornelius showed much fussy\nconcern for the safety of his canoe.\n\n'Meantime Tamb' Itam had reached the end of his journey. The fog had\ndelayed him a little, but he had paddled steadily, keeping in touch with\nthe south bank. By-and-by daylight came like a glow in a ground glass\nglobe. The shores made on each side of the river a dark smudge, in which\none could detect hints of columnar forms and shadows of twisted branches\nhigh up. The mist was still thick on the water, but a good watch was\nbeing kept, for as Iamb' Itam approached the camp the figures of two men\nemerged out of the white vapour, and voices spoke to him boisterously.\nHe answered, and presently a canoe lay alongside, and he exchanged news\nwith the paddlers. All was well. The trouble was over. Then the men in\nthe canoe let go their grip on the side of his dug-out and incontinently\nfell out of sight. He pursued his way till he heard voices coming to him\nquietly over the water, and saw, under the now lifting, swirling mist,\nthe glow of many little fires burning on a sandy stretch, backed by\nlofty thin timber and bushes. There again a look-out was kept, for he\nwas challenged. He shouted his name as the two last sweeps of his paddle\nran his canoe up on the strand. It was a big camp. Men crouched in many\nlittle knots under a subdued murmur of early morning talk. Many thin\nthreads of smoke curled slowly on the white mist. Little shelters,\nelevated above the ground, had been built for the chiefs. Muskets were\nstacked in small pyramids, and long spears were stuck singly into the\nsand near the fires.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, assuming an air of importance, demanded to be led to Dain\nWaris. He found the friend of his white lord lying on a raised couch\nmade of bamboo, and sheltered by a sort of shed of sticks covered with\nmats. Dain Waris was awake, and a bright fire was burning before his\nsleeping-place, which resembled a rude shrine. The only son of nakhoda\nDoramin answered his greeting kindly. Tamb' Itam began by handing him\nthe ring which vouched for the truth of the messenger's words. Dain\nWaris, reclining on his elbow, bade him speak and tell all the news.\nBeginning with the consecrated formula, \"The news is good,\" Tamb' Itam\ndelivered Jim's own words. The white men, deputing with the consent of\nall the chiefs, were to be allowed to pass down the river. In answer to\na question or two Tamb' Itam then reported the proceedings of the last\ncouncil. Dain Waris listened attentively to the end, toying with the\nring which ultimately he slipped on the forefinger of his right hand.\nAfter hearing all he had to say he dismissed Tamb' Itam to have food\nand rest. Orders for the return in the afternoon were given immediately.\nAfterwards Dain Waris lay down again, open-eyed, while his personal\nattendants were preparing his food at the fire, by which Tamb' Itam also\nsat talking to the men who lounged up to hear the latest intelligence\nfrom the town. The sun was eating up the mist. A good watch was kept\nupon the reach of the main stream where the boat of the whites was\nexpected to appear every moment.\n\n'It was then that Brown took his revenge upon the world which, after\ntwenty years of contemptuous and reckless bullying, refused him the\ntribute of a common robber's success. It was an act of cold-blooded\nferocity, and it consoled him on his deathbed like a memory of an\nindomitable defiance. Stealthily he landed his men on the other side\nof the island opposite to the Bugis camp, and led them across. After a\nshort but quite silent scuffle, Cornelius, who had tried to slink away\nat the moment of landing, resigned himself to show the way where the\nundergrowth was most sparse. Brown held both his skinny hands together\nbehind his back in the grip of one vast fist, and now and then impelled\nhim forward with a fierce push. Cornelius remained as mute as a fish,\nabject but faithful to his purpose, whose accomplishment loomed before\nhim dimly. At the edge of the patch of forest Brown's men spread\nthemselves out in cover and waited. The camp was plain from end to end\nbefore their eyes, and no one looked their way. Nobody even dreamed that\nthe white men could have any knowledge of the narrow channel at the back\nof the island. When he judged the moment come, Brown yelled, \"Let them\nhave it,\" and fourteen shots rang out like one.\n\n'Tamb' Itam told me the surprise was so great that, except for those who\nfell dead or wounded, not a soul of them moved for quite an appreciable\ntime after the first discharge. Then a man screamed, and after that\nscream a great yell of amazement and fear went up from all the throats.\nA blind panic drove these men in a surging swaying mob to and fro along\nthe shore like a herd of cattle afraid of the water. Some few jumped\ninto the river then, but most of them did so only after the last\ndischarge. Three times Brown's men fired into the ruck, Brown, the only\none in view, cursing and yelling, \"Aim low! aim low!\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam says that, as for him, he understood at the first volley\nwhat had happened. Though untouched he fell down and lay as if dead,\nbut with his eyes open. At the sound of the first shots Dain Waris,\nreclining on the couch, jumped up and ran out upon the open shore, just\nin time to receive a bullet in his forehead at the second discharge.\nTamb' Itam saw him fling his arms wide open before he fell. Then, he\nsays, a great fear came upon him--not before. The white men retired as\nthey had come--unseen.\n\n'Thus Brown balanced his account with the evil fortune. Notice that even\nin this awful outbreak there is a superiority as of a man who carries\nright--the abstract thing--within the envelope of his common desires.\nIt was not a vulgar and treacherous massacre; it was a lesson, a\nretribution--a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our\nnature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we\nlike to think.\n\n'Afterwards the whites depart unseen by Tamb' Itam, and seem to vanish\nfrom before men's eyes altogether; and the schooner, too, vanishes after\nthe manner of stolen goods. But a story is told of a white long-boat\npicked up a month later in the Indian Ocean by a cargo steamer. Two\nparched, yellow, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons in her recognised\nthe authority of a third, who declared that his name was Brown. His\nschooner, he reported, bound south with a cargo of Java sugar, had\nsprung a bad leak and sank under his feet. He and his companions were\nthe survivors of a crew of six. The two died on board the steamer which\nrescued them. Brown lived to be seen by me, and I can testify that he\nhad played his part to the last.\n\n'It seems, however, that in going away they had neglected to cast off\nCornelius's canoe. Cornelius himself Brown had let go at the beginning\nof the shooting, with a kick for a parting benediction. Tamb' Itam,\nafter arising from amongst the dead, saw the Nazarene running up and\ndown the shore amongst the corpses and the expiring fires. He uttered\nlittle cries. Suddenly he rushed to the water, and made frantic efforts\nto get one of the Bugis boats into the water. \"Afterwards, till he had\nseen me,\" related Tamb' Itam, \"he stood looking at the heavy canoe and\nscratching his head.\" \"What became of him?\" I asked. Tamb' Itam, staring\nhard at me, made an expressive gesture with his right arm. \"Twice I\nstruck, Tuan,\" he said. \"When he beheld me approaching he cast himself\nviolently on the ground and made a great outcry, kicking. He screeched\nlike a frightened hen till he felt the point; then he was still, and lay\nstaring at me while his life went out of his eyes.\"\n\n'This done, Tamb' Itam did not tarry. He understood the importance of\nbeing the first with the awful news at the fort. There were, of course,\nmany survivors of Dain Waris's party; but in the extremity of panic some\nhad swum across the river, others had bolted into the bush. The fact is\nthat they did not know really who struck that blow--whether more white\nrobbers were not coming, whether they had not already got hold of\nthe whole land. They imagined themselves to be the victims of a vast\ntreachery, and utterly doomed to destruction. It is said that some small\nparties did not come in till three days afterwards. However, a few tried\nto make their way back to Patusan at once, and one of the canoes that\nwere patrolling the river that morning was in sight of the camp at\nthe very moment of the attack. It is true that at first the men in her\nleaped overboard and swam to the opposite bank, but afterwards they\nreturned to their boat and started fearfully up-stream. Of these Tamb'\nItam had an hour's advance.''When Tamb' Itam, paddling madly, came into the town-reach, the women,\nthronging the platforms before the houses, were looking out for the\nreturn of Dain Waris's little fleet of boats. The town had a festive\nair; here and there men, still with spears or guns in their hands, could\nbe seen moving or standing on the shore in groups. Chinamen's shops had\nbeen opened early; but the market-place was empty, and a sentry, still\nposted at the corner of the fort, made out Tamb' Itam, and shouted to\nthose within. The gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam jumped ashore and ran\nin headlong. The first person he met was the girl coming down from the\nhouse.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, disordered, panting, with trembling lips and wild eyes,\nstood for a time before her as if a sudden spell had been laid on him.\nThen he broke out very quickly: \"They have killed Dain Waris and many\nmore.\" She clapped her hands, and her first words were, \"Shut the\ngates.\" Most of the fortmen had gone back to their houses, but Tamb'\nItam hurried on the few who remained for their turn of duty within. The\ngirl stood in the middle of the courtyard while the others ran about.\n\"Doramin,\" she cried despairingly, as Tamb' Itam passed her. Next time\nhe went by he answered her thought rapidly, \"Yes. But we have all the\npowder in Patusan.\" She caught him by the arm, and, pointing at the\nhouse, \"Call him out,\" she whispered, trembling.\n\n'Tamb' Itam ran up the steps. His master was sleeping. \"It is I, Tamb'\nItam,\" he cried at the door, \"with tidings that cannot wait.\" He saw\nJim turn over on the pillow and open his eyes, and he burst out at\nonce. \"This, Tuan, is a day of evil, an accursed day.\" His master raised\nhimself on his elbow to listen--just as Dain Waris had done. And then\nTamb' Itam began his tale, trying to relate the story in order, calling\nDain Waris Panglima, and saying: \"The Panglima then called out to the\nchief of his own boatmen, 'Give Tamb' Itam something to eat'\"--when\nhis master put his feet to the ground and looked at him with such a\ndiscomposed face that the words remained in his throat.\n\n'\"Speak out,\" said Jim. \"Is he dead?\" \"May you live long,\" cried Tamb'\nItam. \"It was a most cruel treachery. He ran out at the first shots and\nfell.\" . . . His master walked to the window and with his fist struck\nat the shutter. The room was made light; and then in a steady voice, but\nspeaking fast, he began to give him orders to assemble a fleet of boats\nfor immediate pursuit, go to this man, to the other--send messengers;\nand as he talked he sat down on the bed, stooping to lace his boots\nhurriedly, and suddenly looked up. \"Why do you stand here?\" he asked\nvery red-faced. \"Waste no time.\" Tamb' Itam did not move. \"Forgive me,\nTuan, but . . . but,\" he began to stammer. \"What?\" cried his master\naloud, looking terrible, leaning forward with his hands gripping the\nedge of the bed. \"It is not safe for thy servant to go out amongst the\npeople,\" said Tamb' Itam, after hesitating a moment.\n\n'Then Jim understood. He had retreated from one world, for a small\nmatter of an impulsive jump, and now the other, the work of his own\nhands, had fallen in ruins upon his head. It was not safe for his\nservant to go out amongst his own people! I believe that in that very\nmoment he had decided to defy the disaster in the only way it occurred\nto him such a disaster could be defied; but all I know is that, without\na word, he came out of his room and sat before the long table, at the\nhead of which he was accustomed to regulate the affairs of his world,\nproclaiming daily the truth that surely lived in his heart. The dark\npowers should not rob him twice of his peace. He sat like a stone\nfigure. Tamb' Itam, deferential, hinted at preparations for defence.\nThe girl he loved came in and spoke to him, but he made a sign with his\nhand, and she was awed by the dumb appeal for silence in it. She went\nout on the verandah and sat on the threshold, as if to guard him with\nher body from dangers outside.\n\n'What thoughts passed through his head--what memories? Who can tell?\nEverything was gone, and he who had been once unfaithful to his trust\nhad lost again all men's confidence. It was then, I believe, he tried\nto write--to somebody--and gave it up. Loneliness was closing on him.\nPeople had trusted him with their lives--only for that; and yet they\ncould never, as he had said, never be made to understand him. Those\nwithout did not hear him make a sound. Later, towards the evening, he\ncame to the door and called for Tamb' Itam. \"Well?\" he asked. \"There is\nmuch weeping. Much anger too,\" said Tamb' Itam. Jim looked up at him.\n\"You know,\" he murmured. \"Yes, Tuan,\" said Tamb' Itam. \"Thy servant does\nknow, and the gates are closed. We shall have to fight.\" \"Fight! What\nfor?\" he asked. \"For our lives.\" \"I have no life,\" he said. Tamb' Itam\nheard a cry from the girl at the door. \"Who knows?\" said Tamb' Itam.\n\"By audacity and cunning we may even escape. There is much fear in men's\nhearts too.\" He went out, thinking vaguely of boats and of open sea,\nleaving Jim and the girl together.\n\n'I haven't the heart to set down here such glimpses as she had given\nme of the hour or more she passed in there wrestling with him for the\npossession of her happiness. Whether he had any hope--what he expected,\nwhat he imagined--it is impossible to say. He was inflexible, and with\nthe growing loneliness of his obstinacy his spirit seemed to rise above\nthe ruins of his existence. She cried \"Fight!\" into his ear. She could\nnot understand. There was nothing to fight for. He was going to prove\nhis power in another way and conquer the fatal destiny itself. He came\nout into the courtyard, and behind him, with streaming hair, wild\nof face, breathless, she staggered out and leaned on the side of the\ndoorway. \"Open the gates,\" he ordered. Afterwards, turning to those of\nhis men who were inside, he gave them leave to depart to their homes.\n\"For how long, Tuan?\" asked one of them timidly. \"For all life,\" he\nsaid, in a sombre tone.\n\n'A hush had fallen upon the town after the outburst of wailing and\nlamentation that had swept over the river, like a gust of wind from the\nopened abode of sorrow. But rumours flew in whispers, filling the hearts\nwith consternation and horrible doubts. The robbers were coming back,\nbringing many others with them, in a great ship, and there would be no\nrefuge in the land for any one. A sense of utter insecurity as during\nan earthquake pervaded the minds of men, who whispered their suspicions,\nlooking at each other as if in the presence of some awful portent.\n\n'The sun was sinking towards the forests when Dain Waris's body was\nbrought into Doramin's campong. Four men carried it in, covered decently\nwith a white sheet which the old mother had sent out down to the gate to\nmeet her son on his return. They laid him at Doramin's feet, and the old\nman sat still for a long time, one hand on each knee, looking down. The\nfronds of palms swayed gently, and the foliage of fruit trees stirred\nabove his head. Every single man of his people was there, fully armed,\nwhen the old nakhoda at last raised his eyes. He moved them slowly over\nthe crowd, as if seeking for a missing face. Again his chin sank on his\nbreast. The whispers of many men mingled with the slight rustling of the\nleaves.\n\n'The Malay who had brought Tamb' Itam and the girl to Samarang was there\ntoo. \"Not so angry as many,\" he said to me, but struck with a great\nawe and wonder at the \"suddenness of men's fate, which hangs over their\nheads like a cloud charged with thunder.\" He told me that when Dain\nWaris's body was uncovered at a sign of Doramin's, he whom they often\ncalled the white lord's friend was disclosed lying unchanged with his\neyelids a little open as if about to wake. Doramin leaned forward a\nlittle more, like one looking for something fallen on the ground. His\neyes searched the body from its feet to its head, for the wound maybe.\nIt was in the forehead and small; and there was no word spoken while\none of the by-standers, stooping, took off the silver ring from the cold\nstiff hand. In silence he held it up before Doramin. A murmur of dismay\nand horror ran through the crowd at the sight of that familiar token.\nThe old nakhoda stared at it, and suddenly let out one great fierce cry,\ndeep from the chest, a roar of pain and fury, as mighty as the bellow of\na wounded bull, bringing great fear into men's hearts, by the magnitude\nof his anger and his sorrow that could be plainly discerned without\nwords. There was a great stillness afterwards for a space, while the\nbody was being borne aside by four men. They laid it down under a tree,\nand on the instant, with one long shriek, all the women of the household\nbegan to wail together; they mourned with shrill cries; the sun\nwas setting, and in the intervals of screamed lamentations the high\nsing-song voices of two old men intoning the Koran chanted alone.\n\n'About this time Jim, leaning on a gun-carriage, looked at the river,\nand turned his back on the house; and the girl, in the doorway, panting\nas if she had run herself to a standstill, was looking at him across the\nyard. Tamb' Itam stood not far from his master, waiting patiently for\nwhat might happen. All at once Jim, who seemed to be lost in quiet\nthought, turned to him and said, \"Time to finish this.\"\n\n'\"Tuan?\" said Tamb' Itam, advancing with alacrity. He did not know what\nhis master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started\ntoo and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of\nthe people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about\nhalf-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful\ncontemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against\nthe gun. \"Will you fight?\" she cried. \"There is nothing to fight for,\"\nhe said; \"nothing is lost.\" Saying this he made a step towards her.\n\"Will you fly?\" she cried again. \"There is no escape,\" he said, stopping\nshort, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes.\n\"And you shall go?\" she said slowly. He bent his head. \"Ah!\" she\nexclaimed, peering at him as it were, \"you are mad or false. Do you\nremember the night I prayed you to leave me, and you said that you could\nnot? That it was impossible! Impossible! Do you remember you said you\nwould never leave me? Why? I asked you for no promise. You promised\nunasked--remember.\" \"Enough, poor girl,\" he said. \"I should not be worth\nhaving.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam said that while they were talking she would laugh loud and\nsenselessly like one under the visitation of God. His master put his\nhands to his head. He was fully dressed as for every day, but without\na hat. She stopped laughing suddenly. \"For the last time,\" she cried\nmenacingly, \"will you defend yourself?\" \"Nothing can touch me,\" he said\nin a last flicker of superb egoism. Tamb' Itam saw her lean forward\nwhere she stood, open her arms, and run at him swiftly. She flung\nherself upon his breast and clasped him round the neck.\n\n'\"Ah! but I shall hold thee thus,\" she cried. . . . \"Thou art mine!\"\n\n'She sobbed on his shoulder. The sky over Patusan was blood-red,\nimmense, streaming like an open vein. An enormous sun nestled crimson\namongst the tree-tops, and the forest below had a black and forbidding\nface.\n\n'Tamb' Itam tells me that on that evening the aspect of the heavens was\nangry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know that on that very\nday a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was\nhardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.\n\n'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim catch her arms, trying to unclasp her\nhands. She hung on them with her head fallen back; her hair touched the\nground. \"Come here!\" his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped to ease\nher down. It was difficult to separate her fingers. Jim, bending\nover her, looked earnestly upon her face, and all at once ran to the\nlanding-stage. Tamb' Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw\nthat she had struggled up to her feet. She ran after them a few steps,\nthen fell down heavily on her knees. \"Tuan! Tuan!\" called Tamb' Itam,\n\"look back;\" but Jim was already in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand.\nHe did not look back. Tamb' Itam had just time to scramble in after\nhim when the canoe floated clear. The girl was then on her knees, with\nclasped hands, at the water-gate. She remained thus for a time in\na supplicating attitude before she sprang up. \"You are false!\" she\nscreamed out after Jim. \"Forgive me,\" he cried. \"Never! Never!\" she\ncalled back.\n\n'Tamb' Itam took the paddle from Jim's hands, it being unseemly that he\nshould sit while his lord paddled. When they reached the other shore his\nmaster forbade him to come any farther; but Tamb' Itam did follow him at\na distance, walking up the slope to Doramin's campong.\n\n'It was beginning to grow dark. Torches twinkled here and there. Those\nthey met seemed awestruck, and stood aside hastily to let Jim pass. The\nwailing of women came from above. The courtyard was full of armed Bugis\nwith their followers, and of Patusan people.\n\n'I do not know what this gathering really meant. Were these preparations\nfor war, or for vengeance, or to repulse a threatened invasion? Many\ndays elapsed before the people had ceased to look out, quaking, for\nthe return of the white men with long beards and in rags, whose exact\nrelation to their own white man they could never understand. Even for\nthose simple minds poor Jim remains under a cloud.\n\n'Doramin, alone! immense and desolate, sat in his arm-chair with the\npair of flintlock pistols on his knees, faced by a armed throng. When\nJim appeared, at somebody's exclamation, all the heads turned round\ntogether, and then the mass opened right and left, and he walked up a\nlane of averted glances. Whispers followed him; murmurs: \"He has worked\nall the evil.\" \"He hath a charm.\" . . . He heard them--perhaps!\n\n'When he came up into the light of torches the wailing of the women\nceased suddenly. Doramin did not lift his head, and Jim stood silent\nbefore him for a time. Then he looked to the left, and moved in that\ndirection with measured steps. Dain Waris's mother crouched at the head\nof the body, and the grey dishevelled hair concealed her face. Jim came\nup slowly, looked at his dead friend, lifting the sheet, than dropped it\nwithout a word. Slowly he walked back.\n\n'\"He came! He came!\" was running from lip to lip, making a murmur to\nwhich he moved. \"He hath taken it upon his own head,\" a voice said\naloud. He heard this and turned to the crowd. \"Yes. Upon my head.\" A few\npeople recoiled. Jim waited awhile before Doramin, and then said gently,\n\"I am come in sorrow.\" He waited again. \"I am come ready and unarmed,\"\nhe repeated.\n\n'The unwieldy old man, lowering his big forehead like an ox under a\nyoke, made an effort to rise, clutching at the flintlock pistols on his\nknees. From his throat came gurgling, choking, inhuman sounds, and his\ntwo attendants helped him from behind. People remarked that the ring\nwhich he had dropped on his lap fell and rolled against the foot of\nthe white man, and that poor Jim glanced down at the talisman that had\nopened for him the door of fame, love, and success within the wall of\nforests fringed with white foam, within the coast that under the western\nsun looks like the very stronghold of the night. Doramin, struggling to\nkeep his feet, made with his two supporters a swaying, tottering group;\nhis little eyes stared with an expression of mad pain, of rage, with\na ferocious glitter, which the bystanders noticed; and then, while Jim\nstood stiffened and with bared head in the light of torches, looking him\nstraight in the face, he clung heavily with his left arm round the neck\nof a bowed youth, and lifting deliberately his right, shot his son's\nfriend through the chest.\n\n'The crowd, which had fallen apart behind Jim as soon as Doramin had\nraised his hand, rushed tumultuously forward after the shot. They say\nthat the white man sent right and left at all those faces a proud and\nunflinching glance. Then with his hand over his lips he fell forward,\ndead.\n\n'And that's the end. He passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart,\nforgotten, unforgiven, and excessively romantic. Not in the wildest days\nof his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring shape of such an\nextraordinary success! For it may very well be that in the short moment\nof his last proud and unflinching glance, he had beheld the face of that\nopportunity which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side.\n\n'But we can see him, an obscure conqueror of fame, tearing himself out\nof the arms of a jealous love at the sign, at the call of his exalted\negoism. He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless\nwedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct. Is he satisfied--quite, now, I\nwonder? We ought to know. He is one of us--and have I not stood up once,\nlike an evoked ghost, to answer for his eternal constancy? Was I so very\nwrong after all? Now he is no more, there are days when the reality of\nhis existence comes to me with an immense, with an overwhelming force;\nand yet upon my honour there are moments, too when he passes from my\neyes like a disembodied spirit astray amongst the passions of this\nearth, ready to surrender himself faithfully to the claim of his own\nworld of shades.\n\n'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and the poor girl is\nleading a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has\naged greatly of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is\n\"preparing to leave all this; preparing to leave . . .\" while he waves\nhis hand sadly at his butterflies.'","chapter_length":4522.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 44-45","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20201219145744\/https:\/\/www.cliffsnotes.com\/literature\/l\/lord-jim\/summary-and-analysis\/chapters-4445","summary_text":"Brown ordered his men to load on board, telling them that he would give them \"a chance to get even with before we're done.\" He was answered by low growls. Meanwhile, Tamb' ltam reached Dain Waris' camp and was immediately taken to Dain Waris, who was resting on a raised couch made of bamboo. Tamb' Itam handed him the silver ring from Lord Jim. Brown and the white men, he said, \"were to be allowed to pass down the river.\" Dain Waris listened attentively, then slipped on Jim's ring and gave orders to prepare breakfast and make ready for the return in the afternoon. Then he lay back down and watched the sun eat up the mist and the fog. It was then that Brown took his revenge. It was, says Marlow, an act of cold-blooded ferocity,\" and it seemed all the worse later. Brown used the memory of it to \"console\" himself as he lay on his deathbed. Brown landed his men on the other side of the island opposite Dain Waris' camp and Cornelius led the way to the Bugis' camp. The Bugis were in plain sight. No one guessed that the white men knew about the narrow channel behind the camp. At the precise moment, Brown yelled out, \"Let them have it,\" and fourteen shots rang out. For a moment, not a soul moved. Then blind panic drove them wildly to and fro on the shore like a herd of frightened cattle. Three times Brown's men fired into the Bugis' camp. Tamb' Itam dropped immediately and lay as if he were dead. He told Marlow that after the first volley of shots, Dain Waris raised up from his couch and received a bullet in his forehead. In a few minutes, the white men vanished. A month later, three parched, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons, one of whom said his name was Brown, were picked up in the Indian Ocean. Brown, of course, lived and was interviewed by Marlow. Tamb' ltam told Marlow that Brown did not take Cornelius with him. Cornelius was seen running among the Bugis corpses, uttering little confused cries. Tamb' Itam caught him and stabbed him twice. Then Cornelius \"screeched like a frightened hen,\" Tamb' Itam says, and so he shoved his spear through him and \"life went out of his eyes.\" Immediately thereafter, Tamb' Itam left for the fort to report to the Bugis what had happened to Dain Waris and his men. The town of Patusan had a festive air. The women were crowded together in throngs, waiting for the return of Dain Waris and his men. The city gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam was panting and trembling when he finally reached the town. He saw Jewel, and he mumbled half-coherently to her what had happened during Brown's ambush. Then he ran to Jim's house. Jim was sleeping, but when he saw the confused state that Tamb' Itam was in, he wanted the truth: was Dain Waris dead? When he learned the tragic news, he immediately gave orders for Tamb' ltam to assemble boats, but Jim's bodyguard told him that after Dain Waris was killed, it was no longer safe for Jim's \"servant to go out amongst the people.\" Jim understood. His world had fallen in ruins. Everything was lost -- particularly the confidence that the Bugis had once placed in Jim. Loneliness closed in on Jim. The people had trusted him with their lives, and he had failed them. There was much weeping among the people, but there was more anger within them. The sun was sinking above the forest when Dain Waris' body was brought into Doramin's compound. The body was laid under a tree, and all of the women began to wail, mourning in shrill cries and screaming in high, singsong lamentations. Both Tamb' Itam and Jewel urged Jim either to make a stand or to try to escape, but Jim refused. \"I have no life,\" Jim told Tamb' Itam and Jewel. The girl begged Jim to fight, but Jim could not. \"Forgive me,\" he told Jewel, but she could not. \"Never, never!\" she screamed after him. Neither she nor Tamb' Itam could understand Jim's code of honor. Jim went to old Doramin and told him that he had come \"in sorrow . . . ready and unarmed.\" Doramin struggled to his feet, helped up by his attendants, and as he rose, the silver ring that he had taken off Dain Waris' finger slipped off his lap and rolled forward toward Jim's feet. Here was \"the talisman that had opened for him the door of fame, love, and success.\" Jim looked up and saw that Doramin was aiming a pistol directly at his chest. He looked at the old nakhoda with \"proud and unflinching\" eyes. Doramin fired, and Jim fell forward. \"And that's the end,\" writes Marlow. Even today, Jim remains a mystery to the girl and to Tamb' Itam. But, to Marlow, Jim is not a total mystery. It is true, Marlow says, that Jim passed away \"under a cloud, inscrutable . . . and excessively romantic,\" for not even in his boyhood days could Jim have dreamed such a romantic destiny for himself -- and yet that is exactly what he wanted most in life. But ultimately, Marlow said, Jim was not so different. He was, still, even at the end, \"one of us.\"","summary_analysis":"These last two chapters are filled with more action per se than any of the other chapters. We see the attack, the panic caused among the Bugis, the death of Dain Waris, Tamb' Itam's killing of Cornelius and then his quick flight back to Lord Jim, and after Jim's confrontation with Jewel, concerning whether or not to fight, we see Lord Jim go to meet Doramin with the full knowledge of his impending death. These final chapters show the penultimate treachery of \"Gentleman Brown\" -- his \"act of cold-blooded ferocity.\" What happened, Marlow says, was a lesson -- \"a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our nature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we like to think.\" Marlow seems to be implying that just as all men are capable of \"Jumping\" , likewise, all men are also capable of some sort of treachery, as performed by Brown. Certainly, Brown himself implied the same theory to Lord Jim, an idea so unnerving that it caused Jim to fail to see Brown's treachery clearly. However, Brown exceeds all decency when he gloats on his deathbed about the havoc that he wreaked upon Lord Jim. In his last moments on earth, Brown rejoiced that Lord Jim was ultimately killed. When Lord Jim climbs up to Doramin's village to face certain death, he climbs back all of the way that he had \"jumped\" when he deserted the Patna. Jim has conquered fear and shame. He has discovered the chance he waited for, the opportunity to restore to himself his own vision of himself. Jewel can never understand Jim's decision not to fight and as we have seen earlier at Stein's, she will never forgive Jim because she fully believes that he, like all white men, has deliberately deserted her. Her last words to him as he walks toward Doramin are: \"You are false!\" She screams these words to Jim, who asks her forgiveness. \"Never! Never!\" she calls back. Unfortunately, Jewel will never understand Lord Jim's moral position. He had no choice. Morally, Jim had to prove his worth to himself; fighting had nothing to do with the honor which he had to try and find within himself. Jim promised safety for his people if they would let Brown go, and he offered his life as proof that they could trust Brown. Now Dain Waris and many others are dead. Jim had to offer his own life in payment. He was a Lord to his people, and he had to give his life when it was necessary. This time, Jim did not flee, and he did not jump. He had conquered fear and shame, and he met death as a hero would. He made a bargain with the human community, a community he once deserted, and he paid for its trust with his life. At last, Jim became the master of his own destiny.","summary_length":896.0,"analysis_length":488.0,"chap_int":45,"previous summary id":["chapter 44","chapter 44"],"previous chapter":["Before dawn, Brown and his group head downriver.

Brown and the white men, he said, \"were to be allowed to pass down the river.\" Dain Waris listened attentively, then slipped on Jim's ring and gave orders to prepare breakfast and make ready for the return in the afternoon. Then he lay back down and watched the sun eat up the mist and the fog. It was then that Brown took his revenge. It was, says Marlow, an act of cold-blooded ferocity,\" and it seemed all the worse later. Brown used the memory of it to \"console\" himself as he lay on his deathbed. Brown landed his men on the other side of the island opposite Dain Waris' camp and Cornelius led the way to the Bugis' camp. The Bugis were in plain sight. No one guessed that the white men knew about the narrow channel behind the camp. At the precise moment, Brown yelled out, \"Let them have it,\" and fourteen shots rang out. For a moment, not a soul moved. Then blind panic drove them wildly to and fro on the shore like a herd of frightened cattle. Three times Brown's men fired into the Bugis' camp. Tamb' Itam dropped immediately and lay as if he were dead. He told Marlow that after the first volley of shots, Dain Waris raised up from his couch and received a bullet in his forehead. In a few minutes, the white men vanished. A month later, three parched, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons, one of whom said his name was Brown, were picked up in the Indian Ocean. Brown, of course, lived and was interviewed by Marlow. Tamb' ltam told Marlow that Brown did not take Cornelius with him. Cornelius was seen running among the Bugis corpses, uttering little confused cries. Tamb' Itam caught him and stabbed him twice. Then Cornelius \"screeched like a frightened hen,\" Tamb' Itam says, and so he shoved his spear through him and \"life went out of his eyes.\" Immediately thereafter, Tamb' Itam left for the fort to report to the Bugis what had happened to Dain Waris and his men.

Preparations are made. Jewel begs an exhausted Jim not to take active command. He tells her that every life in Patusan is his responsibility now, since the people have placed their trust in his opinion. Tamb'Itam is sent downriver to notify Dain Waris that Brown is to be allowed to pass. He takes with him Stein's silver ring as a token of his identity. Jim sends Cornelius to Brown with a note informing him that he will be allowed to go. Cornelius delivers the note, then tells Brown that an armed party headed by Dain Waris, the very man who ambushed Brown initially, waits downstream. Cornelius also tells Brown that there is an alternate river channel that will take him directly behind Dain Waris's camp, and that he, Cornelius, can guide Brown's men down it. Two hours before dawn, in a thick fog, Brown and his men head down the river. Jim calls out that he will try to send them some food. Unbeknownst to those ashore, Cornelius accompanies Brown. When they reach the alternate channel, Cornelius takes over the navigation. Meanwhile, Tamb'Itam reaches Dain Waris's camp with news of the truce. He gives Dain Waris the silver ring, which Dain Waris slips on his finger. A moment later, Gentleman Brown lands his boat behind the camp to take his revenge \\\"upon the world.\\\" He and his men open fire. Many fall dead, including Dain Waris, who takes a bullet in the forehead. Brown and his men leave as quickly as they came. Tamb'Itam, who has not been hurt, rushes to his canoe to get the news to Doramin and Jim. At the water's edge, he finds Cornelius struggling to launch a boat and escape. Tamb'Itam strikes him twice, killing him. Marlow digresses for a moment to report that a ship's boat was picked up a month after the massacre in the middle of the Indian Ocean. On board were Brown and two of his men, who claimed that they had been transporting a cargo of sugar when their ship sprung a leak and sunk. The two men died aboard the rescue vehicle; Brown has survived to tell Marlow this story. Returning to the main narrative, Marlow recounts Tamb'Itam's arrival back in Patusan. He finds Jewel, who immediately fears Doramin's wrath for the death of his son. Next he carries the news to Jim, who prepares to go fight. Tamb'Itam reluctantly informs him that he is no longer safe among the people of Patusan. This realization hits Jim hard. Tamb'Itam and Jewel urge Jim to fight for his life. Jim seems not to hear them and orders that the gates of his compound be opened and his men dismissed. Dain Waris's body is brought to Doramin's courtyard. Stein's silver ring is found on his finger. Doramin lets out a bellow and the crowd begins to murmur, realizing that the ring could only have come from Jim. Jim prepares to leave his house. Jewel reminds him of his promise not to leave her, and he tells her that he would no longer be worth having if he didn't leave. He departs for Doramin's. Tamb'Itam recalls the frightful aspect of the sky, and Marlow notes that a cyclone passed near Patusan on that very day. Jim arrives at Doramin's. Approaching the old man, he declares himself sorrowful and unarmed. Doramin stands, sending the silver ring rolling toward Jim. Doramin shoots Jim through the heart, and Jim falls dead. Marlow ends the narrative reiterating the dark, romantic nature of Jim's life and his \\\"extraordinary success.\\\" Yet, for Marlow, Jim remains \\\"inscrutable at heart,\\\" and the meaning of the narrative is still in question.\", \"analysis\": \"Commentary It is Marlow, not Jim, who has the last word on Jim's life, noting simply that \\\"e is gone, inscrutable at heart. \\\" The word \\\"heart\\\" has been associated with Jim over and over again. He is described both as having a core, or \\\"heart,\\\" that is in some way unknowable or confusing, and also as being at the \\\"heart\\\" of some vast puzzle. The doubled use of this word points back to some of the earlier incidents of confusion over language  and the failure of language to have a definitive meaning. Jim's life has no definitive meaning either. The two \\\"hearts\\\" associated with Jim are also suggestive of one of the fundamental problems of the novel: is Jim in fact representative of something larger than himself? Is there an \\\"us\\\" that he is \\\"one of\\\"? Whether he is at the heart of the inscrutable or merely inscrutable at heart is the fundamental question Marlow must answer. By deferring to Stein, and speaking of Stein's approaching end, and by finishing the narrative in a manuscript rather than in another session of storytelling, Marlow avoids the question. Perhaps it is a question that cannot be answered at all; as Marlow notes, some days Jim seems very real to him, some days Jim seems not to have existed at all. As Marlow notes, Jim has \\\" away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless wedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct.\\\" Marlow thus assigns Jim's story to the realm of romance. The ending of Lord Jim suggests more of a fatal collision between romance and realism than any sort of viable, pure romance, though. Jim's choice of the \\\"shadowy ideal of conduct\\\" has led to the deaths of Dain Waris and other men, and to the destruction of Jewel's world. Had Jim not dwelt so fixedly on his failure in the Patna incident, he would have ordered the deaths of Brown and his men, and all would have been well in Patusan. On the other hand, had Jim not dwelt so fixedly on the Patna, he would never have come to Patusan, and arguably not only he but also the people of Patusan are better off for his presence. Idealism and notions of heroism lead to nothing but paradox and sadness. This novel has more in common with Hemingway's tales of damaged and disillusioned men or T.S. Eliot's narratives of the forlorn and impotent than it does with earlier works in which moral upstandingness leads to death with honor, if not a happy ending complete with riches and beautiful women. That this section contains more of the trappings of traditional swashbuckling romance  is meant to highlight the contrast. The ending is a mixed one: Jim dies, with a curious mixture of honor and shame, in a manner at least somewhat similar to an old-fashioned hero, while Marlow, like one of Hemingway's protagonists, is left alive, sadder but not necessarily wiser. This is also a section heavier in symbolism than most. The fog which envelops Brown and his men as they head downriver contrasts with the extreme clarity with which Marlow last sees Jim, on the beach with the fishermen. It is also indicative of the amorphous morality of both Brown's and Jim's actions. Brown, after all, thinks he has been double-crossed, based on the information Cornelius has given him. Jim, as we have already seen, is caught in a bind. The night of the Patna's accident was crystal-clear and still; nothing should have obscured Jim's decision-making then. Because he failed then, yet has held on to his ideals, situations no longer have clear solutions. Brown, too, although he seems to be acting logically, is also punished, by being shipwrecked soon afterward and dying a long, drawn-out death. Weather, though, is the primary vehicle for symbolic content. When the fog clears off, Tamb'Itam reports, the sky is in turmoil. Marlow attributes this to a cyclone passing nearby. This is another moment when romance and realism are at odds. In a romantic world, the cyclone would have descended upon Patusan at the moment of Jim's death, symbolizing the disorder in the world that led to the destruction of our hero. In a realistic world, weather would be ordinary and meaningless. The cyclone's close approach suggests a failure of both models; somehow, Jim's death must be given import, yet the issues surrounding it are too muddled and romance too outmoded for the full symbolic performance to occur. This cyclone should be contrasted to the squall that hits the Patna, as well as to the rumored hurricane that wipes out Chester and Robinson's guano-collecting expedition to the Walpole Reef. Here, finally, the storm--the symbol of higher powers or order--fails to impose its meaning.\"}","chapter":"'Tamb' Itam behind his chair was thunderstruck. The declaration produced\nan immense sensation. \"Let them go because this is best in my knowledge\nwhich has never deceived you,\" Jim insisted. There was a silence. In\nthe darkness of the courtyard could be heard the subdued whispering,\nshuffling noise of many people. Doramin raised his heavy head and said\nthat there was no more reading of hearts than touching the sky with the\nhand, but--he consented. The others gave their opinion in turn. \"It is\nbest,\" \"Let them go,\" and so on. But most of them simply said that they\n\"believed Tuan Jim.\"\n\n'In this simple form of assent to his will lies the whole gist of\nthe situation; their creed, his truth; and the testimony to that\nfaithfulness which made him in his own eyes the equal of the\nimpeccable men who never fall out of the ranks. Stein's words,\n\"Romantic!--Romantic!\" seem to ring over those distances that will never\ngive him up now to a world indifferent to his failings and his virtues,\nand to that ardent and clinging affection that refuses him the dole of\ntears in the bewilderment of a great grief and of eternal separation.\nFrom the moment the sheer truthfulness of his last three years of life\ncarries the day against the ignorance, the fear, and the anger of men,\nhe appears no longer to me as I saw him last--a white speck catching all\nthe dim light left upon a sombre coast and the darkened sea--but greater\nand more pitiful in the loneliness of his soul, that remains even for\nher who loved him best a cruel and insoluble mystery.\n\n'It is evident that he did not mistrust Brown; there was no reason to\ndoubt the story, whose truth seemed warranted by the rough frankness,\nby a sort of virile sincerity in accepting the morality and the\nconsequences of his acts. But Jim did not know the almost inconceivable\negotism of the man which made him, when resisted and foiled in his will,\nmad with the indignant and revengeful rage of a thwarted autocrat.\nBut if Jim did not mistrust Brown, he was evidently anxious that some\nmisunderstanding should not occur, ending perhaps in collision and\nbloodshed. It was for this reason that directly the Malay chiefs had\ngone he asked Jewel to get him something to eat, as he was going out of\nthe fort to take command in the town. On her remonstrating against this\non the score of his fatigue, he said that something might happen for\nwhich he would never forgive himself. \"I am responsible for every life\nin the land,\" he said. He was moody at first; she served him with her\nown hands, taking the plates and dishes (of the dinner-service presented\nhim by Stein) from Tamb' Itam. He brightened up after a while; told her\nshe would be again in command of the fort for another night. \"There's\nno sleep for us, old girl,\" he said, \"while our people are in danger.\"\nLater on he said jokingly that she was the best man of them all. \"If you\nand Dain Waris had done what you wanted, not one of these poor devils\nwould be alive to-day.\" \"Are they very bad?\" she asked, leaning over his\nchair. \"Men act badly sometimes without being much worse than others,\"\nhe said after some hesitation.\n\n'Tamb' Itam followed his master to the landing-stage outside the fort.\nThe night was clear but without a moon, and the middle of the river was\ndark, while the water under each bank reflected the light of many fires\n\"as on a night of Ramadan,\" Tamb' Itam said. War-boats drifted silently\nin the dark lane or, anchored, floated motionless with a loud ripple.\nThat night there was much paddling in a canoe and walking at his\nmaster's heels for Tamb' Itam: up and down the street they tramped,\nwhere the fires were burning, inland on the outskirts of the town where\nsmall parties of men kept guard in the fields. Tuan Jim gave his orders\nand was obeyed. Last of all they went to the Rajah's stockade, which a\ndetachment of Jim's people manned on that night. The old Rajah had fled\nearly in the morning with most of his women to a small house he had\nnear a jungle village on a tributary stream. Kassim, left behind, had\nattended the council with his air of diligent activity to explain away\nthe diplomacy of the day before. He was considerably cold-shouldered,\nbut managed to preserve his smiling, quiet alertness, and professed\nhimself highly delighted when Jim told him sternly that he proposed to\noccupy the stockade on that night with his own men. After the council\nbroke up he was heard outside accosting this and that deputing chief,\nand speaking in a loud, gratified tone of the Rajah's property being\nprotected in the Rajah's absence.\n\n'About ten or so Jim's men marched in. The stockade commanded the mouth\nof the creek, and Jim meant to remain there till Brown had passed below.\nA small fire was lit on the flat, grassy point outside the wall of\nstakes, and Tamb' Itam placed a little folding-stool for his master. Jim\ntold him to try and sleep. Tamb' Itam got a mat and lay down a little\nway off; but he could not sleep, though he knew he had to go on an\nimportant journey before the night was out. His master walked to and fro\nbefore the fire with bowed head and with his hands behind his back. His\nface was sad. Whenever his master approached him Tamb' Itam pretended to\nsleep, not wishing his master to know he had been watched. At last his\nmaster stood still, looking down on him as he lay, and said softly, \"It\nis time.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam arose directly and made his preparations. His mission was\nto go down the river, preceding Brown's boat by an hour or more, to tell\nDain Waris finally and formally that the whites were to be allowed to\npass out unmolested. Jim would not trust anybody else with that service.\nBefore starting, Tamb' Itam, more as a matter of form (since his\nposition about Jim made him perfectly known), asked for a token.\n\"Because, Tuan,\" he said, \"the message is important, and these are thy\nvery words I carry.\" His master first put his hand into one pocket, then\ninto another, and finally took off his forefinger Stein's silver ring,\nwhich he habitually wore, and gave it to Tamb' Itam. When Tamb' Itam\nleft on his mission, Brown's camp on the knoll was dark but for a single\nsmall glow shining through the branches of one of the trees the white\nmen had cut down.\n\n'Early in the evening Brown had received from Jim a folded piece of\npaper on which was written, \"You get the clear road. Start as soon\nas your boat floats on the morning tide. Let your men be careful. The\nbushes on both sides of the creek and the stockade at the mouth are full\nof well-armed men. You would have no chance, but I don't believe you\nwant bloodshed.\" Brown read it, tore the paper into small pieces, and,\nturning to Cornelius, who had brought it, said jeeringly, \"Good-bye, my\nexcellent friend.\" Cornelius had been in the fort, and had been sneaking\naround Jim's house during the afternoon. Jim chose him to carry the note\nbecause he could speak English, was known to Brown, and was not likely\nto be shot by some nervous mistake of one of the men as a Malay,\napproaching in the dusk, perhaps might have been.\n\n'Cornelius didn't go away after delivering the paper. Brown was sitting\nup over a tiny fire; all the others were lying down. \"I could tell you\nsomething you would like to know,\" Cornelius mumbled crossly. Brown paid\nno attention. \"You did not kill him,\" went on the other, \"and what do\nyou get for it? You might have had money from the Rajah, besides the\nloot of all the Bugis houses, and now you get nothing.\" \"You had better\nclear out from here,\" growled Brown, without even looking at him. But\nCornelius let himself drop by his side and began to whisper very fast,\ntouching his elbow from time to time. What he had to say made Brown sit\nup at first, with a curse. He had simply informed him of Dain Waris's\narmed party down the river. At first Brown saw himself completely sold\nand betrayed, but a moment's reflection convinced him that there could\nbe no treachery intended. He said nothing, and after a while Cornelius\nremarked, in a tone of complete indifference, that there was another way\nout of the river which he knew very well. \"A good thing to know, too,\"\nsaid Brown, pricking up his ears; and Cornelius began to talk of\nwhat went on in town and repeated all that had been said in council,\ngossiping in an even undertone at Brown's ear as you talk amongst\nsleeping men you do not wish to wake. \"He thinks he has made me\nharmless, does he?\" mumbled Brown very low. . . . \"Yes. He is a fool. A\nlittle child. He came here and robbed me,\" droned on Cornelius, \"and he\nmade all the people believe him. But if something happened that they did\nnot believe him any more, where would he be? And the Bugis Dain who\nis waiting for you down the river there, captain, is the very man who\nchased you up here when you first came.\" Brown observed nonchalantly\nthat it would be just as well to avoid him, and with the same detached,\nmusing air Cornelius declared himself acquainted with a backwater broad\nenough to take Brown's boat past Waris's camp. \"You will have to be\nquiet,\" he said as an afterthought, \"for in one place we pass close\nbehind his camp. Very close. They are camped ashore with their boats\nhauled up.\" \"Oh, we know how to be as quiet as mice; never fear,\" said\nBrown. Cornelius stipulated that in case he were to pilot Brown out, his\ncanoe should be towed. \"I'll have to get back quick,\" he explained.\n\n'It was two hours before the dawn when word was passed to the stockade\nfrom outlying watchers that the white robbers were coming down to their\nboat. In a very short time every armed man from one end of Patusan\nto the other was on the alert, yet the banks of the river remained so\nsilent that but for the fires burning with sudden blurred flares the\ntown might have been asleep as if in peace-time. A heavy mist lay very\nlow on the water, making a sort of illusive grey light that showed\nnothing. When Brown's long-boat glided out of the creek into the\nriver, Jim was standing on the low point of land before the Rajah's\nstockade--on the very spot where for the first time he put his foot on\nPatusan shore. A shadow loomed up, moving in the greyness, solitary,\nvery bulky, and yet constantly eluding the eye. A murmur of low talking\ncame out of it. Brown at the tiller heard Jim speak calmly: \"A clear\nroad. You had better trust to the current while the fog lasts; but\nthis will lift presently.\" \"Yes, presently we shall see clear,\" replied\nBrown.\n\n'The thirty or forty men standing with muskets at ready outside the\nstockade held their breath. The Bugis owner of the prau, whom I saw\non Stein's verandah, and who was amongst them, told me that the boat,\nshaving the low point close, seemed for a moment to grow big and hang\nover it like a mountain. \"If you think it worth your while to wait a\nday outside,\" called out Jim, \"I'll try to send you down something--a\nbullock, some yams--what I can.\" The shadow went on moving. \"Yes. Do,\"\nsaid a voice, blank and muffled out of the fog. Not one of the many\nattentive listeners understood what the words meant; and then Brown\nand his men in their boat floated away, fading spectrally without the\nslightest sound.\n\n'Thus Brown, invisible in the mist, goes out of Patusan elbow to elbow\nwith Cornelius in the stern-sheets of the long-boat. \"Perhaps you shall\nget a small bullock,\" said Cornelius. \"Oh yes. Bullock. Yam. You'll get\nit if he said so. He always speaks the truth. He stole everything I had.\nI suppose you like a small bullock better than the loot of many houses.\"\n\"I would advise you to hold your tongue, or somebody here may fling\nyou overboard into this damned fog,\" said Brown. The boat seemed to be\nstanding still; nothing could be seen, not even the river alongside,\nonly the water-dust flew and trickled, condensed, down their beards and\nfaces. It was weird, Brown told me. Every individual man of them felt\nas though he were adrift alone in a boat, haunted by an almost\nimperceptible suspicion of sighing, muttering ghosts. \"Throw me out,\nwould you? But I would know where I was,\" mumbled Cornelius surlily.\n\"I've lived many years here.\" \"Not long enough to see through a fog like\nthis,\" Brown said, lolling back with his arm swinging to and fro on the\nuseless tiller. \"Yes. Long enough for that,\" snarled Cornelius. \"That's\nvery useful,\" commented Brown. \"Am I to believe you could find that\nbackway you spoke of blindfold, like this?\" Cornelius grunted. \"Are you\ntoo tired to row?\" he asked after a silence. \"No, by God!\" shouted Brown\nsuddenly. \"Out with your oars there.\" There was a great knocking in\nthe fog, which after a while settled into a regular grind of invisible\nsweeps against invisible thole-pins. Otherwise nothing was changed, and\nbut for the slight splash of a dipped blade it was like rowing a balloon\ncar in a cloud, said Brown. Thereafter Cornelius did not open his lips\nexcept to ask querulously for somebody to bale out his canoe, which\nwas towing behind the long-boat. Gradually the fog whitened and became\nluminous ahead. To the left Brown saw a darkness as though he had been\nlooking at the back of the departing night. All at once a big bough\ncovered with leaves appeared above his head, and ends of twigs, dripping\nand still, curved slenderly close alongside. Cornelius, without a word,\ntook the tiller from his hand.'\n\n'I don't think they spoke together again. The boat entered a narrow\nby-channel, where it was pushed by the oar-blades set into crumbling\nbanks, and there was a gloom as if enormous black wings had been\noutspread above the mist that filled its depth to the summits of the\ntrees. The branches overhead showered big drops through the gloomy fog.\nAt a mutter from Cornelius, Brown ordered his men to load. \"I'll\ngive you a chance to get even with them before we're done, you dismal\ncripples, you,\" he said to his gang. \"Mind you don't throw it away--you\nhounds.\" Low growls answered that speech. Cornelius showed much fussy\nconcern for the safety of his canoe.\n\n'Meantime Tamb' Itam had reached the end of his journey. The fog had\ndelayed him a little, but he had paddled steadily, keeping in touch with\nthe south bank. By-and-by daylight came like a glow in a ground glass\nglobe. The shores made on each side of the river a dark smudge, in which\none could detect hints of columnar forms and shadows of twisted branches\nhigh up. The mist was still thick on the water, but a good watch was\nbeing kept, for as Iamb' Itam approached the camp the figures of two men\nemerged out of the white vapour, and voices spoke to him boisterously.\nHe answered, and presently a canoe lay alongside, and he exchanged news\nwith the paddlers. All was well. The trouble was over. Then the men in\nthe canoe let go their grip on the side of his dug-out and incontinently\nfell out of sight. He pursued his way till he heard voices coming to him\nquietly over the water, and saw, under the now lifting, swirling mist,\nthe glow of many little fires burning on a sandy stretch, backed by\nlofty thin timber and bushes. There again a look-out was kept, for he\nwas challenged. He shouted his name as the two last sweeps of his paddle\nran his canoe up on the strand. It was a big camp. Men crouched in many\nlittle knots under a subdued murmur of early morning talk. Many thin\nthreads of smoke curled slowly on the white mist. Little shelters,\nelevated above the ground, had been built for the chiefs. Muskets were\nstacked in small pyramids, and long spears were stuck singly into the\nsand near the fires.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, assuming an air of importance, demanded to be led to Dain\nWaris. He found the friend of his white lord lying on a raised couch\nmade of bamboo, and sheltered by a sort of shed of sticks covered with\nmats. Dain Waris was awake, and a bright fire was burning before his\nsleeping-place, which resembled a rude shrine. The only son of nakhoda\nDoramin answered his greeting kindly. Tamb' Itam began by handing him\nthe ring which vouched for the truth of the messenger's words. Dain\nWaris, reclining on his elbow, bade him speak and tell all the news.\nBeginning with the consecrated formula, \"The news is good,\" Tamb' Itam\ndelivered Jim's own words. The white men, deputing with the consent of\nall the chiefs, were to be allowed to pass down the river. In answer to\na question or two Tamb' Itam then reported the proceedings of the last\ncouncil. Dain Waris listened attentively to the end, toying with the\nring which ultimately he slipped on the forefinger of his right hand.\nAfter hearing all he had to say he dismissed Tamb' Itam to have food\nand rest. Orders for the return in the afternoon were given immediately.\nAfterwards Dain Waris lay down again, open-eyed, while his personal\nattendants were preparing his food at the fire, by which Tamb' Itam also\nsat talking to the men who lounged up to hear the latest intelligence\nfrom the town. The sun was eating up the mist. A good watch was kept\nupon the reach of the main stream where the boat of the whites was\nexpected to appear every moment.\n\n'It was then that Brown took his revenge upon the world which, after\ntwenty years of contemptuous and reckless bullying, refused him the\ntribute of a common robber's success. It was an act of cold-blooded\nferocity, and it consoled him on his deathbed like a memory of an\nindomitable defiance. Stealthily he landed his men on the other side\nof the island opposite to the Bugis camp, and led them across. After a\nshort but quite silent scuffle, Cornelius, who had tried to slink away\nat the moment of landing, resigned himself to show the way where the\nundergrowth was most sparse. Brown held both his skinny hands together\nbehind his back in the grip of one vast fist, and now and then impelled\nhim forward with a fierce push. Cornelius remained as mute as a fish,\nabject but faithful to his purpose, whose accomplishment loomed before\nhim dimly. At the edge of the patch of forest Brown's men spread\nthemselves out in cover and waited. The camp was plain from end to end\nbefore their eyes, and no one looked their way. Nobody even dreamed that\nthe white men could have any knowledge of the narrow channel at the back\nof the island. When he judged the moment come, Brown yelled, \"Let them\nhave it,\" and fourteen shots rang out like one.\n\n'Tamb' Itam told me the surprise was so great that, except for those who\nfell dead or wounded, not a soul of them moved for quite an appreciable\ntime after the first discharge. Then a man screamed, and after that\nscream a great yell of amazement and fear went up from all the throats.\nA blind panic drove these men in a surging swaying mob to and fro along\nthe shore like a herd of cattle afraid of the water. Some few jumped\ninto the river then, but most of them did so only after the last\ndischarge. Three times Brown's men fired into the ruck, Brown, the only\none in view, cursing and yelling, \"Aim low! aim low!\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam says that, as for him, he understood at the first volley\nwhat had happened. Though untouched he fell down and lay as if dead,\nbut with his eyes open. At the sound of the first shots Dain Waris,\nreclining on the couch, jumped up and ran out upon the open shore, just\nin time to receive a bullet in his forehead at the second discharge.\nTamb' Itam saw him fling his arms wide open before he fell. Then, he\nsays, a great fear came upon him--not before. The white men retired as\nthey had come--unseen.\n\n'Thus Brown balanced his account with the evil fortune. Notice that even\nin this awful outbreak there is a superiority as of a man who carries\nright--the abstract thing--within the envelope of his common desires.\nIt was not a vulgar and treacherous massacre; it was a lesson, a\nretribution--a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our\nnature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we\nlike to think.\n\n'Afterwards the whites depart unseen by Tamb' Itam, and seem to vanish\nfrom before men's eyes altogether; and the schooner, too, vanishes after\nthe manner of stolen goods. But a story is told of a white long-boat\npicked up a month later in the Indian Ocean by a cargo steamer. Two\nparched, yellow, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons in her recognised\nthe authority of a third, who declared that his name was Brown. His\nschooner, he reported, bound south with a cargo of Java sugar, had\nsprung a bad leak and sank under his feet. He and his companions were\nthe survivors of a crew of six. The two died on board the steamer which\nrescued them. Brown lived to be seen by me, and I can testify that he\nhad played his part to the last.\n\n'It seems, however, that in going away they had neglected to cast off\nCornelius's canoe. Cornelius himself Brown had let go at the beginning\nof the shooting, with a kick for a parting benediction. Tamb' Itam,\nafter arising from amongst the dead, saw the Nazarene running up and\ndown the shore amongst the corpses and the expiring fires. He uttered\nlittle cries. Suddenly he rushed to the water, and made frantic efforts\nto get one of the Bugis boats into the water. \"Afterwards, till he had\nseen me,\" related Tamb' Itam, \"he stood looking at the heavy canoe and\nscratching his head.\" \"What became of him?\" I asked. Tamb' Itam, staring\nhard at me, made an expressive gesture with his right arm. \"Twice I\nstruck, Tuan,\" he said. \"When he beheld me approaching he cast himself\nviolently on the ground and made a great outcry, kicking. He screeched\nlike a frightened hen till he felt the point; then he was still, and lay\nstaring at me while his life went out of his eyes.\"\n\n'This done, Tamb' Itam did not tarry. He understood the importance of\nbeing the first with the awful news at the fort. There were, of course,\nmany survivors of Dain Waris's party; but in the extremity of panic some\nhad swum across the river, others had bolted into the bush. The fact is\nthat they did not know really who struck that blow--whether more white\nrobbers were not coming, whether they had not already got hold of\nthe whole land. They imagined themselves to be the victims of a vast\ntreachery, and utterly doomed to destruction. It is said that some small\nparties did not come in till three days afterwards. However, a few tried\nto make their way back to Patusan at once, and one of the canoes that\nwere patrolling the river that morning was in sight of the camp at\nthe very moment of the attack. It is true that at first the men in her\nleaped overboard and swam to the opposite bank, but afterwards they\nreturned to their boat and started fearfully up-stream. Of these Tamb'\nItam had an hour's advance.''When Tamb' Itam, paddling madly, came into the town-reach, the women,\nthronging the platforms before the houses, were looking out for the\nreturn of Dain Waris's little fleet of boats. The town had a festive\nair; here and there men, still with spears or guns in their hands, could\nbe seen moving or standing on the shore in groups. Chinamen's shops had\nbeen opened early; but the market-place was empty, and a sentry, still\nposted at the corner of the fort, made out Tamb' Itam, and shouted to\nthose within. The gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam jumped ashore and ran\nin headlong. The first person he met was the girl coming down from the\nhouse.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, disordered, panting, with trembling lips and wild eyes,\nstood for a time before her as if a sudden spell had been laid on him.\nThen he broke out very quickly: \"They have killed Dain Waris and many\nmore.\" She clapped her hands, and her first words were, \"Shut the\ngates.\" Most of the fortmen had gone back to their houses, but Tamb'\nItam hurried on the few who remained for their turn of duty within. The\ngirl stood in the middle of the courtyard while the others ran about.\n\"Doramin,\" she cried despairingly, as Tamb' Itam passed her. Next time\nhe went by he answered her thought rapidly, \"Yes. But we have all the\npowder in Patusan.\" She caught him by the arm, and, pointing at the\nhouse, \"Call him out,\" she whispered, trembling.\n\n'Tamb' Itam ran up the steps. His master was sleeping. \"It is I, Tamb'\nItam,\" he cried at the door, \"with tidings that cannot wait.\" He saw\nJim turn over on the pillow and open his eyes, and he burst out at\nonce. \"This, Tuan, is a day of evil, an accursed day.\" His master raised\nhimself on his elbow to listen--just as Dain Waris had done. And then\nTamb' Itam began his tale, trying to relate the story in order, calling\nDain Waris Panglima, and saying: \"The Panglima then called out to the\nchief of his own boatmen, 'Give Tamb' Itam something to eat'\"--when\nhis master put his feet to the ground and looked at him with such a\ndiscomposed face that the words remained in his throat.\n\n'\"Speak out,\" said Jim. \"Is he dead?\" \"May you live long,\" cried Tamb'\nItam. \"It was a most cruel treachery. He ran out at the first shots and\nfell.\" . . . His master walked to the window and with his fist struck\nat the shutter. The room was made light; and then in a steady voice, but\nspeaking fast, he began to give him orders to assemble a fleet of boats\nfor immediate pursuit, go to this man, to the other--send messengers;\nand as he talked he sat down on the bed, stooping to lace his boots\nhurriedly, and suddenly looked up. \"Why do you stand here?\" he asked\nvery red-faced. \"Waste no time.\" Tamb' Itam did not move. \"Forgive me,\nTuan, but . . . but,\" he began to stammer. \"What?\" cried his master\naloud, looking terrible, leaning forward with his hands gripping the\nedge of the bed. \"It is not safe for thy servant to go out amongst the\npeople,\" said Tamb' Itam, after hesitating a moment.\n\n'Then Jim understood. He had retreated from one world, for a small\nmatter of an impulsive jump, and now the other, the work of his own\nhands, had fallen in ruins upon his head. It was not safe for his\nservant to go out amongst his own people! I believe that in that very\nmoment he had decided to defy the disaster in the only way it occurred\nto him such a disaster could be defied; but all I know is that, without\na word, he came out of his room and sat before the long table, at the\nhead of which he was accustomed to regulate the affairs of his world,\nproclaiming daily the truth that surely lived in his heart. The dark\npowers should not rob him twice of his peace. He sat like a stone\nfigure. Tamb' Itam, deferential, hinted at preparations for defence.\nThe girl he loved came in and spoke to him, but he made a sign with his\nhand, and she was awed by the dumb appeal for silence in it. She went\nout on the verandah and sat on the threshold, as if to guard him with\nher body from dangers outside.\n\n'What thoughts passed through his head--what memories? Who can tell?\nEverything was gone, and he who had been once unfaithful to his trust\nhad lost again all men's confidence. It was then, I believe, he tried\nto write--to somebody--and gave it up. Loneliness was closing on him.\nPeople had trusted him with their lives--only for that; and yet they\ncould never, as he had said, never be made to understand him. Those\nwithout did not hear him make a sound. Later, towards the evening, he\ncame to the door and called for Tamb' Itam. \"Well?\" he asked. \"There is\nmuch weeping. Much anger too,\" said Tamb' Itam. Jim looked up at him.\n\"You know,\" he murmured. \"Yes, Tuan,\" said Tamb' Itam. \"Thy servant does\nknow, and the gates are closed. We shall have to fight.\" \"Fight! What\nfor?\" he asked. \"For our lives.\" \"I have no life,\" he said. Tamb' Itam\nheard a cry from the girl at the door. \"Who knows?\" said Tamb' Itam.\n\"By audacity and cunning we may even escape. There is much fear in men's\nhearts too.\" He went out, thinking vaguely of boats and of open sea,\nleaving Jim and the girl together.\n\n'I haven't the heart to set down here such glimpses as she had given\nme of the hour or more she passed in there wrestling with him for the\npossession of her happiness. Whether he had any hope--what he expected,\nwhat he imagined--it is impossible to say. He was inflexible, and with\nthe growing loneliness of his obstinacy his spirit seemed to rise above\nthe ruins of his existence. She cried \"Fight!\" into his ear. She could\nnot understand. There was nothing to fight for. He was going to prove\nhis power in another way and conquer the fatal destiny itself. He came\nout into the courtyard, and behind him, with streaming hair, wild\nof face, breathless, she staggered out and leaned on the side of the\ndoorway. \"Open the gates,\" he ordered. Afterwards, turning to those of\nhis men who were inside, he gave them leave to depart to their homes.\n\"For how long, Tuan?\" asked one of them timidly. \"For all life,\" he\nsaid, in a sombre tone.\n\n'A hush had fallen upon the town after the outburst of wailing and\nlamentation that had swept over the river, like a gust of wind from the\nopened abode of sorrow. But rumours flew in whispers, filling the hearts\nwith consternation and horrible doubts. The robbers were coming back,\nbringing many others with them, in a great ship, and there would be no\nrefuge in the land for any one. A sense of utter insecurity as during\nan earthquake pervaded the minds of men, who whispered their suspicions,\nlooking at each other as if in the presence of some awful portent.\n\n'The sun was sinking towards the forests when Dain Waris's body was\nbrought into Doramin's campong. Four men carried it in, covered decently\nwith a white sheet which the old mother had sent out down to the gate to\nmeet her son on his return. They laid him at Doramin's feet, and the old\nman sat still for a long time, one hand on each knee, looking down. The\nfronds of palms swayed gently, and the foliage of fruit trees stirred\nabove his head. Every single man of his people was there, fully armed,\nwhen the old nakhoda at last raised his eyes. He moved them slowly over\nthe crowd, as if seeking for a missing face. Again his chin sank on his\nbreast. The whispers of many men mingled with the slight rustling of the\nleaves.\n\n'The Malay who had brought Tamb' Itam and the girl to Samarang was there\ntoo. \"Not so angry as many,\" he said to me, but struck with a great\nawe and wonder at the \"suddenness of men's fate, which hangs over their\nheads like a cloud charged with thunder.\" He told me that when Dain\nWaris's body was uncovered at a sign of Doramin's, he whom they often\ncalled the white lord's friend was disclosed lying unchanged with his\neyelids a little open as if about to wake. Doramin leaned forward a\nlittle more, like one looking for something fallen on the ground. His\neyes searched the body from its feet to its head, for the wound maybe.\nIt was in the forehead and small; and there was no word spoken while\none of the by-standers, stooping, took off the silver ring from the cold\nstiff hand. In silence he held it up before Doramin. A murmur of dismay\nand horror ran through the crowd at the sight of that familiar token.\nThe old nakhoda stared at it, and suddenly let out one great fierce cry,\ndeep from the chest, a roar of pain and fury, as mighty as the bellow of\na wounded bull, bringing great fear into men's hearts, by the magnitude\nof his anger and his sorrow that could be plainly discerned without\nwords. There was a great stillness afterwards for a space, while the\nbody was being borne aside by four men. They laid it down under a tree,\nand on the instant, with one long shriek, all the women of the household\nbegan to wail together; they mourned with shrill cries; the sun\nwas setting, and in the intervals of screamed lamentations the high\nsing-song voices of two old men intoning the Koran chanted alone.\n\n'About this time Jim, leaning on a gun-carriage, looked at the river,\nand turned his back on the house; and the girl, in the doorway, panting\nas if she had run herself to a standstill, was looking at him across the\nyard. Tamb' Itam stood not far from his master, waiting patiently for\nwhat might happen. All at once Jim, who seemed to be lost in quiet\nthought, turned to him and said, \"Time to finish this.\"\n\n'\"Tuan?\" said Tamb' Itam, advancing with alacrity. He did not know what\nhis master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started\ntoo and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of\nthe people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about\nhalf-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful\ncontemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against\nthe gun. \"Will you fight?\" she cried. \"There is nothing to fight for,\"\nhe said; \"nothing is lost.\" Saying this he made a step towards her.\n\"Will you fly?\" she cried again. \"There is no escape,\" he said, stopping\nshort, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes.\n\"And you shall go?\" she said slowly. He bent his head. \"Ah!\" she\nexclaimed, peering at him as it were, \"you are mad or false. Do you\nremember the night I prayed you to leave me, and you said that you could\nnot? That it was impossible! Impossible! Do you remember you said you\nwould never leave me? Why? I asked you for no promise. You promised\nunasked--remember.\" \"Enough, poor girl,\" he said. \"I should not be worth\nhaving.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam said that while they were talking she would laugh loud and\nsenselessly like one under the visitation of God. His master put his\nhands to his head. He was fully dressed as for every day, but without\na hat. She stopped laughing suddenly. \"For the last time,\" she cried\nmenacingly, \"will you defend yourself?\" \"Nothing can touch me,\" he said\nin a last flicker of superb egoism. Tamb' Itam saw her lean forward\nwhere she stood, open her arms, and run at him swiftly. She flung\nherself upon his breast and clasped him round the neck.\n\n'\"Ah! but I shall hold thee thus,\" she cried. . . . \"Thou art mine!\"\n\n'She sobbed on his shoulder. The sky over Patusan was blood-red,\nimmense, streaming like an open vein. An enormous sun nestled crimson\namongst the tree-tops, and the forest below had a black and forbidding\nface.\n\n'Tamb' Itam tells me that on that evening the aspect of the heavens was\nangry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know that on that very\nday a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was\nhardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.\n\n'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim catch her arms, trying to unclasp her\nhands. She hung on them with her head fallen back; her hair touched the\nground. \"Come here!\" his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped to ease\nher down. It was difficult to separate her fingers. Jim, bending\nover her, looked earnestly upon her face, and all at once ran to the\nlanding-stage. Tamb' Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw\nthat she had struggled up to her feet. She ran after them a few steps,\nthen fell down heavily on her knees. \"Tuan! Tuan!\" called Tamb' Itam,\n\"look back;\" but Jim was already in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand.\nHe did not look back. Tamb' Itam had just time to scramble in after\nhim when the canoe floated clear. The girl was then on her knees, with\nclasped hands, at the water-gate. She remained thus for a time in\na supplicating attitude before she sprang up. \"You are false!\" she\nscreamed out after Jim. \"Forgive me,\" he cried. \"Never! Never!\" she\ncalled back.\n\n'Tamb' Itam took the paddle from Jim's hands, it being unseemly that he\nshould sit while his lord paddled. When they reached the other shore his\nmaster forbade him to come any farther; but Tamb' Itam did follow him at\na distance, walking up the slope to Doramin's campong.\n\n'It was beginning to grow dark. Torches twinkled here and there. Those\nthey met seemed awestruck, and stood aside hastily to let Jim pass. The\nwailing of women came from above. The courtyard was full of armed Bugis\nwith their followers, and of Patusan people.\n\n'I do not know what this gathering really meant. Were these preparations\nfor war, or for vengeance, or to repulse a threatened invasion? Many\ndays elapsed before the people had ceased to look out, quaking, for\nthe return of the white men with long beards and in rags, whose exact\nrelation to their own white man they could never understand. Even for\nthose simple minds poor Jim remains under a cloud.\n\n'Doramin, alone! immense and desolate, sat in his arm-chair with the\npair of flintlock pistols on his knees, faced by a armed throng. When\nJim appeared, at somebody's exclamation, all the heads turned round\ntogether, and then the mass opened right and left, and he walked up a\nlane of averted glances. Whispers followed him; murmurs: \"He has worked\nall the evil.\" \"He hath a charm.\" . . . He heard them--perhaps!\n\n'When he came up into the light of torches the wailing of the women\nceased suddenly. Doramin did not lift his head, and Jim stood silent\nbefore him for a time. Then he looked to the left, and moved in that\ndirection with measured steps. Dain Waris's mother crouched at the head\nof the body, and the grey dishevelled hair concealed her face. Jim came\nup slowly, looked at his dead friend, lifting the sheet, than dropped it\nwithout a word. Slowly he walked back.\n\n'\"He came! He came!\" was running from lip to lip, making a murmur to\nwhich he moved. \"He hath taken it upon his own head,\" a voice said\naloud. He heard this and turned to the crowd. \"Yes. Upon my head.\" A few\npeople recoiled. Jim waited awhile before Doramin, and then said gently,\n\"I am come in sorrow.\" He waited again. \"I am come ready and unarmed,\"\nhe repeated.\n\n'The unwieldy old man, lowering his big forehead like an ox under a\nyoke, made an effort to rise, clutching at the flintlock pistols on his\nknees. From his throat came gurgling, choking, inhuman sounds, and his\ntwo attendants helped him from behind. People remarked that the ring\nwhich he had dropped on his lap fell and rolled against the foot of\nthe white man, and that poor Jim glanced down at the talisman that had\nopened for him the door of fame, love, and success within the wall of\nforests fringed with white foam, within the coast that under the western\nsun looks like the very stronghold of the night. Doramin, struggling to\nkeep his feet, made with his two supporters a swaying, tottering group;\nhis little eyes stared with an expression of mad pain, of rage, with\na ferocious glitter, which the bystanders noticed; and then, while Jim\nstood stiffened and with bared head in the light of torches, looking him\nstraight in the face, he clung heavily with his left arm round the neck\nof a bowed youth, and lifting deliberately his right, shot his son's\nfriend through the chest.\n\n'The crowd, which had fallen apart behind Jim as soon as Doramin had\nraised his hand, rushed tumultuously forward after the shot. They say\nthat the white man sent right and left at all those faces a proud and\nunflinching glance. Then with his hand over his lips he fell forward,\ndead.\n\n'And that's the end. He passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart,\nforgotten, unforgiven, and excessively romantic. Not in the wildest days\nof his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring shape of such an\nextraordinary success! For it may very well be that in the short moment\nof his last proud and unflinching glance, he had beheld the face of that\nopportunity which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side.\n\n'But we can see him, an obscure conqueror of fame, tearing himself out\nof the arms of a jealous love at the sign, at the call of his exalted\negoism. He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless\nwedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct. Is he satisfied--quite, now, I\nwonder? We ought to know. He is one of us--and have I not stood up once,\nlike an evoked ghost, to answer for his eternal constancy? Was I so very\nwrong after all? Now he is no more, there are days when the reality of\nhis existence comes to me with an immense, with an overwhelming force;\nand yet upon my honour there are moments, too when he passes from my\neyes like a disembodied spirit astray amongst the passions of this\nearth, ready to surrender himself faithfully to the claim of his own\nworld of shades.\n\n'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and the poor girl is\nleading a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has\naged greatly of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is\n\"preparing to leave all this; preparing to leave . . .\" while he waves\nhis hand sadly at his butterflies.'","chapter_length":6740.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 43 -45","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210126121516\/https:\/\/www.sparknotes.com\/lit\/lordjim\/section12\/","summary_text":"Swayed by the people's faith in Jim and his own fear of risking his son Dain Waris, Doramin agrees to let Gentleman Brown and his men escape.

Tamb'Itam is sent downriver to notify Dain Waris that Brown is to be allowed to pass. He takes with him Stein's silver ring as a token of his identity. Jim sends Cornelius to Brown with a note informing him that he will be allowed to go. Cornelius delivers the note, then tells Brown that an armed party headed by Dain Waris, the very man who ambushed Brown initially, waits downstream. Cornelius also tells Brown that there is an alternate river channel that will take him directly behind Dain Waris's camp, and that he, Cornelius, can guide Brown's men down it. Two hours before dawn, in a thick fog, Brown and his men head down the river. Jim calls out that he will try to send them some food. Unbeknownst to those ashore, Cornelius accompanies Brown. When they reach the alternate channel, Cornelius takes over the navigation. Meanwhile, Tamb'Itam reaches Dain Waris's camp with news of the truce. He gives Dain Waris the silver ring, which Dain Waris slips on his finger. A moment later, Gentleman Brown lands his boat behind the camp to take his revenge \"upon the world.\" He and his men open fire. Many fall dead, including Dain Waris, who takes a bullet in the forehead. Brown and his men leave as quickly as they came. Tamb'Itam, who has not been hurt, rushes to his canoe to get the news to Doramin and Jim. At the water's edge, he finds Cornelius struggling to launch a boat and escape. Tamb'Itam strikes him twice, killing him. Marlow digresses for a moment to report that a ship's boat was picked up a month after the massacre in the middle of the Indian Ocean. On board were Brown and two of his men, who claimed that they had been transporting a cargo of sugar when their ship sprung a leak and sunk. The two men died aboard the rescue vehicle; Brown has survived to tell Marlow this story. Returning to the main narrative, Marlow recounts Tamb'Itam's arrival back in Patusan. He finds Jewel, who immediately fears Doramin's wrath for the death of his son. Next he carries the news to Jim, who prepares to go fight. Tamb'Itam reluctantly informs him that he is no longer safe among the people of Patusan. This realization hits Jim hard. Tamb'Itam and Jewel urge Jim to fight for his life. Jim seems not to hear them and orders that the gates of his compound be opened and his men dismissed. Dain Waris's body is brought to Doramin's courtyard. Stein's silver ring is found on his finger. Doramin lets out a bellow and the crowd begins to murmur, realizing that the ring could only have come from Jim. Jim prepares to leave his house. Jewel reminds him of his promise not to leave her, and he tells her that he would no longer be worth having if he didn't leave. He departs for Doramin's. Tamb'Itam recalls the frightful aspect of the sky, and Marlow notes that a cyclone passed near Patusan on that very day. Jim arrives at Doramin's. Approaching the old man, he declares himself sorrowful and unarmed. Doramin stands, sending the silver ring rolling toward Jim. Doramin shoots Jim through the heart, and Jim falls dead. Marlow ends the narrative reiterating the dark, romantic nature of Jim's life and his \"extraordinary success.\" Yet, for Marlow, Jim remains \"inscrutable at heart,\" and the meaning of the narrative is still in question.","summary_analysis":"Commentary It is Marlow, not Jim, who has the last word on Jim's life, noting simply that \"e is gone, inscrutable at heart. \" The word \"heart\" has been associated with Jim over and over again. He is described both as having a core, or \"heart,\" that is in some way unknowable or confusing, and also as being at the \"heart\" of some vast puzzle. The doubled use of this word points back to some of the earlier incidents of confusion over language  and the failure of language to have a definitive meaning. Jim's life has no definitive meaning either. The two \"hearts\" associated with Jim are also suggestive of one of the fundamental problems of the novel: is Jim in fact representative of something larger than himself? Is there an \"us\" that he is \"one of\"? Whether he is at the heart of the inscrutable or merely inscrutable at heart is the fundamental question Marlow must answer. By deferring to Stein, and speaking of Stein's approaching end, and by finishing the narrative in a manuscript rather than in another session of storytelling, Marlow avoids the question. Perhaps it is a question that cannot be answered at all; as Marlow notes, some days Jim seems very real to him, some days Jim seems not to have existed at all. As Marlow notes, Jim has \" away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless wedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct.\" Marlow thus assigns Jim's story to the realm of romance. The ending of Lord Jim suggests more of a fatal collision between romance and realism than any sort of viable, pure romance, though. Jim's choice of the \"shadowy ideal of conduct\" has led to the deaths of Dain Waris and other men, and to the destruction of Jewel's world. Had Jim not dwelt so fixedly on his failure in the Patna incident, he would have ordered the deaths of Brown and his men, and all would have been well in Patusan. On the other hand, had Jim not dwelt so fixedly on the Patna, he would never have come to Patusan, and arguably not only he but also the people of Patusan are better off for his presence. Idealism and notions of heroism lead to nothing but paradox and sadness. This novel has more in common with Hemingway's tales of damaged and disillusioned men or T.S. Eliot's narratives of the forlorn and impotent than it does with earlier works in which moral upstandingness leads to death with honor, if not a happy ending complete with riches and beautiful women. That this section contains more of the trappings of traditional swashbuckling romance  is meant to highlight the contrast. The ending is a mixed one: Jim dies, with a curious mixture of honor and shame, in a manner at least somewhat similar to an old-fashioned hero, while Marlow, like one of Hemingway's protagonists, is left alive, sadder but not necessarily wiser. This is also a section heavier in symbolism than most. The fog which envelops Brown and his men as they head downriver contrasts with the extreme clarity with which Marlow last sees Jim, on the beach with the fishermen. It is also indicative of the amorphous morality of both Brown's and Jim's actions. Brown, after all, thinks he has been double-crossed, based on the information Cornelius has given him. Jim, as we have already seen, is caught in a bind. The night of the Patna's accident was crystal-clear and still; nothing should have obscured Jim's decision-making then. Because he failed then, yet has held on to his ideals, situations no longer have clear solutions. Brown, too, although he seems to be acting logically, is also punished, by being shipwrecked soon afterward and dying a long, drawn-out death. Weather, though, is the primary vehicle for symbolic content. When the fog clears off, Tamb'Itam reports, the sky is in turmoil. Marlow attributes this to a cyclone passing nearby. This is another moment when romance and realism are at odds. In a romantic world, the cyclone would have descended upon Patusan at the moment of Jim's death, symbolizing the disorder in the world that led to the destruction of our hero. In a realistic world, weather would be ordinary and meaningless. The cyclone's close approach suggests a failure of both models; somehow, Jim's death must be given import, yet the issues surrounding it are too muddled and romance too outmoded for the full symbolic performance to occur. This cyclone should be contrasted to the squall that hits the Patna, as well as to the rumored hurricane that wipes out Chester and Robinson's guano-collecting expedition to the Walpole Reef. Here, finally, the storm--the symbol of higher powers or order--fails to impose its meaning.","summary_length":637.0,"analysis_length":791.0,"chap_int":45,"previous summary id":["chapter 44","chapter 44"],"previous chapter":["Before dawn, Brown and his group head downriver.

Some critics feel that Jim's actions are equivalent to a suicide; others say his death is a triumph. In Jim's mind, he has no choice.

On Patusan, he has conquered fear and shame; he refuses to live in guilt in again. He stands up to his principles and faces death bravely. Conrad presents Lord Jim as a tragic hero who has atoned for his past sin. The climax of the novel comes in this final chapter of the book. Until the end, Conrad does not disclose that Jim is dead, thereby keeping the reader in suspense and totally involved in the story. The Mood of the last chapter is totally tragic. Jewel cries out to Jim, begging him to flee or to fight. When he refuses, she calls him a liar and says she will never forgive him. Doramin cries out in pain over the dead body of his son. When Jim presents himself before Doramin, the ring which has given fame and honor to Jim rolls to the ground and symbolizes his tragic fall from grace with the Bugis. Though Jim falls from honor in the eyes of the natives, he dies a proud man. According to his principles, he has done the correct thing. He has not \\\"jumped\\\" again; therefore, he dies with self-esteem and in personal triumph.

The town had a festive\nair; here and there men, still with spears or guns in their hands, could\nbe seen moving or standing on the shore in groups. Chinamen's shops had\nbeen opened early; but the market-place was empty, and a sentry, still\nposted at the corner of the fort, made out Tamb' Itam, and shouted to\nthose within. The gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam jumped ashore and ran\nin headlong. The first person he met was the girl coming down from the\nhouse.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, disordered, panting, with trembling lips and wild eyes,\nstood for a time before her as if a sudden spell had been laid on him.\nThen he broke out very quickly: \"They have killed Dain Waris and many\nmore.\" She clapped her hands, and her first words were, \"Shut the\ngates.\" Most of the fortmen had gone back to their houses, but Tamb'\nItam hurried on the few who remained for their turn of duty within. The\ngirl stood in the middle of the courtyard while the others ran about.\n\"Doramin,\" she cried despairingly, as Tamb' Itam passed her. Next time\nhe went by he answered her thought rapidly, \"Yes. But we have all the\npowder in Patusan.\" She caught him by the arm, and, pointing at the\nhouse, \"Call him out,\" she whispered, trembling.\n\n'Tamb' Itam ran up the steps. His master was sleeping. \"It is I, Tamb'\nItam,\" he cried at the door, \"with tidings that cannot wait.\" He saw\nJim turn over on the pillow and open his eyes, and he burst out at\nonce. \"This, Tuan, is a day of evil, an accursed day.\" His master raised\nhimself on his elbow to listen--just as Dain Waris had done. And then\nTamb' Itam began his tale, trying to relate the story in order, calling\nDain Waris Panglima, and saying: \"The Panglima then called out to the\nchief of his own boatmen, 'Give Tamb' Itam something to eat'\"--when\nhis master put his feet to the ground and looked at him with such a\ndiscomposed face that the words remained in his throat.\n\n'\"Speak out,\" said Jim. \"Is he dead?\" \"May you live long,\" cried Tamb'\nItam. \"It was a most cruel treachery. He ran out at the first shots and\nfell.\" . . . His master walked to the window and with his fist struck\nat the shutter. The room was made light; and then in a steady voice, but\nspeaking fast, he began to give him orders to assemble a fleet of boats\nfor immediate pursuit, go to this man, to the other--send messengers;\nand as he talked he sat down on the bed, stooping to lace his boots\nhurriedly, and suddenly looked up. \"Why do you stand here?\" he asked\nvery red-faced. \"Waste no time.\" Tamb' Itam did not move. \"Forgive me,\nTuan, but . . . but,\" he began to stammer. \"What?\" cried his master\naloud, looking terrible, leaning forward with his hands gripping the\nedge of the bed. \"It is not safe for thy servant to go out amongst the\npeople,\" said Tamb' Itam, after hesitating a moment.\n\n'Then Jim understood. He had retreated from one world, for a small\nmatter of an impulsive jump, and now the other, the work of his own\nhands, had fallen in ruins upon his head. It was not safe for his\nservant to go out amongst his own people! I believe that in that very\nmoment he had decided to defy the disaster in the only way it occurred\nto him such a disaster could be defied; but all I know is that, without\na word, he came out of his room and sat before the long table, at the\nhead of which he was accustomed to regulate the affairs of his world,\nproclaiming daily the truth that surely lived in his heart. The dark\npowers should not rob him twice of his peace. He sat like a stone\nfigure. Tamb' Itam, deferential, hinted at preparations for defence.\nThe girl he loved came in and spoke to him, but he made a sign with his\nhand, and she was awed by the dumb appeal for silence in it. She went\nout on the verandah and sat on the threshold, as if to guard him with\nher body from dangers outside.\n\n'What thoughts passed through his head--what memories? Who can tell?\nEverything was gone, and he who had been once unfaithful to his trust\nhad lost again all men's confidence. It was then, I believe, he tried\nto write--to somebody--and gave it up. Loneliness was closing on him.\nPeople had trusted him with their lives--only for that; and yet they\ncould never, as he had said, never be made to understand him. Those\nwithout did not hear him make a sound. Later, towards the evening, he\ncame to the door and called for Tamb' Itam. \"Well?\" he asked. \"There is\nmuch weeping. Much anger too,\" said Tamb' Itam. Jim looked up at him.\n\"You know,\" he murmured. \"Yes, Tuan,\" said Tamb' Itam. \"Thy servant does\nknow, and the gates are closed. We shall have to fight.\" \"Fight! What\nfor?\" he asked. \"For our lives.\" \"I have no life,\" he said. Tamb' Itam\nheard a cry from the girl at the door. \"Who knows?\" said Tamb' Itam.\n\"By audacity and cunning we may even escape. There is much fear in men's\nhearts too.\" He went out, thinking vaguely of boats and of open sea,\nleaving Jim and the girl together.\n\n'I haven't the heart to set down here such glimpses as she had given\nme of the hour or more she passed in there wrestling with him for the\npossession of her happiness. Whether he had any hope--what he expected,\nwhat he imagined--it is impossible to say. He was inflexible, and with\nthe growing loneliness of his obstinacy his spirit seemed to rise above\nthe ruins of his existence. She cried \"Fight!\" into his ear. She could\nnot understand. There was nothing to fight for. He was going to prove\nhis power in another way and conquer the fatal destiny itself. He came\nout into the courtyard, and behind him, with streaming hair, wild\nof face, breathless, she staggered out and leaned on the side of the\ndoorway. \"Open the gates,\" he ordered. Afterwards, turning to those of\nhis men who were inside, he gave them leave to depart to their homes.\n\"For how long, Tuan?\" asked one of them timidly. \"For all life,\" he\nsaid, in a sombre tone.\n\n'A hush had fallen upon the town after the outburst of wailing and\nlamentation that had swept over the river, like a gust of wind from the\nopened abode of sorrow. But rumours flew in whispers, filling the hearts\nwith consternation and horrible doubts. The robbers were coming back,\nbringing many others with them, in a great ship, and there would be no\nrefuge in the land for any one. A sense of utter insecurity as during\nan earthquake pervaded the minds of men, who whispered their suspicions,\nlooking at each other as if in the presence of some awful portent.\n\n'The sun was sinking towards the forests when Dain Waris's body was\nbrought into Doramin's campong. Four men carried it in, covered decently\nwith a white sheet which the old mother had sent out down to the gate to\nmeet her son on his return. They laid him at Doramin's feet, and the old\nman sat still for a long time, one hand on each knee, looking down. The\nfronds of palms swayed gently, and the foliage of fruit trees stirred\nabove his head. Every single man of his people was there, fully armed,\nwhen the old nakhoda at last raised his eyes. He moved them slowly over\nthe crowd, as if seeking for a missing face. Again his chin sank on his\nbreast. The whispers of many men mingled with the slight rustling of the\nleaves.\n\n'The Malay who had brought Tamb' Itam and the girl to Samarang was there\ntoo. \"Not so angry as many,\" he said to me, but struck with a great\nawe and wonder at the \"suddenness of men's fate, which hangs over their\nheads like a cloud charged with thunder.\" He told me that when Dain\nWaris's body was uncovered at a sign of Doramin's, he whom they often\ncalled the white lord's friend was disclosed lying unchanged with his\neyelids a little open as if about to wake. Doramin leaned forward a\nlittle more, like one looking for something fallen on the ground. His\neyes searched the body from its feet to its head, for the wound maybe.\nIt was in the forehead and small; and there was no word spoken while\none of the by-standers, stooping, took off the silver ring from the cold\nstiff hand. In silence he held it up before Doramin. A murmur of dismay\nand horror ran through the crowd at the sight of that familiar token.\nThe old nakhoda stared at it, and suddenly let out one great fierce cry,\ndeep from the chest, a roar of pain and fury, as mighty as the bellow of\na wounded bull, bringing great fear into men's hearts, by the magnitude\nof his anger and his sorrow that could be plainly discerned without\nwords. There was a great stillness afterwards for a space, while the\nbody was being borne aside by four men. They laid it down under a tree,\nand on the instant, with one long shriek, all the women of the household\nbegan to wail together; they mourned with shrill cries; the sun\nwas setting, and in the intervals of screamed lamentations the high\nsing-song voices of two old men intoning the Koran chanted alone.\n\n'About this time Jim, leaning on a gun-carriage, looked at the river,\nand turned his back on the house; and the girl, in the doorway, panting\nas if she had run herself to a standstill, was looking at him across the\nyard. Tamb' Itam stood not far from his master, waiting patiently for\nwhat might happen. All at once Jim, who seemed to be lost in quiet\nthought, turned to him and said, \"Time to finish this.\"\n\n'\"Tuan?\" said Tamb' Itam, advancing with alacrity. He did not know what\nhis master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started\ntoo and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of\nthe people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about\nhalf-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful\ncontemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against\nthe gun. \"Will you fight?\" she cried. \"There is nothing to fight for,\"\nhe said; \"nothing is lost.\" Saying this he made a step towards her.\n\"Will you fly?\" she cried again. \"There is no escape,\" he said, stopping\nshort, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes.\n\"And you shall go?\" she said slowly. He bent his head. \"Ah!\" she\nexclaimed, peering at him as it were, \"you are mad or false. Do you\nremember the night I prayed you to leave me, and you said that you could\nnot? That it was impossible! Impossible! Do you remember you said you\nwould never leave me? Why? I asked you for no promise. You promised\nunasked--remember.\" \"Enough, poor girl,\" he said. \"I should not be worth\nhaving.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam said that while they were talking she would laugh loud and\nsenselessly like one under the visitation of God. His master put his\nhands to his head. He was fully dressed as for every day, but without\na hat. She stopped laughing suddenly. \"For the last time,\" she cried\nmenacingly, \"will you defend yourself?\" \"Nothing can touch me,\" he said\nin a last flicker of superb egoism. Tamb' Itam saw her lean forward\nwhere she stood, open her arms, and run at him swiftly. She flung\nherself upon his breast and clasped him round the neck.\n\n'\"Ah! but I shall hold thee thus,\" she cried. . . . \"Thou art mine!\"\n\n'She sobbed on his shoulder. The sky over Patusan was blood-red,\nimmense, streaming like an open vein. An enormous sun nestled crimson\namongst the tree-tops, and the forest below had a black and forbidding\nface.\n\n'Tamb' Itam tells me that on that evening the aspect of the heavens was\nangry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know that on that very\nday a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was\nhardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.\n\n'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim catch her arms, trying to unclasp her\nhands. She hung on them with her head fallen back; her hair touched the\nground. \"Come here!\" his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped to ease\nher down. It was difficult to separate her fingers. Jim, bending\nover her, looked earnestly upon her face, and all at once ran to the\nlanding-stage. Tamb' Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw\nthat she had struggled up to her feet. She ran after them a few steps,\nthen fell down heavily on her knees. \"Tuan! Tuan!\" called Tamb' Itam,\n\"look back;\" but Jim was already in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand.\nHe did not look back. Tamb' Itam had just time to scramble in after\nhim when the canoe floated clear. The girl was then on her knees, with\nclasped hands, at the water-gate. She remained thus for a time in\na supplicating attitude before she sprang up. \"You are false!\" she\nscreamed out after Jim. \"Forgive me,\" he cried. \"Never! Never!\" she\ncalled back.\n\n'Tamb' Itam took the paddle from Jim's hands, it being unseemly that he\nshould sit while his lord paddled. When they reached the other shore his\nmaster forbade him to come any farther; but Tamb' Itam did follow him at\na distance, walking up the slope to Doramin's campong.\n\n'It was beginning to grow dark. Torches twinkled here and there. Those\nthey met seemed awestruck, and stood aside hastily to let Jim pass. The\nwailing of women came from above. The courtyard was full of armed Bugis\nwith their followers, and of Patusan people.\n\n'I do not know what this gathering really meant. Were these preparations\nfor war, or for vengeance, or to repulse a threatened invasion? Many\ndays elapsed before the people had ceased to look out, quaking, for\nthe return of the white men with long beards and in rags, whose exact\nrelation to their own white man they could never understand. Even for\nthose simple minds poor Jim remains under a cloud.\n\n'Doramin, alone! immense and desolate, sat in his arm-chair with the\npair of flintlock pistols on his knees, faced by a armed throng. When\nJim appeared, at somebody's exclamation, all the heads turned round\ntogether, and then the mass opened right and left, and he walked up a\nlane of averted glances. Whispers followed him; murmurs: \"He has worked\nall the evil.\" \"He hath a charm.\" . . . He heard them--perhaps!\n\n'When he came up into the light of torches the wailing of the women\nceased suddenly. Doramin did not lift his head, and Jim stood silent\nbefore him for a time. Then he looked to the left, and moved in that\ndirection with measured steps. Dain Waris's mother crouched at the head\nof the body, and the grey dishevelled hair concealed her face. Jim came\nup slowly, looked at his dead friend, lifting the sheet, than dropped it\nwithout a word. Slowly he walked back.\n\n'\"He came! He came!\" was running from lip to lip, making a murmur to\nwhich he moved. \"He hath taken it upon his own head,\" a voice said\naloud. He heard this and turned to the crowd. \"Yes. Upon my head.\" A few\npeople recoiled. Jim waited awhile before Doramin, and then said gently,\n\"I am come in sorrow.\" He waited again. \"I am come ready and unarmed,\"\nhe repeated.\n\n'The unwieldy old man, lowering his big forehead like an ox under a\nyoke, made an effort to rise, clutching at the flintlock pistols on his\nknees. From his throat came gurgling, choking, inhuman sounds, and his\ntwo attendants helped him from behind. People remarked that the ring\nwhich he had dropped on his lap fell and rolled against the foot of\nthe white man, and that poor Jim glanced down at the talisman that had\nopened for him the door of fame, love, and success within the wall of\nforests fringed with white foam, within the coast that under the western\nsun looks like the very stronghold of the night. Doramin, struggling to\nkeep his feet, made with his two supporters a swaying, tottering group;\nhis little eyes stared with an expression of mad pain, of rage, with\na ferocious glitter, which the bystanders noticed; and then, while Jim\nstood stiffened and with bared head in the light of torches, looking him\nstraight in the face, he clung heavily with his left arm round the neck\nof a bowed youth, and lifting deliberately his right, shot his son's\nfriend through the chest.\n\n'The crowd, which had fallen apart behind Jim as soon as Doramin had\nraised his hand, rushed tumultuously forward after the shot. They say\nthat the white man sent right and left at all those faces a proud and\nunflinching glance. Then with his hand over his lips he fell forward,\ndead.\n\n'And that's the end. He passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart,\nforgotten, unforgiven, and excessively romantic. Not in the wildest days\nof his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring shape of such an\nextraordinary success! For it may very well be that in the short moment\nof his last proud and unflinching glance, he had beheld the face of that\nopportunity which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side.\n\n'But we can see him, an obscure conqueror of fame, tearing himself out\nof the arms of a jealous love at the sign, at the call of his exalted\negoism. He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless\nwedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct. Is he satisfied--quite, now, I\nwonder? We ought to know. He is one of us--and have I not stood up once,\nlike an evoked ghost, to answer for his eternal constancy? Was I so very\nwrong after all? Now he is no more, there are days when the reality of\nhis existence comes to me with an immense, with an overwhelming force;\nand yet upon my honour there are moments, too when he passes from my\neyes like a disembodied spirit astray amongst the passions of this\nearth, ready to surrender himself faithfully to the claim of his own\nworld of shades.\n\n'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and the poor girl is\nleading a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has\naged greatly of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is\n\"preparing to leave all this; preparing to leave . . .\" while he waves\nhis hand sadly at his butterflies.'","chapter_length":2980.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 45","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180820051943\/http:\/\/www.pinkmonkey.com\/booknotes\/monkeynotes\/pmLordJim54.asp","summary_text":"Tamb'Itam paddles madly until he reaches the village.

Some critics feel that Jim's actions are equivalent to a suicide; others say his death is a triumph. In Jim's mind, he has no choice. He must present himself to Doramin, for he has pledged his life over Brown. In spite of the pleas of Jewel and Tamb'Itam, he must not jump away again; he cannot flee. On Patusan, he has conquered fear and shame; he refuses to live in guilt in again. He stands up to his principles and faces death bravely. Conrad presents Lord Jim as a tragic hero who has atoned for his past sin. The climax of the novel comes in this final chapter of the book. Until the end, Conrad does not disclose that Jim is dead, thereby keeping the reader in suspense and totally involved in the story. The Mood of the last chapter is totally tragic. Jewel cries out to Jim, begging him to flee or to fight. When he refuses, she calls him a liar and says she will never forgive him. Doramin cries out in pain over the dead body of his son. When Jim presents himself before Doramin, the ring which has given fame and honor to Jim rolls to the ground and symbolizes his tragic fall from grace with the Bugis. Though Jim falls from honor in the eyes of the natives, he dies a proud man. According to his principles, he has done the correct thing. He has not \"jumped\" again; therefore, he dies with self-esteem and in personal triumph. It is an appropriate romantic death, for a totally romantic character.","summary_length":272.0,"analysis_length":271.0,"chap_int":45,"previous summary id":["chapter 44","chapter 44"],"previous chapter":["Before dawn, Brown and his group head downriver.

Chapter Forty Four describes how, after passing Jim at the mouth of the creek, Brown, Cornelius and the rest of the party travel down a by-channel as directed by Cornelius. They are able to do this unnoticed as it is still misty. Brown orders his men to load their guns and says he will give them a chance to get even with 'them'. . . Meanwhile, Tamb' Itam has reached Dain Waris and has given him Jim's message . Whilst Dain Waris's men make a watch on the mainstream, Brown takes his revenge 'on the world' 'with an act of cold-blooded ferocity'. He lands on the other side of the island opposite the Bugis camp and leads his men across. Cornelius tries to slink away, but after a scuffle with Brown he resigns himself to leading them to Dain Waris. Brown's men shoot at this camp three times and Dain Waris is shot in the forehead on the second discharge. . . After this, 'the white men' retire and Brown feels that his account has been settled: 'It was not a vulgar and treacherous massacre; it was a lesson, a retribution ...' When Brown's party leave, they take Cornelius's boat with them. A month later, a story is told that Brown and two of his men survive the schooner springing a leak and are rescued. The two men die on board the steamer that rescues them, but Brown lives long enough to be seen by Marlow months later. . . Tamb' Itam strikes Cornelius twice after the shooting and killed him.

There are many survivors of Dain Waris's party, but they do not know who struck the blow or if they have been victims of a betrayal. . . In Chapter Forty Five, Tamb' Itam tells Jewel and then Jim about the events surrounding the murder of Dain Waris. Jim wants him to send messages to assemble a fleet of boats to capture Brown. However, Tamb' Itam tells him it is not safe for him  to go out amongst the people. Later, towards the evening, Tamb' Itam says there is a lot of anger and they will have to fight for their lives; Jim replies that he has no life. . . The narrative then shifts to Doramin. His son's body is brought to him and one of the bystanders removes the ring from Dain Waris's finger and holds it up before Doramin: 'A murmur of dismay and horror ran through the crowd at the sight of that familiar token.' Doramin lets out a roar of pain and fury and sounds 'like a wounded bull'. . . The narrative switches to Jim as he tells Jewel and Tamb' Itam that it is time to finish this.

She asks Jim for the last time if he will defend himself and he replies , 'nothing can touch me'. She holds on to him and Tamb' Itam has to help ease her off. Jim looks earnestly at her face and then runs to the landing stage. Tamb' Itam asks Tuan Jim to look back, but he is already in a canoe. Tamb' Itam has just enough time to scramble in with him.

The boat entered a narrow\nby-channel, where it was pushed by the oar-blades set into crumbling\nbanks, and there was a gloom as if enormous black wings had been\noutspread above the mist that filled its depth to the summits of the\ntrees. The branches overhead showered big drops through the gloomy fog.\nAt a mutter from Cornelius, Brown ordered his men to load. \"I'll\ngive you a chance to get even with them before we're done, you dismal\ncripples, you,\" he said to his gang. \"Mind you don't throw it away--you\nhounds.\" Low growls answered that speech. Cornelius showed much fussy\nconcern for the safety of his canoe.\n\n'Meantime Tamb' Itam had reached the end of his journey. The fog had\ndelayed him a little, but he had paddled steadily, keeping in touch with\nthe south bank. By-and-by daylight came like a glow in a ground glass\nglobe. The shores made on each side of the river a dark smudge, in which\none could detect hints of columnar forms and shadows of twisted branches\nhigh up. The mist was still thick on the water, but a good watch was\nbeing kept, for as Iamb' Itam approached the camp the figures of two men\nemerged out of the white vapour, and voices spoke to him boisterously.\nHe answered, and presently a canoe lay alongside, and he exchanged news\nwith the paddlers. All was well. The trouble was over. Then the men in\nthe canoe let go their grip on the side of his dug-out and incontinently\nfell out of sight. He pursued his way till he heard voices coming to him\nquietly over the water, and saw, under the now lifting, swirling mist,\nthe glow of many little fires burning on a sandy stretch, backed by\nlofty thin timber and bushes. There again a look-out was kept, for he\nwas challenged. He shouted his name as the two last sweeps of his paddle\nran his canoe up on the strand. It was a big camp. Men crouched in many\nlittle knots under a subdued murmur of early morning talk. Many thin\nthreads of smoke curled slowly on the white mist. Little shelters,\nelevated above the ground, had been built for the chiefs. Muskets were\nstacked in small pyramids, and long spears were stuck singly into the\nsand near the fires.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, assuming an air of importance, demanded to be led to Dain\nWaris. He found the friend of his white lord lying on a raised couch\nmade of bamboo, and sheltered by a sort of shed of sticks covered with\nmats. Dain Waris was awake, and a bright fire was burning before his\nsleeping-place, which resembled a rude shrine. The only son of nakhoda\nDoramin answered his greeting kindly. Tamb' Itam began by handing him\nthe ring which vouched for the truth of the messenger's words. Dain\nWaris, reclining on his elbow, bade him speak and tell all the news.\nBeginning with the consecrated formula, \"The news is good,\" Tamb' Itam\ndelivered Jim's own words. The white men, deputing with the consent of\nall the chiefs, were to be allowed to pass down the river. In answer to\na question or two Tamb' Itam then reported the proceedings of the last\ncouncil. Dain Waris listened attentively to the end, toying with the\nring which ultimately he slipped on the forefinger of his right hand.\nAfter hearing all he had to say he dismissed Tamb' Itam to have food\nand rest. Orders for the return in the afternoon were given immediately.\nAfterwards Dain Waris lay down again, open-eyed, while his personal\nattendants were preparing his food at the fire, by which Tamb' Itam also\nsat talking to the men who lounged up to hear the latest intelligence\nfrom the town. The sun was eating up the mist. A good watch was kept\nupon the reach of the main stream where the boat of the whites was\nexpected to appear every moment.\n\n'It was then that Brown took his revenge upon the world which, after\ntwenty years of contemptuous and reckless bullying, refused him the\ntribute of a common robber's success. It was an act of cold-blooded\nferocity, and it consoled him on his deathbed like a memory of an\nindomitable defiance. Stealthily he landed his men on the other side\nof the island opposite to the Bugis camp, and led them across. After a\nshort but quite silent scuffle, Cornelius, who had tried to slink away\nat the moment of landing, resigned himself to show the way where the\nundergrowth was most sparse. Brown held both his skinny hands together\nbehind his back in the grip of one vast fist, and now and then impelled\nhim forward with a fierce push. Cornelius remained as mute as a fish,\nabject but faithful to his purpose, whose accomplishment loomed before\nhim dimly. At the edge of the patch of forest Brown's men spread\nthemselves out in cover and waited. The camp was plain from end to end\nbefore their eyes, and no one looked their way. Nobody even dreamed that\nthe white men could have any knowledge of the narrow channel at the back\nof the island. When he judged the moment come, Brown yelled, \"Let them\nhave it,\" and fourteen shots rang out like one.\n\n'Tamb' Itam told me the surprise was so great that, except for those who\nfell dead or wounded, not a soul of them moved for quite an appreciable\ntime after the first discharge. Then a man screamed, and after that\nscream a great yell of amazement and fear went up from all the throats.\nA blind panic drove these men in a surging swaying mob to and fro along\nthe shore like a herd of cattle afraid of the water. Some few jumped\ninto the river then, but most of them did so only after the last\ndischarge. Three times Brown's men fired into the ruck, Brown, the only\none in view, cursing and yelling, \"Aim low! aim low!\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam says that, as for him, he understood at the first volley\nwhat had happened. Though untouched he fell down and lay as if dead,\nbut with his eyes open. At the sound of the first shots Dain Waris,\nreclining on the couch, jumped up and ran out upon the open shore, just\nin time to receive a bullet in his forehead at the second discharge.\nTamb' Itam saw him fling his arms wide open before he fell. Then, he\nsays, a great fear came upon him--not before. The white men retired as\nthey had come--unseen.\n\n'Thus Brown balanced his account with the evil fortune. Notice that even\nin this awful outbreak there is a superiority as of a man who carries\nright--the abstract thing--within the envelope of his common desires.\nIt was not a vulgar and treacherous massacre; it was a lesson, a\nretribution--a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our\nnature which, I am afraid, is not so very far under the surface as we\nlike to think.\n\n'Afterwards the whites depart unseen by Tamb' Itam, and seem to vanish\nfrom before men's eyes altogether; and the schooner, too, vanishes after\nthe manner of stolen goods. But a story is told of a white long-boat\npicked up a month later in the Indian Ocean by a cargo steamer. Two\nparched, yellow, glassy-eyed, whispering skeletons in her recognised\nthe authority of a third, who declared that his name was Brown. His\nschooner, he reported, bound south with a cargo of Java sugar, had\nsprung a bad leak and sank under his feet. He and his companions were\nthe survivors of a crew of six. The two died on board the steamer which\nrescued them. Brown lived to be seen by me, and I can testify that he\nhad played his part to the last.\n\n'It seems, however, that in going away they had neglected to cast off\nCornelius's canoe. Cornelius himself Brown had let go at the beginning\nof the shooting, with a kick for a parting benediction. Tamb' Itam,\nafter arising from amongst the dead, saw the Nazarene running up and\ndown the shore amongst the corpses and the expiring fires. He uttered\nlittle cries. Suddenly he rushed to the water, and made frantic efforts\nto get one of the Bugis boats into the water. \"Afterwards, till he had\nseen me,\" related Tamb' Itam, \"he stood looking at the heavy canoe and\nscratching his head.\" \"What became of him?\" I asked. Tamb' Itam, staring\nhard at me, made an expressive gesture with his right arm. \"Twice I\nstruck, Tuan,\" he said. \"When he beheld me approaching he cast himself\nviolently on the ground and made a great outcry, kicking. He screeched\nlike a frightened hen till he felt the point; then he was still, and lay\nstaring at me while his life went out of his eyes.\"\n\n'This done, Tamb' Itam did not tarry. He understood the importance of\nbeing the first with the awful news at the fort. There were, of course,\nmany survivors of Dain Waris's party; but in the extremity of panic some\nhad swum across the river, others had bolted into the bush. The fact is\nthat they did not know really who struck that blow--whether more white\nrobbers were not coming, whether they had not already got hold of\nthe whole land. They imagined themselves to be the victims of a vast\ntreachery, and utterly doomed to destruction. It is said that some small\nparties did not come in till three days afterwards. However, a few tried\nto make their way back to Patusan at once, and one of the canoes that\nwere patrolling the river that morning was in sight of the camp at\nthe very moment of the attack. It is true that at first the men in her\nleaped overboard and swam to the opposite bank, but afterwards they\nreturned to their boat and started fearfully up-stream. Of these Tamb'\nItam had an hour's advance.''When Tamb' Itam, paddling madly, came into the town-reach, the women,\nthronging the platforms before the houses, were looking out for the\nreturn of Dain Waris's little fleet of boats. The town had a festive\nair; here and there men, still with spears or guns in their hands, could\nbe seen moving or standing on the shore in groups. Chinamen's shops had\nbeen opened early; but the market-place was empty, and a sentry, still\nposted at the corner of the fort, made out Tamb' Itam, and shouted to\nthose within. The gate was wide open. Tamb' Itam jumped ashore and ran\nin headlong. The first person he met was the girl coming down from the\nhouse.\n\n'Tamb' Itam, disordered, panting, with trembling lips and wild eyes,\nstood for a time before her as if a sudden spell had been laid on him.\nThen he broke out very quickly: \"They have killed Dain Waris and many\nmore.\" She clapped her hands, and her first words were, \"Shut the\ngates.\" Most of the fortmen had gone back to their houses, but Tamb'\nItam hurried on the few who remained for their turn of duty within. The\ngirl stood in the middle of the courtyard while the others ran about.\n\"Doramin,\" she cried despairingly, as Tamb' Itam passed her. Next time\nhe went by he answered her thought rapidly, \"Yes. But we have all the\npowder in Patusan.\" She caught him by the arm, and, pointing at the\nhouse, \"Call him out,\" she whispered, trembling.\n\n'Tamb' Itam ran up the steps. His master was sleeping. \"It is I, Tamb'\nItam,\" he cried at the door, \"with tidings that cannot wait.\" He saw\nJim turn over on the pillow and open his eyes, and he burst out at\nonce. \"This, Tuan, is a day of evil, an accursed day.\" His master raised\nhimself on his elbow to listen--just as Dain Waris had done. And then\nTamb' Itam began his tale, trying to relate the story in order, calling\nDain Waris Panglima, and saying: \"The Panglima then called out to the\nchief of his own boatmen, 'Give Tamb' Itam something to eat'\"--when\nhis master put his feet to the ground and looked at him with such a\ndiscomposed face that the words remained in his throat.\n\n'\"Speak out,\" said Jim. \"Is he dead?\" \"May you live long,\" cried Tamb'\nItam. \"It was a most cruel treachery. He ran out at the first shots and\nfell.\" . . . His master walked to the window and with his fist struck\nat the shutter. The room was made light; and then in a steady voice, but\nspeaking fast, he began to give him orders to assemble a fleet of boats\nfor immediate pursuit, go to this man, to the other--send messengers;\nand as he talked he sat down on the bed, stooping to lace his boots\nhurriedly, and suddenly looked up. \"Why do you stand here?\" he asked\nvery red-faced. \"Waste no time.\" Tamb' Itam did not move. \"Forgive me,\nTuan, but . . . but,\" he began to stammer. \"What?\" cried his master\naloud, looking terrible, leaning forward with his hands gripping the\nedge of the bed. \"It is not safe for thy servant to go out amongst the\npeople,\" said Tamb' Itam, after hesitating a moment.\n\n'Then Jim understood. He had retreated from one world, for a small\nmatter of an impulsive jump, and now the other, the work of his own\nhands, had fallen in ruins upon his head. It was not safe for his\nservant to go out amongst his own people! I believe that in that very\nmoment he had decided to defy the disaster in the only way it occurred\nto him such a disaster could be defied; but all I know is that, without\na word, he came out of his room and sat before the long table, at the\nhead of which he was accustomed to regulate the affairs of his world,\nproclaiming daily the truth that surely lived in his heart. The dark\npowers should not rob him twice of his peace. He sat like a stone\nfigure. Tamb' Itam, deferential, hinted at preparations for defence.\nThe girl he loved came in and spoke to him, but he made a sign with his\nhand, and she was awed by the dumb appeal for silence in it. She went\nout on the verandah and sat on the threshold, as if to guard him with\nher body from dangers outside.\n\n'What thoughts passed through his head--what memories? Who can tell?\nEverything was gone, and he who had been once unfaithful to his trust\nhad lost again all men's confidence. It was then, I believe, he tried\nto write--to somebody--and gave it up. Loneliness was closing on him.\nPeople had trusted him with their lives--only for that; and yet they\ncould never, as he had said, never be made to understand him. Those\nwithout did not hear him make a sound. Later, towards the evening, he\ncame to the door and called for Tamb' Itam. \"Well?\" he asked. \"There is\nmuch weeping. Much anger too,\" said Tamb' Itam. Jim looked up at him.\n\"You know,\" he murmured. \"Yes, Tuan,\" said Tamb' Itam. \"Thy servant does\nknow, and the gates are closed. We shall have to fight.\" \"Fight! What\nfor?\" he asked. \"For our lives.\" \"I have no life,\" he said. Tamb' Itam\nheard a cry from the girl at the door. \"Who knows?\" said Tamb' Itam.\n\"By audacity and cunning we may even escape. There is much fear in men's\nhearts too.\" He went out, thinking vaguely of boats and of open sea,\nleaving Jim and the girl together.\n\n'I haven't the heart to set down here such glimpses as she had given\nme of the hour or more she passed in there wrestling with him for the\npossession of her happiness. Whether he had any hope--what he expected,\nwhat he imagined--it is impossible to say. He was inflexible, and with\nthe growing loneliness of his obstinacy his spirit seemed to rise above\nthe ruins of his existence. She cried \"Fight!\" into his ear. She could\nnot understand. There was nothing to fight for. He was going to prove\nhis power in another way and conquer the fatal destiny itself. He came\nout into the courtyard, and behind him, with streaming hair, wild\nof face, breathless, she staggered out and leaned on the side of the\ndoorway. \"Open the gates,\" he ordered. Afterwards, turning to those of\nhis men who were inside, he gave them leave to depart to their homes.\n\"For how long, Tuan?\" asked one of them timidly. \"For all life,\" he\nsaid, in a sombre tone.\n\n'A hush had fallen upon the town after the outburst of wailing and\nlamentation that had swept over the river, like a gust of wind from the\nopened abode of sorrow. But rumours flew in whispers, filling the hearts\nwith consternation and horrible doubts. The robbers were coming back,\nbringing many others with them, in a great ship, and there would be no\nrefuge in the land for any one. A sense of utter insecurity as during\nan earthquake pervaded the minds of men, who whispered their suspicions,\nlooking at each other as if in the presence of some awful portent.\n\n'The sun was sinking towards the forests when Dain Waris's body was\nbrought into Doramin's campong. Four men carried it in, covered decently\nwith a white sheet which the old mother had sent out down to the gate to\nmeet her son on his return. They laid him at Doramin's feet, and the old\nman sat still for a long time, one hand on each knee, looking down. The\nfronds of palms swayed gently, and the foliage of fruit trees stirred\nabove his head. Every single man of his people was there, fully armed,\nwhen the old nakhoda at last raised his eyes. He moved them slowly over\nthe crowd, as if seeking for a missing face. Again his chin sank on his\nbreast. The whispers of many men mingled with the slight rustling of the\nleaves.\n\n'The Malay who had brought Tamb' Itam and the girl to Samarang was there\ntoo. \"Not so angry as many,\" he said to me, but struck with a great\nawe and wonder at the \"suddenness of men's fate, which hangs over their\nheads like a cloud charged with thunder.\" He told me that when Dain\nWaris's body was uncovered at a sign of Doramin's, he whom they often\ncalled the white lord's friend was disclosed lying unchanged with his\neyelids a little open as if about to wake. Doramin leaned forward a\nlittle more, like one looking for something fallen on the ground. His\neyes searched the body from its feet to its head, for the wound maybe.\nIt was in the forehead and small; and there was no word spoken while\none of the by-standers, stooping, took off the silver ring from the cold\nstiff hand. In silence he held it up before Doramin. A murmur of dismay\nand horror ran through the crowd at the sight of that familiar token.\nThe old nakhoda stared at it, and suddenly let out one great fierce cry,\ndeep from the chest, a roar of pain and fury, as mighty as the bellow of\na wounded bull, bringing great fear into men's hearts, by the magnitude\nof his anger and his sorrow that could be plainly discerned without\nwords. There was a great stillness afterwards for a space, while the\nbody was being borne aside by four men. They laid it down under a tree,\nand on the instant, with one long shriek, all the women of the household\nbegan to wail together; they mourned with shrill cries; the sun\nwas setting, and in the intervals of screamed lamentations the high\nsing-song voices of two old men intoning the Koran chanted alone.\n\n'About this time Jim, leaning on a gun-carriage, looked at the river,\nand turned his back on the house; and the girl, in the doorway, panting\nas if she had run herself to a standstill, was looking at him across the\nyard. Tamb' Itam stood not far from his master, waiting patiently for\nwhat might happen. All at once Jim, who seemed to be lost in quiet\nthought, turned to him and said, \"Time to finish this.\"\n\n'\"Tuan?\" said Tamb' Itam, advancing with alacrity. He did not know what\nhis master meant, but as soon as Jim made a movement the girl started\ntoo and walked down into the open space. It seems that no one else of\nthe people of the house was in sight. She tottered slightly, and about\nhalf-way down called out to Jim, who had apparently resumed his peaceful\ncontemplation of the river. He turned round, setting his back against\nthe gun. \"Will you fight?\" she cried. \"There is nothing to fight for,\"\nhe said; \"nothing is lost.\" Saying this he made a step towards her.\n\"Will you fly?\" she cried again. \"There is no escape,\" he said, stopping\nshort, and she stood still also, silent, devouring him with her eyes.\n\"And you shall go?\" she said slowly. He bent his head. \"Ah!\" she\nexclaimed, peering at him as it were, \"you are mad or false. Do you\nremember the night I prayed you to leave me, and you said that you could\nnot? That it was impossible! Impossible! Do you remember you said you\nwould never leave me? Why? I asked you for no promise. You promised\nunasked--remember.\" \"Enough, poor girl,\" he said. \"I should not be worth\nhaving.\"\n\n'Tamb' Itam said that while they were talking she would laugh loud and\nsenselessly like one under the visitation of God. His master put his\nhands to his head. He was fully dressed as for every day, but without\na hat. She stopped laughing suddenly. \"For the last time,\" she cried\nmenacingly, \"will you defend yourself?\" \"Nothing can touch me,\" he said\nin a last flicker of superb egoism. Tamb' Itam saw her lean forward\nwhere she stood, open her arms, and run at him swiftly. She flung\nherself upon his breast and clasped him round the neck.\n\n'\"Ah! but I shall hold thee thus,\" she cried. . . . \"Thou art mine!\"\n\n'She sobbed on his shoulder. The sky over Patusan was blood-red,\nimmense, streaming like an open vein. An enormous sun nestled crimson\namongst the tree-tops, and the forest below had a black and forbidding\nface.\n\n'Tamb' Itam tells me that on that evening the aspect of the heavens was\nangry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know that on that very\nday a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was\nhardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.\n\n'Suddenly Tamb' Itam saw Jim catch her arms, trying to unclasp her\nhands. She hung on them with her head fallen back; her hair touched the\nground. \"Come here!\" his master called, and Tamb' Itam helped to ease\nher down. It was difficult to separate her fingers. Jim, bending\nover her, looked earnestly upon her face, and all at once ran to the\nlanding-stage. Tamb' Itam followed him, but turning his head, he saw\nthat she had struggled up to her feet. She ran after them a few steps,\nthen fell down heavily on her knees. \"Tuan! Tuan!\" called Tamb' Itam,\n\"look back;\" but Jim was already in a canoe, standing up paddle in hand.\nHe did not look back. Tamb' Itam had just time to scramble in after\nhim when the canoe floated clear. The girl was then on her knees, with\nclasped hands, at the water-gate. She remained thus for a time in\na supplicating attitude before she sprang up. \"You are false!\" she\nscreamed out after Jim. \"Forgive me,\" he cried. \"Never! Never!\" she\ncalled back.\n\n'Tamb' Itam took the paddle from Jim's hands, it being unseemly that he\nshould sit while his lord paddled. When they reached the other shore his\nmaster forbade him to come any farther; but Tamb' Itam did follow him at\na distance, walking up the slope to Doramin's campong.\n\n'It was beginning to grow dark. Torches twinkled here and there. Those\nthey met seemed awestruck, and stood aside hastily to let Jim pass. The\nwailing of women came from above. The courtyard was full of armed Bugis\nwith their followers, and of Patusan people.\n\n'I do not know what this gathering really meant. Were these preparations\nfor war, or for vengeance, or to repulse a threatened invasion? Many\ndays elapsed before the people had ceased to look out, quaking, for\nthe return of the white men with long beards and in rags, whose exact\nrelation to their own white man they could never understand. Even for\nthose simple minds poor Jim remains under a cloud.\n\n'Doramin, alone! immense and desolate, sat in his arm-chair with the\npair of flintlock pistols on his knees, faced by a armed throng. When\nJim appeared, at somebody's exclamation, all the heads turned round\ntogether, and then the mass opened right and left, and he walked up a\nlane of averted glances. Whispers followed him; murmurs: \"He has worked\nall the evil.\" \"He hath a charm.\" . . . He heard them--perhaps!\n\n'When he came up into the light of torches the wailing of the women\nceased suddenly. Doramin did not lift his head, and Jim stood silent\nbefore him for a time. Then he looked to the left, and moved in that\ndirection with measured steps. Dain Waris's mother crouched at the head\nof the body, and the grey dishevelled hair concealed her face. Jim came\nup slowly, looked at his dead friend, lifting the sheet, than dropped it\nwithout a word. Slowly he walked back.\n\n'\"He came! He came!\" was running from lip to lip, making a murmur to\nwhich he moved. \"He hath taken it upon his own head,\" a voice said\naloud. He heard this and turned to the crowd. \"Yes. Upon my head.\" A few\npeople recoiled. Jim waited awhile before Doramin, and then said gently,\n\"I am come in sorrow.\" He waited again. \"I am come ready and unarmed,\"\nhe repeated.\n\n'The unwieldy old man, lowering his big forehead like an ox under a\nyoke, made an effort to rise, clutching at the flintlock pistols on his\nknees. From his throat came gurgling, choking, inhuman sounds, and his\ntwo attendants helped him from behind. People remarked that the ring\nwhich he had dropped on his lap fell and rolled against the foot of\nthe white man, and that poor Jim glanced down at the talisman that had\nopened for him the door of fame, love, and success within the wall of\nforests fringed with white foam, within the coast that under the western\nsun looks like the very stronghold of the night. Doramin, struggling to\nkeep his feet, made with his two supporters a swaying, tottering group;\nhis little eyes stared with an expression of mad pain, of rage, with\na ferocious glitter, which the bystanders noticed; and then, while Jim\nstood stiffened and with bared head in the light of torches, looking him\nstraight in the face, he clung heavily with his left arm round the neck\nof a bowed youth, and lifting deliberately his right, shot his son's\nfriend through the chest.\n\n'The crowd, which had fallen apart behind Jim as soon as Doramin had\nraised his hand, rushed tumultuously forward after the shot. They say\nthat the white man sent right and left at all those faces a proud and\nunflinching glance. Then with his hand over his lips he fell forward,\ndead.\n\n'And that's the end. He passes away under a cloud, inscrutable at heart,\nforgotten, unforgiven, and excessively romantic. Not in the wildest days\nof his boyish visions could he have seen the alluring shape of such an\nextraordinary success! For it may very well be that in the short moment\nof his last proud and unflinching glance, he had beheld the face of that\nopportunity which, like an Eastern bride, had come veiled to his side.\n\n'But we can see him, an obscure conqueror of fame, tearing himself out\nof the arms of a jealous love at the sign, at the call of his exalted\negoism. He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless\nwedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct. Is he satisfied--quite, now, I\nwonder? We ought to know. He is one of us--and have I not stood up once,\nlike an evoked ghost, to answer for his eternal constancy? Was I so very\nwrong after all? Now he is no more, there are days when the reality of\nhis existence comes to me with an immense, with an overwhelming force;\nand yet upon my honour there are moments, too when he passes from my\neyes like a disembodied spirit astray amongst the passions of this\nearth, ready to surrender himself faithfully to the claim of his own\nworld of shades.\n\n'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and the poor girl is\nleading a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has\naged greatly of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is\n\"preparing to leave all this; preparing to leave . . .\" while he waves\nhis hand sadly at his butterflies.'","chapter_length":4522.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 44-45","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210215030710\/https:\/\/www.novelguide.com\/lord-jim\/summaries\/chapter44-45","summary_text":"Four and Forty-Five .

Whether or not these causes appear to have relation to each other, they are nevertheless governed by Providence. Boethius then asks how can there be free will in this close-knit chain of events. To this Philosophy asserts that there must indeed be free will, because no rational nature could exist without it. Judgment and the ability to choose are inherent in a rational nature. The more rational a person is, and the more they choose virtue and the pursuit of true happiness in God, the freer that person is. If a person is wicked or enslaved to vice, that person becomes progressively less and less free, and controlled by vice and error. Here Philosophy returns to the subject of the mind of God, and his one act of knowing everything that has occurred, past and present. Just because God knows what a person with free will is going to choose, doesn't mean that he directed it. God knows all things before they happen, but he doesn't interfere with the free will of human beings. Boethius protests, saying that these two things are oppositional. How can God know about something before it happens, but therefore not control or direct the free choices of human beings? Philosophy enters into another long explanation of the mind of God. God does not \\\"know\\\" the world in the same way that human beings do. God is outside of time, so he doesn't view the world in a progression of events. For God no future event is uncertain, no past event forgotten. God knows the world in one single act, which includes knowledge of all the choices of all human beings from the beginning of the world to the end. Therefore he doesn't influence these choices, but he knew of them as part of the whole foreknowledge of the world perceived in one single instance. This raises the problem of the efficacy of prayer, but Philosophy counsels that prayer is the one way of communicating with God. Even if the future is already ordained we still must strive to join ourselves with our Creator through prayer. We are temporal creatures, and we can only understand things in a temporal way. This doesn't mean we can't participate in eternity by striving to be one with God. Philosophy says that it is still important to strive for virtue, for God is always watching and judging. That the world has already happened for God is a mystery to us, but we are temporal and cannot hope to fully understand eternity.\", \"analysis\": \"This last book of The Consolation of Philosophy raises the most questions of any of the books of The Consolation of Philosophy.  The idea of foreknowledge and Providence have been debated for centuries.  This argument was even referred to in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.  There is no reason to believe that this debate will cease anytime soon. What is at issue is a central philosophical question of whether or not the world is predetermined or subject to chance.  Philosophy walks a middle ground here, saying that God knows all things since he perceives the world in one instance of knowing, but in that instance of knowing he didn't force the choices of all the people in the world.  He just knows how it happened, all at once. Since there is no logical way to support this argument, the idea of the single instant of knowing must be taken as given.  Boethius has set up the arguments in the previous books so that this is the only possible solution.  He gives credit to Aristotle for this idea, but the preceding arguments and proofs are all his own.  Providence is the ordering of all things by God, and he had a plan for his world, but he didn't necessarily influence the choices of the people in it.  Fate is simply the events that must occur because, for God, the whole world including all future people and events has already happened.  Philosophy is right to call it a mystery. Free will is very important in this Book because it is a necessary component of Catholic faith.  If there were no free will there would be no accountability for sin on earth, and sin is held accountable and confession, and possibly punishment, are necessary for redemption.  Boethius had to reconcile the idea of free will to the idea of Providence in order to remain orthodox. The passages about the wicked being less free than the virtuous are also a part of the free will argument.  If the wicked have free will, then can their choices could be considered as valid as the choices the virtuous make?  Not so, says Philosophy, for their choices come to be controlled by their vices, not by their sound judgment.  The more evil a human being becomes, the less free and less human he or she becomes. The subject of prayer comes up at the end of this book.  If God knows all things, then what is the use of praying to him?  Philosophy admonishes Boethius that he should not cut off the one communication conduit he has with God.  Prayer is a path to virtue, and the book ends with Philosophy advising Boethius to cultivate virtue as much as possible since God sees and is the judge of all things. The difficulties with this ordering of the world are plain to a modern reader.  For example, even if God does know everything that happens on earth in one instant, he, in his omniscience, can still intervene and could guide the evil towards good if he chose.  This would destroy free will, but would it also take away from the idea that God is also all good?  If he could prevent someone from turning down the path of evil, why doesn't he? Free will must be retained, in order to make human beings accountable for their actions and not merely puppets of God.  Also, the lack of substance of evil  means that God isn't allowing evil to happen, because evil doesn't really exist. Much depends on faith in these five Books of Boethius, but many logical arguments are contained in it, too.  Boethius seems to strain for orthodoxy at times, but that doesn't make the philosophy any less brilliant, or the \\\"consolation\\\" any less real.  Again, a modern reader must never forget the context of Boethius' work: he is in a desperate position, striving for a dollop of happiness amidst misery.  If his work contains logical fallacies and shortcomings, so be it - the object is consolation, and that object, it seems, is achieved.\"}","chapter":"<CHAPTER>\nBOOK V.

But if this cannot\nbe, neither is it possible for there to be chance in accordance with the\ndefinition just given.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'is there, then, nothing which can properly be called\nchance or accident, or is there something to which these names are\nappropriate, though its nature is dark to the vulgar?'\n\n'Our good Aristotle,' says she, 'has defined it concisely in his\n\"Physics,\" and closely in accordance with the truth.'\n\n'How, pray?' said I.\n\n'Thus,' says she: 'Whenever something is done for the sake of a\nparticular end, and for certain reasons some other result than that\ndesigned ensues, this is called chance; for instance, if a man is\ndigging the earth for tillage, and finds a mass of buried gold. Now,\nsuch a find is regarded as accidental; yet it is not \"ex nihilo,\" for it\nhas its proper causes, the unforeseen and unexpected concurrence of\nwhich has brought the chance about. For had not the cultivator been\ndigging, had not the man who hid the money buried it in that precise\nspot, the gold would not have been found. These, then, are the reasons\nwhy the find is a chance one, in that it results from causes which met\ntogether and concurred, not from any intention on the part of the\ndiscoverer. Since neither he who buried the gold nor he who worked in\nthe field _intended_ that the money should be found, but, as I said, it\n_happened_ by coincidence that one dug where the other buried the\ntreasure. We may, then, define chance as being an unexpected result\nflowing from a concurrence of causes where the several factors had some\ndefinite end. But the meeting and concurrence of these causes arises\nfrom that inevitable chain of order which, flowing from the\nfountain-head of Providence, disposes all things in their due time and\nplace.'\n\n\n\nSONG I.\n\nCHANCE.\n\n\n    In the rugged Persian highlands,\n      Where the masters of the bow\n    Skill to feign a flight, and, fleeing,\n      Hurl their darts and pierce the foe;\n    There the Tigris and Euphrates\n      At one source[O] their waters blend,\n    Soon to draw apart, and plainward\n      Each its separate way to wend.\n    When once more their waters mingle\n      In a channel deep and wide,\n    All the flotsam comes together\n      That is borne upon the tide:\n    Ships, and trunks of trees, uprooted\n      In the torrent's wild career,\n    Meet, as 'mid the swirling waters\n      Chance their random way may steer.\n    Yet the shelving of the channel\n      And the flowing water's force\n    Guides each movement, and determines\n      Every floating fragment's course.\n    Thus, where'er the drift of hazard\n      Seems most unrestrained to flow,\n    Chance herself is reined and bitted,\n      And the curb of law doth know.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[O] This is not, of course, literally true, though the Tigris and\nEuphrates rise in the same mountain district.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n'I am following needfully,' said I, 'and I agree that it is as thou\nsayest. But in this series of linked causes is there any freedom left to\nour will, or does the chain of fate bind also the very motions of our\nsouls?'\n\n'There is freedom,' said she; 'nor, indeed, can any creature be\nrational, unless he be endowed with free will. For that which hath the\nnatural use of reason has the faculty of discriminative judgment, and of\nitself distinguishes what is to be shunned or desired. Now, everyone\nseeks what he judges desirable, and avoids what he thinks should be\nshunned. Wherefore, beings endowed with reason possess also the faculty\nof free choice and refusal. But I suppose this faculty not equal alike\nin all. The higher Divine essences possess a clear-sighted judgment, an\nuncorrupt will, and an effective power of accomplishing their wishes.\nHuman souls must needs be comparatively free while they abide in the\ncontemplation of the Divine mind, less free when they pass into bodily\nform, and still less, again, when they are enwrapped in earthly members.\nBut when they are given over to vices, and fall from the possession of\ntheir proper reason, then indeed their condition is utter slavery. For\nwhen they let their gaze fall from the light of highest truth to the\nlower world where darkness reigns, soon ignorance blinds their vision;\nthey are disturbed by baneful affections, by yielding and assenting to\nwhich they help to promote the slavery in which they are involved, and\nare in a manner led captive by reason of their very liberty. Yet He who\nseeth all things from eternity beholdeth these things with the eyes of\nHis providence, and assigneth to each what is predestined for it by its\nmerits:\n\n     '\"All things surveying, all things overhearing.'\"\n\n\n\nSONG II.\n\nTHE TRUE SUN.\n\n\n    Homer with mellifluous tongue\n    Phoebus' glorious light hath sung,\n      Hymning high his praise;\n      Yet _his_ feeble rays\n    Ocean's hollows may not brighten,\n    Nor earth's central gloom enlighten.\n\n    But the might of Him, who skilled\n    This great universe to build,\n      Is not thus confined;\n      Not earth's solid rind,\n    Nor night's blackest canopy,\n    Baffle His all-seeing eye.\n\n    All that is, hath been, shall be,\n    In one glance's compass, He\n      Limitless descries;\n      And, save His, no eyes\n    All the world survey--no, none!\n    _Him_, then, truly name the Sun.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThen said I: 'But now I am once more perplexed by a problem yet more\ndifficult.'\n\n'And what is that?' said she; 'yet, in truth, I can guess what it is\nthat troubles you.'\n\n'It seems,' said I, 'too much of a paradox and a contradiction that God\nshould know all things, and yet there should be free will. For if God\nforesees everything, and can in no wise be deceived, that which\nprovidence foresees to be about to happen must necessarily come to pass.\nWherefore, if from eternity He foreknows not only what men will do, but\nalso their designs and purposes, there can be no freedom of the will,\nseeing that nothing can be done, nor can any sort of purpose be\nentertained, save such as a Divine providence, incapable of being\ndeceived, has perceived beforehand. For if the issues can be turned\naside to some other end than that foreseen by providence, there will not\nthen be any sure foreknowledge of the future, but uncertain conjecture\ninstead, and to think this of God I deem impiety.\n\n'Moreover, I do not approve the reasoning by which some think to solve\nthis puzzle. For they say that it is not because God has foreseen the\ncoming of an event that _therefore_ it is sure to come to pass, but,\nconversely, because something is about to come to pass, it cannot be\nhidden from Divine providence; and accordingly the necessity passes to\nthe opposite side, and it is not that what is foreseen must necessarily\ncome to pass, but that what is about to come to pass must necessarily be\nforeseen. But this is just as if the matter in debate were, which is\ncause and which effect--whether foreknowledge of the future cause of the\nnecessity, or the necessity of the future of the foreknowledge. But we\nneed not be at the pains of demonstrating that, whatsoever be the order\nof the causal sequence, the occurrence of things foreseen is necessary,\neven though the foreknowledge of future events does not in itself\nimpose upon them the necessity of their occurrence. For example, if a\nman be seated, the supposition of his being seated is necessarily true;\nand, conversely, if the supposition of his being seated is true, because\nhe is really seated, he must necessarily be sitting. So, in either case,\nthere is some necessity involved--in this latter case, the necessity of\nthe fact; in the former, of the truth of the statement. But in both\ncases the sitter is not therefore seated because the opinion is true,\nbut rather the opinion is true because antecedently he was sitting as a\nmatter of fact. Thus, though the cause of the truth of the opinion comes\nfrom the other side,[P] yet there is a necessity on both sides alike. We\ncan obviously reason similarly in the case of providence and the future.\nEven if future events are foreseen because they are about to happen, and\ndo not come to pass because they are foreseen, still, all the same,\nthere is a necessity, both that they should be foreseen by God as about\nto come to pass, and that when they are foreseen they should happen, and\nthis is sufficient for the destruction of free will. However, it is\npreposterous to speak of the occurrence of events in time as the cause\nof eternal foreknowledge. And yet if we believe that God foresees future\nevents because they are about to come to pass, what is it but to think\nthat the occurrence of events is the cause of His supreme providence?\nFurther, just as when I _know_ that anything is, that thing\n_necessarily_ is, so when I know that anything will be, it will\n_necessarily_ be. It follows, then, that things foreknown come to pass\ninevitably.\n\n'Lastly, to think of a thing as being in any way other than what it is,\nis not only not knowledge, but it is false opinion widely different from\nthe truth of knowledge. Consequently, if anything is about to be, and\nyet its occurrence is not certain and necessary, how can anyone foreknow\nthat it will occur? For just as knowledge itself is free from all\nadmixture of falsity, so any conception drawn from knowledge cannot be\nother than as it is conceived. For this, indeed, is the cause why\nknowledge is free from falsehood, because of necessity each thing must\ncorrespond exactly with the knowledge which grasps its nature. In what\nway, then, are we to suppose that God foreknows these uncertainties as\nabout to come to pass? For if He thinks of events which possibly may not\nhappen at all as inevitably destined to come to pass, He is deceived;\nand this it is not only impious to believe, but even so much as to\nexpress in words. If, on the other hand, He sees them in the future as\nthey are in such a sense as to know that they may equally come to pass\nor not, what sort of foreknowledge is this which comprehends nothing\ncertain nor fixed? What better is this than the absurd vaticination of\nTeiresias?\n\n      '\"Whate'er I say\n    Shall either come to pass--or not.\"\n\nIn that case, too, in what would Divine providence surpass human opinion\nif it holds for uncertain things the occurrence of which is uncertain,\neven as men do? But if at that perfectly sure Fountain-head of all\nthings no shadow of uncertainty can possibly be found, then the\noccurrence of those things which He has surely foreknown as coming is\ncertain. Wherefore there can be no freedom in human actions and designs;\nbut the Divine mind, which foresees all things without possibility of\nmistake, ties and binds them down to one only issue. But this admission\nonce made, what an upset of human affairs manifestly ensues! Vainly are\nrewards and punishments proposed for the good and bad, since no free and\nvoluntary motion of the will has deserved either one or the other; nay,\nthe punishment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous, which is\nnow esteemed the perfection of justice, will seem the most flagrant\ninjustice, since men are determined either way not by their own proper\nvolition, but by the necessity of what must surely be. And therefore\nneither virtue nor vice is anything, but rather good and ill desert are\nconfounded together without distinction. Moreover, seeing that the whole\ncourse of events is deduced from providence, and nothing is left free to\nhuman design, it comes to pass that our vices also are referred to the\nAuthor of all good--a thought than which none more abominable can\npossibly be conceived. Again, no ground is left for hope or prayer,\nsince how can we hope for blessings, or pray for mercy, when every\nobject of desire depends upon the links of an unalterable chain of\ncausation? Gone, then, is the one means of intercourse between God and\nman--the communion of hope and prayer--if it be true that we ever earn\nthe inestimable recompense of the Divine favour at the price of a due\nhumility; for this is the one way whereby men seem able to hold\ncommunion with God, and are joined to that unapproachable light by the\nvery act of supplication, even before they obtain their petitions. Then,\nsince these things can scarcely be believed to have any efficacy, if the\nnecessity of future events be admitted, what means will there be whereby\nwe may be brought near and cleave to Him who is the supreme Head of all?\nWherefore it needs must be that the human race, even as thou didst\nerstwhile declare in song, parted and dissevered from its Source, should\nfall to ruin.'\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[P] _I.e._, the necessity of the truth of the statement from the fact.\n\n\n\nSONG III. TRUTH'S PARADOXES.\n\n\n\n\n    Why does a strange discordance break\n      The ordered scheme's fair harmony?\n    Hath God decreed 'twixt truth and truth\n      There may such lasting warfare be,\n    That truths, each severally plain,\n    We strive to reconcile in vain?\n\n    Or is the discord not in truth,\n      Since truth is self consistent ever?\n    But, close in fleshly wrappings held,\n      The blinded mind of man can never\n    Discern--so faint her taper shines--\n    The subtle chain that all combines?\n\n    Ah! then why burns man's restless mind\n      Truth's hidden portals to unclose?\n    Knows he already what he seeks?\n      Why toil to seek it, if he knows?\n    Yet, haply if he knoweth not,\n    Why blindly seek he knows not what?[Q]\n\n\n    Who for a good he knows not sighs?\n      Who can an unknown end pursue?\n    How find? How e'en when haply found\n      Hail that strange form he never knew?\n    Or is it that man's inmost soul\n    Once knew each part and knew the whole?\n\n    Now, though by fleshly vapours dimmed,\n      Not all forgot her visions past;\n    For while the several parts are lost,\n      To the one whole she cleaveth fast;\n    Whence he who yearns the truth to find\n    Is neither sound of sight nor blind.\n\n    For neither does he know in full,\n      Nor is he reft of knowledge quite;\n    But, holding still to what is left,\n      He gropes in the uncertain light,\n    And by the part that still survives\n    To win back all he bravely strives.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Q] Compare Plato, 'Meno,' 80; Jowett, vol. ii., pp. 39, 40.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThen said she: 'This debate about providence is an old one, and is\nvigorously discussed by Cicero in his \"Divination\"; thou also hast long\nand earnestly pondered the problem, yet no one has had diligence and\nperseverance enough to find a solution. And the reason of this obscurity\nis that the movement of human reasoning cannot cope with the simplicity\nof the Divine foreknowledge; for if a conception of its nature could in\nany wise be framed, no shadow of uncertainty would remain. With a view\nof making this at last clear and plain, I will begin by considering the\narguments by which thou art swayed. First, I inquire into the reasons\nwhy thou art dissatisfied with the solution proposed, which is to the\neffect that, seeing the fact of foreknowledge is not thought the cause\nof the necessity of future events, foreknowledge is not to be deemed any\nhindrance to the freedom of the will. Now, surely the sole ground on\nwhich thou arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are\nforeknown cannot fail to come to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to\nacknowledge just now, the fact of foreknowledge imposes no necessity on\nthings future, what reason is there for supposing the results of\nvoluntary action constrained to a fixed issue? Suppose, for the sake of\nargument, and to see what follows, we assume that there is no\nforeknowledge. Are willed actions, then, tied down to any necessity in\n_this_ case?'\n\n'Certainly not.'\n\n'Let us assume foreknowledge again, but without its involving any actual\nnecessity; the freedom of the will, I imagine, will remain in complete\nintegrity. But thou wilt say that, even although the foreknowledge is\nnot the necessity of the future event's occurrence, yet it is a sign\nthat it will necessarily happen. Granted; but in this case it is plain\nthat, even if there had been no foreknowledge, the issues would have\nbeen inevitably certain. For a sign only indicates something which is,\ndoes not bring to pass that of which it is the sign. We require to show\nbeforehand that all things, without exception, happen of necessity in\norder that a preconception may be a sign of this necessity. Otherwise,\nif there is no such universal necessity, neither can any preconception\nbe a sign of a necessity which exists not. Manifestly, too, a proof\nestablished on firm grounds of reason must be drawn not from signs and\nloose general arguments, but from suitable and necessary causes. But how\ncan it be that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why,\nthis is to suppose us to believe that the events which providence\nforesees to be coming were not about to happen, instead of our supposing\nthat, although they should come to pass, yet there was no necessity\ninvolved in their own nature compelling their occurrence. Take an\nillustration that will help to convey my meaning. There are many things\nwhich we see taking place before our eyes--the movements of charioteers,\nfor instance, in guiding and turning their cars, and so on. Now, is any\none of these movements compelled by any necessity?'\n\n'No; certainly not. There would be no efficacy in skill if all motions\ntook place perforce.'\n\n'Then, things which in taking place are free from any necessity as to\ntheir being in the present must also, before they take place, be about\nto happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will come\nto pass, the occurrence of which is perfectly free from necessity. At\nall events, I imagine that no one will deny that things now taking place\nwere about to come to pass before they were actually happening. Such\nthings, however much foreknown, are in their occurrence _free_. For even\nas knowledge of things present imports no necessity into things that are\ntaking place, so foreknowledge of the future imports none into things\nthat are about to come. But this, thou wilt say, is the very point in\ndispute--whether any foreknowing is possible of things whose occurrence\nis not necessary. For here there seems to thee a contradiction, and, if\nthey are foreseen, their necessity follows; whereas if there is no\nnecessity, they can by no means be foreknown; and thou thinkest that\nnothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain, but if things\nwhose occurrence is uncertain are foreknown as certain, this is the very\nmist of opinion, not the truth of knowledge. For to think of things\notherwise than as they are, thou believest to be incompatible with the\nsoundness of knowledge.\n\n'Now, the cause of the mistake is this--that men think that all\nknowledge is cognized purely by the nature and efficacy of the thing\nknown. Whereas the case is the very reverse: all that is known is\ngrasped not conformably to its own efficacy, but rather conformably to\nthe faculty of the knower. An example will make this clear: the\nroundness of a body is recognised in one way by sight, in another by\ntouch. Sight looks upon it from a distance as a whole by a simultaneous\nreflection of rays; touch grasps the roundness piecemeal, by contact and\nattachment to the surface, and by actual movement round the periphery\nitself. Man himself, likewise, is viewed in one way by Sense, in another\nby Imagination, in another way, again, by Thought, in another by pure\nIntelligence. Sense judges figure clothed in material substance,\nImagination figure alone without matter. Thought transcends this again,\nand by its contemplation of universals considers the type itself which\nis contained in the individual. The eye of Intelligence is yet more\nexalted; for overpassing the sphere of the universal, it will behold\nabsolute form itself by the pure force of the mind's vision. Wherein the\nmain point to be considered is this: the higher faculty of comprehension\nembraces the lower, while the lower cannot rise to the higher. For Sense\nhas no efficacy beyond matter, nor can Imagination behold universal\nideas, nor Thought embrace pure form; but Intelligence, looking down, as\nit were, from its higher standpoint in its intuition of form,\ndiscriminates also the several elements which underlie it; but it\ncomprehends them in the same way as it comprehends that form itself,\nwhich could be cognized by no other than itself. For it cognizes the\nuniversal of Thought, the figure of Imagination, and the matter of\nSense, without employing Thought, Imagination, or Sense, but surveying\nall things, so to speak, under the aspect of pure form by a single flash\nof intuition. Thought also, in considering the universal, embraces\nimages and sense-impressions without resorting to Imagination or Sense.\nFor it is Thought which has thus defined the universal from its\nconceptual point of view: \"Man is a two-legged animal endowed with\nreason.\" This is indeed a universal notion, yet no one is ignorant that\nthe _thing_ is imaginable and presentable to Sense, because Thought\nconsiders it not by Imagination or Sense, but by means of rational\nconception. Imagination, too, though its faculty of viewing and forming\nrepresentations is founded upon the senses, nevertheless surveys\nsense-impressions without calling in Sense, not in the way of\nSense-perception, but of Imagination. See'st thou, then, how all things\nin cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the things\nwhich they cognize? Nor is this strange; for since every judgment is the\nact of the judge, it is necessary that each should accomplish its task\nby its own, not by another's power.'\n\n\n\nSONG IV. A PSYCHOLOGICAL FALLACY.\n\n[R]\n\n\n    From the Porch's murky depths\n      Comes a doctrine sage,\n    That doth liken living mind\n      To a written page;\n    Since all knowledge comes through\n      Sense,\n    Graven by Experience.\n\n    'As,' say they, 'the pen its marks\n      Curiously doth trace\n    On the smooth unsullied white\n      Of the paper's face,\n    So do outer things impress\n    Images on consciousness.'\n\n    But if verily the mind\n      Thus all passive lies;\n    If no living power within\n      Its own force supplies;\n    If it but reflect again,\n    Like a glass, things false and vain--\n\n\n    Whence the wondrous faculty\n      That perceives and knows,\n    That in one fair ordered scheme\n      Doth the world dispose;\n    Grasps each whole that Sense presents,\n    Or breaks into elements?\n\n    So divides and recombines,\n      And in changeful wise\n    Now to low descends, and now\n      To the height doth rise;\n    Last in inward swift review\n    Strictly sifts the false and true?\n\n    Of these ample potencies\n      Fitter cause, I ween,\n    Were Mind's self than marks impressed\n      By the outer scene.\n    Yet the body through the sense\n    Stirs the soul's intelligence.\n\n    When light flashes on the eye,\n      Or sound strikes the ear,\n    Mind aroused to due response\n      Makes the message clear;\n    And the dumb external signs\n    With the hidden forms combines.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[R] A criticism of the doctrine of the mind as a blank sheet of paper on\nwhich experience writes, as held by the Stoics in anticipation of Locke.\nSee Zeller, 'Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics,' Reichel's translation,\np. 76.\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\n'Now, although in the case of bodies endowed with sentiency the\nqualities of external objects affect the sense-organs, and the activity\nof mind is preceded by a bodily affection which calls forth the mind's\naction upon itself, and stimulates the forms till that moment lying\ninactive within, yet, I say, if in these bodies endowed with sentiency\nthe mind is not inscribed by mere passive affection, but of its own\nefficacy discriminates the impressions furnished to the body, how much\nmore do intelligences free from all bodily affections employ in their\ndiscrimination their own mental activities instead of conforming to\nexternal objects? So on these principles various modes of cognition\nbelong to distinct and different substances. For to creatures void of\nmotive power--shell-fish and other such creatures which cling to rocks\nand grow there--belongs Sense alone, void of all other modes of gaining\nknowledge; to beasts endowed with movement, in whom some capacity of\nseeking and shunning seems to have arisen, Imagination also. Thought\npertains only to the human race, as Intelligence to Divinity alone;\nhence it follows that that form of knowledge exceeds the rest which of\nits own nature cognizes not only its proper object, but the objects of\nthe other forms of knowledge also. But what if Sense and Imagination\nwere to gainsay Thought, and declare that universal which Thought deems\nitself to behold to be nothing? For the object of Sense and Imagination\ncannot be universal; so that either the judgment of Reason is true and\nthere is no sense-object, or, since they know full well that many\nobjects are presented to Sense and Imagination, the conception of\nReason, which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular\nas if it were a something \"universal,\" is empty of content. Suppose,\nfurther, that Reason maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate\nthe object of both Sense and Imagination under the form of\nuniversality, while Sense and Imagination cannot aspire to the\nknowledge of the universal, since their cognizance cannot go beyond\nbodily figures, and that in the cognition of reality we ought rather to\ntrust the stronger and more perfect faculty of judgment. In a dispute of\nthis sort, should not we, in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as\nwell as of imagining and perceiving, espouse the cause of Reason?\n\n'In like manner is it that human reason thinks that Divine Intelligence\ncannot see the future except after the fashion in which its own\nknowledge is obtained. For thy contention is, if events do not appear to\ninvolve certain and necessary issues, they cannot be foreseen as\ncertainly about to come to pass. There is, then, no foreknowledge of\nsuch events; or, if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there\nis, there can be nothing which does not happen of necessity. If,\nhowever, we could have some part in the judgment of the Divine mind,\neven as we participate in Reason, we should think it perfectly just that\nhuman Reason should submit itself to the Divine mind, no less than we\njudged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to Reason. Wherefore\nlet us soar, if we can, to the heights of that Supreme Intelligence; for\nthere Reason will see what in itself it cannot look upon; and that is in\nwhat way things whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a\nsure and definite foreknowledge; and that this foreknowledge is not\nconjecture, but rather knowledge in its supreme simplicity, free of all\nlimits and restrictions.'\n\n\n\nSONG V. THE UPWARD LOOK.\n\n\n    In what divers shapes and fashions do the creatures great and small\n    Over wide earth's teeming surface skim, or scud, or walk, or crawl!\n    Some with elongated body sweep the ground, and, as they move,\n    Trail perforce with writhing belly in the dust a sinuous groove;\n    Some, on light wing upward soaring, swiftly do the winds divide,\n    And through heaven's ample spaces in free motion smoothly glide;\n    These earth's solid surface pressing, with firm paces onward rove,\n    Ranging through the verdant meadows, crouching in the woodland grove.\n    Great and wondrous is their variance! Yet in all the head low-bent\n    Dulls the soul and blunts the senses, though their forms be different.\n    Man alone, erect, aspiring, lifts his forehead to the skies,\n    And in upright posture steadfast seems earth's baseness to despise.\n    If with earth not all besotted, to this parable give ear,\n    Thou whose gaze is fixed on heaven, who thy face on high dost rear:\n    Lift thy soul, too, heavenward; haply lest it stain its heavenly worth,\n    And thine eyes alone look upward, while thy mind cleaves to the earth!\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\n'Since, then, as we lately proved, everything that is known is cognized\nnot in accordance with its own nature, but in accordance with the nature\nof the faculty that comprehends it, let us now contemplate, as far as\nlawful, the character of the Divine essence, that we may be able to\nunderstand also the nature of its knowledge.\n\n'God is eternal; in this judgment all rational beings agree. Let us,\nthen, consider what eternity is. For this word carries with it a\nrevelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine knowledge. Now,\neternity is the possession of endless life whole and perfect at a single\nmoment. What this is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison\nwith things temporal. For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding\nfrom the past to the future, and there is nothing set in time which can\nembrace the whole space of its life together. To-morrow's state it\ngrasps not yet, while it has already lost yesterday's; nay, even in the\nlife of to-day ye live no longer than one brief transitory moment.\nWhatever, therefore, is subject to the condition of time, although, as\nAristotle deemed of the world, it never have either beginning or end,\nand its life be stretched to the whole extent of time's infinity, it yet\nis not such as rightly to be thought eternal. For it does not include\nand embrace the whole space of infinite life at once, but has no present\nhold on things to come, not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which\nincludes and possesses the whole fulness of unending life at once, from\nwhich nothing future is absent, from which nothing past has escaped,\nthis is rightly called eternal; this must of necessity be ever present\nto itself in full self-possession, and hold the infinity of movable time\nin an abiding present. Wherefore they deem not rightly who imagine that\non Plato's principles the created world is made co-eternal with the\nCreator, because they are told that he believed the world to have had\nno beginning in time,[S] and to be destined never to come to an end. For\nit is one thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged, which was what\nPlato ascribed to the world, another for the whole of an endless life to\nbe embraced in the present, which is manifestly a property peculiar to\nthe Divine mind. Nor need God appear earlier in mere duration of time to\ncreated things, but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature.\nFor the infinite progression of things in time copies this immediate\nexistence in the present of the changeless life, and when it cannot\nsucceed in equalling it, declines from movelessness into motion, and\nfalls away from the simplicity of a perpetual present to the infinite\nduration of the future and the past; and since it cannot possess the\nwhole fulness of its life together, for the very reason that in a manner\nit never ceases to be, it seems, up to a certain point, to rival that\nwhich it cannot complete and express by attaching itself indifferently\nto any present moment of time, however swift and brief; and since this\nbears some resemblance to that ever-abiding present, it bestows on\neverything to which it is assigned the semblance of existence. But since\nit cannot abide, it hurries along the infinite path of time, and the\nresult has been that it continues by ceaseless movement the life the\ncompleteness of which it could not embrace while it stood still. So, if\nwe are minded to give things their right names, we shall follow Plato in\nsaying that God indeed is eternal, but the world everlasting.\n\n'Since, then, every mode of judgment comprehends its objects conformably\nto its own nature, and since God abides for ever in an eternal present,\nHis knowledge, also transcending all movement of time, dwells in the\nsimplicity of its own changeless present, and, embracing the whole\ninfinite sweep of the past and of the future, contemplates all that\nfalls within its simple cognition as if it were now taking place. And\ntherefore, if thou wilt carefully consider that immediate presentment\nwhereby it discriminates all things, thou wilt more rightly deem it not\nforeknowledge as of something future, but knowledge of a moment that\nnever passes. For this cause the name chosen to describe it is not\nprevision, but providence, because, since utterly removed in nature from\nthings mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all things as from some\nlofty height. Why, then, dost thou insist that the things which are\nsurveyed by the Divine eye are involved in necessity, whereas clearly\nmen impose no necessity on things which they see? Does the act of vision\nadd any necessity to the things which thou seest before thy eyes?'\n\n'Assuredly not.'\n\n'And yet, if we may without unfitness compare God's present and man's,\njust as ye see certain things in this your temporary present, so does He\nsee all things in His eternal present. Wherefore this Divine\nanticipation changes not the natures and properties of things, and it\nbeholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter come to\npass in time. Nor does it confound things in its judgment, but in the\none mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what\nwithout necessity. For even as ye, when at one and the same time ye see\na man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky, distinguish\nbetween the two, though one glance embraces both, and judge the former\nvoluntary, the latter necessary action: so also the Divine vision in its\nuniversal range of view does in no wise confuse the characters of the\nthings which are present to its regard, though future in respect of\ntime. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will come\ninto existence, and yet is perfectly aware that this is unbound by any\nnecessity, its apprehension is not opinion, but rather knowledge based\non truth. And if to this thou sayest that what God sees to be about to\ncome to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to\ncome to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word\nnecessity, I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth,\nbut one which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the\nDivine his special study. For my answer would be that the same future\nevent is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge, but when\nconsidered in its own nature it seems absolutely free and unfettered.\nSo, then, there are two necessities--one simple, as that men are\nnecessarily mortal; the other conditioned, as that, if you know that\nsomeone is walking, he must necessarily be walking. For that which is\nknown cannot indeed be otherwise than as it is known to be, and yet this\nfact by no means carries with it that other simple necessity. For the\nformer necessity is not imposed by the thing's own proper nature, but by\nthe addition of a condition. No necessity compels one who is voluntarily\nwalking to go forward, although it is necessary for him to go forward at\nthe moment of walking. In the same way, then, if Providence sees\nanything as present, that must necessarily be, though it is bound by no\nnecessity of nature. Now, God views as present those coming events which\nhappen of free will. These, accordingly, from the standpoint of the\nDivine vision are made necessary conditionally on the Divine\ncognizance; viewed, however, in themselves, they desist not from the\nabsolute freedom naturally theirs. Accordingly, without doubt, all\nthings will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of\nthese certain proceed of free will; and though these happen, yet by the\nfact of their existence they do not lose their proper nature, in virtue\nof which before they happened it was really possible that they might not\nhave come to pass.\n\n'What difference, then, does the denial of necessity make, since,\nthrough their being conditioned by Divine knowledge, they come to pass\nas if they were in all respects under the compulsion of necessity? This\ndifference, surely, which we saw in the case of the instances I formerly\ntook, the sun's rising and the man's walking; which at the moment of\ntheir occurrence could not but be taking place, and yet one of them\nbefore it took place was necessarily obliged to be, while the other was\nnot so at all. So likewise the things which to God are present without\ndoubt exist, but some of them come from the necessity of things, others\nfrom the power of the agent. Quite rightly, then, have we said that\nthese things are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine\nknowledge; but if they are considered in themselves, they are free from\nthe bonds of necessity, even as everything which is accessible to sense,\nregarded from the standpoint of Thought, is universal, but viewed in its\nown nature particular. \"But,\" thou wilt say, \"if it is in my power to\nchange my purpose, I shall make void providence, since I shall perchance\nchange something which comes within its foreknowledge.\" My answer is:\nThou canst indeed turn aside thy purpose; but since the truth of\nprovidence is ever at hand to see that thou canst, and whether thou\ndost, and whither thou turnest thyself, thou canst not avoid the Divine\nforeknowledge, even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present\nspectator, although of thy free will thou turn thyself to various\nactions. Wilt thou, then, say: \"Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at\nmy discretion, so that, when I will this or that, providence changes its\nknowledge correspondingly?\"\n\n'Surely not.'\n\n'True, for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming, and\ntransforms and reduces it to the form of its own present knowledge, and\nvaries not, as thou deemest, in its foreknowledge, alternating to this\nor that, but in a single flash it forestalls and includes thy mutations\nwithout altering. And this ever-present comprehension and survey of all\nthings God has received, not from the issue of future events, but from\nthe simplicity of His own nature. Hereby also is resolved the objection\nwhich a little while ago gave thee offence--that our doings in the\nfuture were spoken of as if supplying the cause of God's knowledge. For\nthis faculty of knowledge, embracing all things in its immediate\ncognizance, has itself fixed the bounds of all things, yet itself owes\nnothing to what comes after.\n\n'And all this being so, the freedom of man's will stands unshaken, and\nlaws are not unrighteous, since their rewards and punishments are held\nforth to wills unbound by any necessity. God, who foreknoweth all\nthings, still looks down from above, and the ever-present eternity of\nHis vision concurs with the future character of all our acts, and\ndispenseth to the good rewards, to the bad punishments. Our hopes and\nprayers also are not fixed on God in vain, and when they are rightly\ndirected cannot fail of effect. Therefore, withstand vice, practise\nvirtue, lift up your souls to right hopes, offer humble prayers to\nHeaven. Great is the necessity of righteousness laid upon you if ye will\nnot hide it from yourselves, seeing that all your actions are done\nbefore the eyes of a Judge who seeth all things.'\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[S] Plato expressly states the opposite in the 'Timaeus' (28B), though\npossibly there the account of the beginning of the world in time is to\nbe understood figuratively, not literally.

Whether or not these causes appear to have relation to each other, they are nevertheless governed by Providence. Boethius then asks how can there be free will in this close-knit chain of events. To this Philosophy asserts that there must indeed be free will, because no rational nature could exist without it. Judgment and the ability to choose are inherent in a rational nature. The more rational a person is, and the more they choose virtue and the pursuit of true happiness in God, the freer that person is. If a person is wicked or enslaved to vice, that person becomes progressively less and less free, and controlled by vice and error. Here Philosophy returns to the subject of the mind of God, and his one act of knowing everything that has occurred, past and present. Just because God knows what a person with free will is going to choose, doesn't mean that he directed it. God knows all things before they happen, but he doesn't interfere with the free will of human beings. Boethius protests, saying that these two things are oppositional. How can God know about something before it happens, but therefore not control or direct the free choices of human beings? Philosophy enters into another long explanation of the mind of God. God does not \"know\" the world in the same way that human beings do. God is outside of time, so he doesn't view the world in a progression of events. For God no future event is uncertain, no past event forgotten. God knows the world in one single act, which includes knowledge of all the choices of all human beings from the beginning of the world to the end. Therefore he doesn't influence these choices, but he knew of them as part of the whole foreknowledge of the world perceived in one single instance. This raises the problem of the efficacy of prayer, but Philosophy counsels that prayer is the one way of communicating with God. Even if the future is already ordained we still must strive to join ourselves with our Creator through prayer. We are temporal creatures, and we can only understand things in a temporal way. This doesn't mean we can't participate in eternity by striving to be one with God. Philosophy says that it is still important to strive for virtue, for God is always watching and judging. That the world has already happened for God is a mystery to us, but we are temporal and cannot hope to fully understand eternity.","summary_analysis":"This last book of The Consolation of Philosophy raises the most questions of any of the books of The Consolation of Philosophy.  The idea of foreknowledge and Providence have been debated for centuries.  This argument was even referred to in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.  There is no reason to believe that this debate will cease anytime soon. What is at issue is a central philosophical question of whether or not the world is predetermined or subject to chance.  Philosophy walks a middle ground here, saying that God knows all things since he perceives the world in one instance of knowing, but in that instance of knowing he didn't force the choices of all the people in the world.  He just knows how it happened, all at once. Since there is no logical way to support this argument, the idea of the single instant of knowing must be taken as given.  Boethius has set up the arguments in the previous books so that this is the only possible solution.  He gives credit to Aristotle for this idea, but the preceding arguments and proofs are all his own.  Providence is the ordering of all things by God, and he had a plan for his world, but he didn't necessarily influence the choices of the people in it.  Fate is simply the events that must occur because, for God, the whole world including all future people and events has already happened.  Philosophy is right to call it a mystery. Free will is very important in this Book because it is a necessary component of Catholic faith.  If there were no free will there would be no accountability for sin on earth, and sin is held accountable and confession, and possibly punishment, are necessary for redemption.  Boethius had to reconcile the idea of free will to the idea of Providence in order to remain orthodox. The passages about the wicked being less free than the virtuous are also a part of the free will argument.  If the wicked have free will, then can their choices could be considered as valid as the choices the virtuous make?  Not so, says Philosophy, for their choices come to be controlled by their vices, not by their sound judgment.  The more evil a human being becomes, the less free and less human he or she becomes. The subject of prayer comes up at the end of this book.  If God knows all things, then what is the use of praying to him?  Philosophy admonishes Boethius that he should not cut off the one communication conduit he has with God.  Prayer is a path to virtue, and the book ends with Philosophy advising Boethius to cultivate virtue as much as possible since God sees and is the judge of all things. The difficulties with this ordering of the world are plain to a modern reader.  For example, even if God does know everything that happens on earth in one instant, he, in his omniscience, can still intervene and could guide the evil towards good if he chose.  This would destroy free will, but would it also take away from the idea that God is also all good?  If he could prevent someone from turning down the path of evil, why doesn't he? Free will must be retained, in order to make human beings accountable for their actions and not merely puppets of God.  Also, the lack of substance of evil  means that God isn't allowing evil to happen, because evil doesn't really exist. Much depends on faith in these five Books of Boethius, but many logical arguments are contained in it, too.  Boethius seems to strain for orthodoxy at times, but that doesn't make the philosophy any less brilliant, or the \"consolation\" any less real.  Again, a modern reader must never forget the context of Boethius' work: he is in a desperate position, striving for a dollop of happiness amidst misery.  If his work contains logical fallacies and shortcomings, so be it - the object is consolation, and that object, it seems, is achieved.","summary_length":505.0,"analysis_length":700.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["book iv","book iv"],"previous chapter":["Book IV examines the problem of evil's existence. Boethius has listened to and agreed with all of the arguments Philosophy has so far presented. But if God is perfect in his goodness, and is the unity of all things rules the world, how is it that evil is allowed to exist and is not always punished? In addition, where wickedness flourishes, virtue is often downtrodden and even stamped out. If God is omniscient and omnipotent and beneficent how can this evil continue in His world? Lady Philosophy reminds Boethius of his catechism - that God has said no evil will go unpunished, no virtue will be forgotten. Philosophy also asserts that the wicked are weak and have no power, and the virtuous are strong and powerful. All people strive to true happiness; the wicked cannot possibly attain it, and the virtuous can attain it. The evil people of the world seek happiness in misguided ways, and they will never attain their goal. Evil people are excluded from attaining the supreme good of perfect happiness, and therefore they are excluded from all that really exists. Since they cannot possibly attain the only thing of value any earthly power they have is not actually power at all. Evil people, Philosophy says, cease to exist. The wicked lose power and strength by striving for things that do not matter. They also lose their humanity, and become like the animals they represent by their various desires . Boethius agrees, but he laments that the wicked harm the virtuous and are not punished. Wickedness, like virtue, Philosophy assures Boethius, is its own reward. The wicked, by the fact of their very wickedness, are rewarded by their lack of existence and their descent into bestiality. The are, by their own actions rather than by any outside punishment, denied happiness. If they are punished, the evil people of the world are given a good, for they have a chance at redeeming themselves and changing their ways. When the evil people of the world escape punishment, their capacity and likelihood for more wickedness increases. Boethius finds this difficult, and protests. He can't abide that the good must suffer the earthly punishments that the evil, who deserve them, inflict upon them. This is acceptable in a world where nothing is determinate, but our world, he says, is ruled by God. How can God in his omnipotence allow this? The following argument for the foreknowledge of God is famous and somewhat difficult. Philosophy agrees that this is indeed a mystery, and no human being can hope to understand it fully. All events on Earth are happening in the unchanging mind of God, for whom there is no past, present or future. Since we are temporal beings, we cannot understand how everything that has ever happened or will happen is happening for God simultaneously, but every occurrence is contained within His mind. The government of all changeable things is called Providence. When this is applied in the temporal realm, it is called by the old pagan name of Fate. In short, Providence represents the foreknowledge of God of all things, and controls of the nature of all things. The actual connection of events which occur on Earth is Fate. Providence is the divine reason by which the world is ordered. Fate is the same reason when applied the temporal world. Because we on earth cannot understand Providence, Fate sometimes seems unordered and cruel. Because of this, anything that happens to you, good fortune or bad, is good, because if your fortune is bad it is an instruction toward virtue. This is, in short, the best of all possible worlds, for evil doesn't actually have any substance or power, and all the events of the world have been planned by Providence.","of Parts I and II       Since the existence of evil was the stumbling block for Boethius at the end of the last book, it is examined more closely now. Boethius comments that he likes the sweet songs of Philosophy, but he has not yet forgotten his sorrow. He challenges her that even though good ultimately rules the world, evil still exists and goes unpunished. What is worse, when wickedness is in charge, it not only does not reward the good, it actively punishes the good. It is a mystery how this can happen in a world ruled by an omnipotent God. Philosophy corrects his ideas, saying that the good are always strong, and the wicked always weak. Sin is always punished and virtue always rewarded. She tells him she will show him the path to bring him home, and she will give his mind wings. Then she recites a poem about the ascent of the soul to God where the soul says, \"I remember\" . Boethius says he is anxious for her to keep her promise to give his mind wings. All human activity depends on will and power, she says. The instinctive direction of the human will is towards happiness, which is the same as the good. Both good men and bad men strive for the same thing--the good. The good men become good because they are already by nature virtuous. If the bad men obtain the good, they are no longer bad. The power of good men is therefore stronger in the pursuit of good, and the bad are weaker and have to put forth more effort. Because they do not know how to gain the good, the bad are ignorant and weak through lack of self-control. If the ignorant turn to vice on purpose, they not only cease to be powerful, they cease to exist at all, because existence and life derive from the good. Whatever \"power\" the evil have, therefore, comes from weakness, not strength. Since God has the supreme power, and that supreme power is goodness, evil cannot be counted as a form of power. The wise achieve their desire, while the wicked only get pleasure without the good."],"next summary id":"book v","next chapter":"Now Boethius has decided that Philosophy's arguments must be true, but he still questions, \"What are we to make of chance?\" Chance, or random occurrence without any sequence of causes, cannot exist in the mind of God as Philosophy has described it. \"If God imposes order on things,\" Boethius says to Philosophy, \"then there is no opportunity for random events.\" Philosophy answers that any chance event that occurs had its own set of hidden causes, whether or not they are perceived by human beings.

Humans are more free when they participate in the contemplation of God, and less free when they act out of bodily desires. If they are wicked, they are mere slaves to their own destructive will. These choices are all visible to the eye of Providence, which predestines award or punishment according to merit.\", \"analysis\": \"Commentary on Parts I and II       Providence is the all-knowing vision of God in eternity, who sees past, present, and future at once. Humans have free will, and God, watching the choice from on high, is ready with the \\\"predestined\\\" reward or punishment. The person's fate is not actually predetermined by God but given by God as a natural consequence of the person's free will. Philosophy says there is no chance or accident. Whether or not we can see all the causes, everything works out in an orderly and just fashion. Summary of Parts III and IV       Boethius is puzzled how there can be freedom of will if God already knows what we will do. If it is known, isn't it already decided then? It would not then be possible to change one's mind. Philosophy says that if something is to happen, it cannot be concealed from Providence. People wonder if foreknowledge of the future causes the future? How can God foreknow events that are still uncertain and being decided by an individual? If Providence is the same as certainty about the future, how meaningful is prayer, hope, and the relationship between God and human? Philosophy says this is an old debate, but human reasoning cannot understand \\\"the immediacy of divine foreknowledge\\\" . Free will is not hindered by God's foreknowledge, which is merely knowledge of what is about to happen. One can know something is going on without having any influence on it. It does not make what is happening inevitable. Seeing something and necessity are not the same thing. Different creatures have different abilities to know. Sense perception is the lowest faculty, common with animals. They only know things through their bodily senses. Imagination is a higher power because it does not depend on physical objects. Reason is higher still because it can understand the universal law by inference. The highest form of knowing is pure intelligence itself, and this intelligence sees the Idea or \\\"simple form\\\" in the mind of God . This highest knowing, only available to God, sees \\\"by a single glance of the mind\\\" . The lower kind of knowing cannot grasp the higher knowing. Commentary on Parts III and IV       Philosophy gives a very important answer to Boethius's question about free will and Providence. It is a hotly debated question in philosophy about how God can know the future if humans have free will. What if they have not decided yet? There are those who believe that predestination is what is really going on, and humans only think they have free will. If God already knows, for instance, which souls will be saved, why should humans even bother trying to be good? It has been predetermined, like loaded dice. Philosophy tells Boethius it may seem like a paradox, but God's foreknowledge of how things will turn out does not interfere with human free will. She gives the answer that there are different forms of knowledge, and someone who has a lower ability cannot comprehend a higher ability. Animals, for instance, have sense perception, or knowing by the senses. Humans can go farther by imagining things that are not present. They can also use the mind to reason about the invisible laws of nature from inference. But an even higher knowledge like God's comes from pure intelligence, which knows everything at once without regard to time. Humans know in sequence, one thing at a time, in terms of past, present, and future, but God can know immediately what is going on everywhere. That does not mean God is interfering with us. Philosophy recites a poem about knowledge, explaining the passive model of the mind taught by the Stoics. Stoicism was a material philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium . Stoics thought the mind merely received sense impressions as on a wax tablet. As a Platonist, Boethius denied this model of knowledge. For him, the mind is spiritual and powerfully active, able to analyze and synthesize and know the truth beyond sense impression. Humans may not know like God knows, but they can participate with God in the divine nature of life through reason. Summary of Parts V and VI       Philosophy continues the topic of different kinds of knowing. Reason belongs only to the human race, just as pure intelligence belongs to divinity. Divine intelligence comprehends the lower kinds of knowing, yet human reason refuses to believe that divine intelligence can see the future in a \\\"boundless immediacy\\\" . Eternity is the \\\"complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of everlasting life\\\"  while those who live in time experience past, present, and future. Humans catch a fleeting and transitory glimpse of life only. To experience the whole of life in the present moment is characteristic of the mind of God. His knowledge transcends change. Commentary on Parts V and VI       The book finishes with this discussion of God's foreknowledge. Philosophy ends her teaching to Boethius in prison with this point in order to give him faith in Providence. Are his suffering and imprisonment simply due to chance or evil? Or can he have faith that God has foreseen all and that even the death of Boethius will be part of the good, of God's providential foresight? God sees what is happening in a never-ending present moment. The divine gaze \\\"looks down on all things without disturbing their nature\\\" . If God is on high witnessing this fate for Boethius, then it is necessary for it to happen, though God is not causing it to happen. God is the \\\"spectator from on high of all things\\\" . Therefore, Philosophy concludes, \\\"Avoid vice . . . cultivate virtue; lift up your mind to the right kind of hope, and put forth humble prayers on high\\\" . She has comforted Boethius with the idea that God is near and part of our human nature. We are always free to be with God and part of the good, no matter what fate we are handed in the world by Fortune. Book V of Parts I and II Boethius tells Philosophy he wants her to go more deeply into the topic of chance. Is there such a thing as random chance ruling our lives? Perhaps that is how he ended up in prison. Philosophy says if you define chance as randomness, there is no such thing. If God is maintaining order, there cannot be something random happening someplace, for \\\"nothing comes out of nothing\\\" . Boethius replies, how about accidents? Philosophy mentions that Aristotle's definition of chance in his Physics is, something done with one purpose, but getting a different result than was intended. Yet, it is not chance, for there are hidden causes. It may be that multiple and conflicting causes are at work, outside of the intention of the doers. If you define chance as an unpredicted or unexpected event, then perhaps you can say yes, though the events are still under the rule of law. Boethius asks if there is such a thing as free will? Philosophy replies that there is freedom for rational creatures. Humans are rational and cannot exist without it. A rational creature must choose, though freedom may not be equal for all, depending on one's clarity. Humans are more free when they participate in the contemplation of God, and less free when they act out of bodily desires. If they are wicked, they are mere slaves to their own destructive will. These choices are all visible to the eye of Providence, which predestines award or punishment according to merit. Commentary on Parts I and II Commentary on Parts I and II Providence is the all-knowing vision of God in eternity, who sees past, present, and future at once. Humans have free will, and God, watching the choice from on high, is ready with the \\\"predestined\\\" reward or punishment. The person's fate is not actually predetermined by God but given by God as a natural consequence of the person's free will. Philosophy says there is no chance or accident. Whether or not we can see all the causes, everything works out in an orderly and just fashion. of Parts III and IV Boethius is puzzled how there can be freedom of will if God already knows what we will do. If it is known, isn't it already decided then? It would not then be possible to change one's mind. Philosophy says that if something is to happen, it cannot be concealed from Providence. People wonder if foreknowledge of the future causes the future? How can God foreknow events that are still uncertain and being decided by an individual? If Providence is the same as certainty about the future, how meaningful is prayer, hope, and the relationship between God and human? Philosophy says this is an old debate, but human reasoning cannot understand \\\"the immediacy of divine foreknowledge\\\" . Free will is not hindered by God's foreknowledge, which is merely knowledge of what is about to happen. One can know something is going on without having any influence on it. It does not make what is happening inevitable. Seeing something and necessity are not the same thing. Different creatures have different abilities to know. Sense perception is the lowest faculty, common with animals. They only know things through their bodily senses. Imagination is a higher power because it does not depend on physical objects. Reason is higher still because it can understand the universal law by inference. The highest form of knowing is pure intelligence itself, and this intelligence sees the Idea or \\\"simple form\\\" in the mind of God . This highest knowing, only available to God, sees \\\"by a single glance of the mind\\\" . The lower kind of knowing cannot grasp the higher knowing. Commentary on Parts III and IV Commentary on Parts III and IV Philosophy gives a very important answer to Boethius's question about free will and Providence. It is a hotly debated question in philosophy about how God can know the future if humans have free will. What if they have not decided yet? There are those who believe that predestination is what is really going on, and humans only think they have free will. If God already knows, for instance, which souls will be saved, why should humans even bother trying to be good? It has been predetermined, like loaded dice. Philosophy tells Boethius it may seem like a paradox, but God's foreknowledge of how things will turn out does not interfere with human free will. She gives the answer that there are different forms of knowledge, and someone who has a lower ability cannot comprehend a higher ability. Animals, for instance, have sense perception, or knowing by the senses. Humans can go farther by imagining things that are not present. They can also use the mind to reason about the invisible laws of nature from inference. But an even higher knowledge like God's comes from pure intelligence, which knows everything at once without regard to time. Humans know in sequence, one thing at a time, in terms of past, present, and future, but God can know immediately what is going on everywhere. That does not mean God is interfering with us. Philosophy recites a poem about knowledge, explaining the passive model of the mind taught by the Stoics. Stoicism was a material philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium . Stoics thought the mind merely received sense impressions as on a wax tablet. As a Platonist, Boethius denied this model of knowledge. For him, the mind is spiritual and powerfully active, able to analyze and synthesize and know the truth beyond sense impression. Humans may not know like God knows, but they can participate with God in the divine nature of life through reason. of Parts V and VI Philosophy continues the topic of different kinds of knowing. Reason belongs only to the human race, just as pure intelligence belongs to divinity. Divine intelligence comprehends the lower kinds of knowing, yet human reason refuses to believe that divine intelligence can see the future in a \\\"boundless immediacy\\\" . Eternity is the \\\"complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of everlasting life\\\" while those who live in time experience past, present, and future. Humans catch a fleeting and transitory glimpse of life only. To experience the whole of life in the present moment is characteristic of the mind of God. His knowledge transcends change. Commentary on Parts V and VI Commentary on Parts V and VI The book finishes with this discussion of God's foreknowledge. Philosophy ends her teaching to Boethius in prison with this point in order to give him faith in Providence. Are his suffering and imprisonment simply due to chance or evil? Or can he have faith that God has foreseen all and that even the death of Boethius will be part of the good, of God's providential foresight? God sees what is happening in a never-ending present moment. The divine gaze \\\"looks down on all things without disturbing their nature\\\" . If God is on high witnessing this fate for Boethius, then it is necessary for it to happen, though God is not causing it to happen. God is the \\\"spectator from on high of all things\\\" . Therefore, Philosophy concludes, \\\"Avoid vice . . . cultivate virtue; lift up your mind to the right kind of hope, and put forth humble prayers on high\\\" . She has comforted Boethius with the idea that God is near and part of our human nature. We are always free to be with God and part of the good, no matter what fate we are handed in the world by Fortune. Novel Author Boethius Novel Author Boethius\"}","chapter":"<CHAPTER>\nBOOK V. I.\n\n\nShe ceased, and was about to pass on in her discourse to the exposition\nof other matters, when I break in and say: 'Excellent is thine\nexhortation, and such as well beseemeth thy high authority; but I am\neven now experiencing one of the many difficulties which, as thou saidst\nbut now, beset the question of providence. I want to know whether thou\ndeemest that there is any such thing as chance at all, and, if so, what\nit is.'\n\nThen she made answer: 'I am anxious to fulfil my promise completely, and\nopen to thee a way of return to thy native land. As for these matters,\nthough very useful to know, they are yet a little removed from the path\nof our design, and I fear lest digressions should fatigue thee, and thou\nshouldst find thyself unequal to completing the direct journey to our\ngoal.'\n\n'Have no fear for that,' said I. 'It is rest to me to learn, where\nlearning brings delight so exquisite, especially when thy argument has\nbeen built up on all sides with undoubted conviction, and no place is\nleft for uncertainty in what follows.'\n\nShe made answer: 'I will accede to thy request;' and forthwith she thus\nbegan: 'If chance be defined as a result produced by random movement\nwithout any link of causal connection, I roundly affirm that there is no\nsuch thing as chance at all, and consider the word to be altogether\nwithout meaning, except as a symbol of the thing designated. What place\ncan be left for random action, when God constraineth all things to\norder? For \"ex nihilo nihil\" is sound doctrine which none of the\nancients gainsaid, although they used it of material substance, not of\nthe efficient principle; this they laid down as a kind of basis for all\ntheir reasonings concerning nature. Now, if a thing arise without\ncauses, it will appear to have arisen from nothing. But if this cannot\nbe, neither is it possible for there to be chance in accordance with the\ndefinition just given.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'is there, then, nothing which can properly be called\nchance or accident, or is there something to which these names are\nappropriate, though its nature is dark to the vulgar?'\n\n'Our good Aristotle,' says she, 'has defined it concisely in his\n\"Physics,\" and closely in accordance with the truth.'\n\n'How, pray?' said I.\n\n'Thus,' says she: 'Whenever something is done for the sake of a\nparticular end, and for certain reasons some other result than that\ndesigned ensues, this is called chance; for instance, if a man is\ndigging the earth for tillage, and finds a mass of buried gold. Now,\nsuch a find is regarded as accidental; yet it is not \"ex nihilo,\" for it\nhas its proper causes, the unforeseen and unexpected concurrence of\nwhich has brought the chance about. For had not the cultivator been\ndigging, had not the man who hid the money buried it in that precise\nspot, the gold would not have been found. These, then, are the reasons\nwhy the find is a chance one, in that it results from causes which met\ntogether and concurred, not from any intention on the part of the\ndiscoverer. Since neither he who buried the gold nor he who worked in\nthe field _intended_ that the money should be found, but, as I said, it\n_happened_ by coincidence that one dug where the other buried the\ntreasure. We may, then, define chance as being an unexpected result\nflowing from a concurrence of causes where the several factors had some\ndefinite end. But the meeting and concurrence of these causes arises\nfrom that inevitable chain of order which, flowing from the\nfountain-head of Providence, disposes all things in their due time and\nplace.'\n\n\n\nSONG I.\n\nCHANCE.\n\n\n    In the rugged Persian highlands,\n      Where the masters of the bow\n    Skill to feign a flight, and, fleeing,\n      Hurl their darts and pierce the foe;\n    There the Tigris and Euphrates\n      At one source[O] their waters blend,\n    Soon to draw apart, and plainward\n      Each its separate way to wend.\n    When once more their waters mingle\n      In a channel deep and wide,\n    All the flotsam comes together\n      That is borne upon the tide:\n    Ships, and trunks of trees, uprooted\n      In the torrent's wild career,\n    Meet, as 'mid the swirling waters\n      Chance their random way may steer.\n    Yet the shelving of the channel\n      And the flowing water's force\n    Guides each movement, and determines\n      Every floating fragment's course.\n    Thus, where'er the drift of hazard\n      Seems most unrestrained to flow,\n    Chance herself is reined and bitted,\n      And the curb of law doth know.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[O] This is not, of course, literally true, though the Tigris and\nEuphrates rise in the same mountain district.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n'I am following needfully,' said I, 'and I agree that it is as thou\nsayest. But in this series of linked causes is there any freedom left to\nour will, or does the chain of fate bind also the very motions of our\nsouls?'\n\n'There is freedom,' said she; 'nor, indeed, can any creature be\nrational, unless he be endowed with free will. For that which hath the\nnatural use of reason has the faculty of discriminative judgment, and of\nitself distinguishes what is to be shunned or desired. Now, everyone\nseeks what he judges desirable, and avoids what he thinks should be\nshunned. Wherefore, beings endowed with reason possess also the faculty\nof free choice and refusal. But I suppose this faculty not equal alike\nin all. The higher Divine essences possess a clear-sighted judgment, an\nuncorrupt will, and an effective power of accomplishing their wishes.\nHuman souls must needs be comparatively free while they abide in the\ncontemplation of the Divine mind, less free when they pass into bodily\nform, and still less, again, when they are enwrapped in earthly members.\nBut when they are given over to vices, and fall from the possession of\ntheir proper reason, then indeed their condition is utter slavery. For\nwhen they let their gaze fall from the light of highest truth to the\nlower world where darkness reigns, soon ignorance blinds their vision;\nthey are disturbed by baneful affections, by yielding and assenting to\nwhich they help to promote the slavery in which they are involved, and\nare in a manner led captive by reason of their very liberty. Yet He who\nseeth all things from eternity beholdeth these things with the eyes of\nHis providence, and assigneth to each what is predestined for it by its\nmerits:\n\n     '\"All things surveying, all things overhearing.'\"\n\n\n\nSONG II.\n\nTHE TRUE SUN.\n\n\n    Homer with mellifluous tongue\n    Phoebus' glorious light hath sung,\n      Hymning high his praise;\n      Yet _his_ feeble rays\n    Ocean's hollows may not brighten,\n    Nor earth's central gloom enlighten.\n\n    But the might of Him, who skilled\n    This great universe to build,\n      Is not thus confined;\n      Not earth's solid rind,\n    Nor night's blackest canopy,\n    Baffle His all-seeing eye.\n\n    All that is, hath been, shall be,\n    In one glance's compass, He\n      Limitless descries;\n      And, save His, no eyes\n    All the world survey--no, none!\n    _Him_, then, truly name the Sun.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThen said I: 'But now I am once more perplexed by a problem yet more\ndifficult.'\n\n'And what is that?' said she; 'yet, in truth, I can guess what it is\nthat troubles you.'\n\n'It seems,' said I, 'too much of a paradox and a contradiction that God\nshould know all things, and yet there should be free will. For if God\nforesees everything, and can in no wise be deceived, that which\nprovidence foresees to be about to happen must necessarily come to pass.\nWherefore, if from eternity He foreknows not only what men will do, but\nalso their designs and purposes, there can be no freedom of the will,\nseeing that nothing can be done, nor can any sort of purpose be\nentertained, save such as a Divine providence, incapable of being\ndeceived, has perceived beforehand. For if the issues can be turned\naside to some other end than that foreseen by providence, there will not\nthen be any sure foreknowledge of the future, but uncertain conjecture\ninstead, and to think this of God I deem impiety.\n\n'Moreover, I do not approve the reasoning by which some think to solve\nthis puzzle. For they say that it is not because God has foreseen the\ncoming of an event that _therefore_ it is sure to come to pass, but,\nconversely, because something is about to come to pass, it cannot be\nhidden from Divine providence; and accordingly the necessity passes to\nthe opposite side, and it is not that what is foreseen must necessarily\ncome to pass, but that what is about to come to pass must necessarily be\nforeseen. But this is just as if the matter in debate were, which is\ncause and which effect--whether foreknowledge of the future cause of the\nnecessity, or the necessity of the future of the foreknowledge. But we\nneed not be at the pains of demonstrating that, whatsoever be the order\nof the causal sequence, the occurrence of things foreseen is necessary,\neven though the foreknowledge of future events does not in itself\nimpose upon them the necessity of their occurrence. For example, if a\nman be seated, the supposition of his being seated is necessarily true;\nand, conversely, if the supposition of his being seated is true, because\nhe is really seated, he must necessarily be sitting. So, in either case,\nthere is some necessity involved--in this latter case, the necessity of\nthe fact; in the former, of the truth of the statement. But in both\ncases the sitter is not therefore seated because the opinion is true,\nbut rather the opinion is true because antecedently he was sitting as a\nmatter of fact. Thus, though the cause of the truth of the opinion comes\nfrom the other side,[P] yet there is a necessity on both sides alike. We\ncan obviously reason similarly in the case of providence and the future.\nEven if future events are foreseen because they are about to happen, and\ndo not come to pass because they are foreseen, still, all the same,\nthere is a necessity, both that they should be foreseen by God as about\nto come to pass, and that when they are foreseen they should happen, and\nthis is sufficient for the destruction of free will. However, it is\npreposterous to speak of the occurrence of events in time as the cause\nof eternal foreknowledge. And yet if we believe that God foresees future\nevents because they are about to come to pass, what is it but to think\nthat the occurrence of events is the cause of His supreme providence?\nFurther, just as when I _know_ that anything is, that thing\n_necessarily_ is, so when I know that anything will be, it will\n_necessarily_ be. It follows, then, that things foreknown come to pass\ninevitably.\n\n'Lastly, to think of a thing as being in any way other than what it is,\nis not only not knowledge, but it is false opinion widely different from\nthe truth of knowledge. Consequently, if anything is about to be, and\nyet its occurrence is not certain and necessary, how can anyone foreknow\nthat it will occur? For just as knowledge itself is free from all\nadmixture of falsity, so any conception drawn from knowledge cannot be\nother than as it is conceived. For this, indeed, is the cause why\nknowledge is free from falsehood, because of necessity each thing must\ncorrespond exactly with the knowledge which grasps its nature. In what\nway, then, are we to suppose that God foreknows these uncertainties as\nabout to come to pass? For if He thinks of events which possibly may not\nhappen at all as inevitably destined to come to pass, He is deceived;\nand this it is not only impious to believe, but even so much as to\nexpress in words. If, on the other hand, He sees them in the future as\nthey are in such a sense as to know that they may equally come to pass\nor not, what sort of foreknowledge is this which comprehends nothing\ncertain nor fixed? What better is this than the absurd vaticination of\nTeiresias?\n\n      '\"Whate'er I say\n    Shall either come to pass--or not.\"\n\nIn that case, too, in what would Divine providence surpass human opinion\nif it holds for uncertain things the occurrence of which is uncertain,\neven as men do? But if at that perfectly sure Fountain-head of all\nthings no shadow of uncertainty can possibly be found, then the\noccurrence of those things which He has surely foreknown as coming is\ncertain. Wherefore there can be no freedom in human actions and designs;\nbut the Divine mind, which foresees all things without possibility of\nmistake, ties and binds them down to one only issue. But this admission\nonce made, what an upset of human affairs manifestly ensues! Vainly are\nrewards and punishments proposed for the good and bad, since no free and\nvoluntary motion of the will has deserved either one or the other; nay,\nthe punishment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous, which is\nnow esteemed the perfection of justice, will seem the most flagrant\ninjustice, since men are determined either way not by their own proper\nvolition, but by the necessity of what must surely be. And therefore\nneither virtue nor vice is anything, but rather good and ill desert are\nconfounded together without distinction. Moreover, seeing that the whole\ncourse of events is deduced from providence, and nothing is left free to\nhuman design, it comes to pass that our vices also are referred to the\nAuthor of all good--a thought than which none more abominable can\npossibly be conceived. Again, no ground is left for hope or prayer,\nsince how can we hope for blessings, or pray for mercy, when every\nobject of desire depends upon the links of an unalterable chain of\ncausation? Gone, then, is the one means of intercourse between God and\nman--the communion of hope and prayer--if it be true that we ever earn\nthe inestimable recompense of the Divine favour at the price of a due\nhumility; for this is the one way whereby men seem able to hold\ncommunion with God, and are joined to that unapproachable light by the\nvery act of supplication, even before they obtain their petitions. Then,\nsince these things can scarcely be believed to have any efficacy, if the\nnecessity of future events be admitted, what means will there be whereby\nwe may be brought near and cleave to Him who is the supreme Head of all?\nWherefore it needs must be that the human race, even as thou didst\nerstwhile declare in song, parted and dissevered from its Source, should\nfall to ruin.'\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[P] _I.e._, the necessity of the truth of the statement from the fact.\n\n\n\nSONG III. TRUTH'S PARADOXES.\n\n\n\n\n    Why does a strange discordance break\n      The ordered scheme's fair harmony?\n    Hath God decreed 'twixt truth and truth\n      There may such lasting warfare be,\n    That truths, each severally plain,\n    We strive to reconcile in vain?\n\n    Or is the discord not in truth,\n      Since truth is self consistent ever?\n    But, close in fleshly wrappings held,\n      The blinded mind of man can never\n    Discern--so faint her taper shines--\n    The subtle chain that all combines?\n\n    Ah! then why burns man's restless mind\n      Truth's hidden portals to unclose?\n    Knows he already what he seeks?\n      Why toil to seek it, if he knows?\n    Yet, haply if he knoweth not,\n    Why blindly seek he knows not what?[Q]\n\n\n    Who for a good he knows not sighs?\n      Who can an unknown end pursue?\n    How find? How e'en when haply found\n      Hail that strange form he never knew?\n    Or is it that man's inmost soul\n    Once knew each part and knew the whole?\n\n    Now, though by fleshly vapours dimmed,\n      Not all forgot her visions past;\n    For while the several parts are lost,\n      To the one whole she cleaveth fast;\n    Whence he who yearns the truth to find\n    Is neither sound of sight nor blind.\n\n    For neither does he know in full,\n      Nor is he reft of knowledge quite;\n    But, holding still to what is left,\n      He gropes in the uncertain light,\n    And by the part that still survives\n    To win back all he bravely strives.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Q] Compare Plato, 'Meno,' 80; Jowett, vol. ii., pp. 39, 40.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThen said she: 'This debate about providence is an old one, and is\nvigorously discussed by Cicero in his \"Divination\"; thou also hast long\nand earnestly pondered the problem, yet no one has had diligence and\nperseverance enough to find a solution. And the reason of this obscurity\nis that the movement of human reasoning cannot cope with the simplicity\nof the Divine foreknowledge; for if a conception of its nature could in\nany wise be framed, no shadow of uncertainty would remain. With a view\nof making this at last clear and plain, I will begin by considering the\narguments by which thou art swayed. First, I inquire into the reasons\nwhy thou art dissatisfied with the solution proposed, which is to the\neffect that, seeing the fact of foreknowledge is not thought the cause\nof the necessity of future events, foreknowledge is not to be deemed any\nhindrance to the freedom of the will. Now, surely the sole ground on\nwhich thou arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are\nforeknown cannot fail to come to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to\nacknowledge just now, the fact of foreknowledge imposes no necessity on\nthings future, what reason is there for supposing the results of\nvoluntary action constrained to a fixed issue? Suppose, for the sake of\nargument, and to see what follows, we assume that there is no\nforeknowledge. Are willed actions, then, tied down to any necessity in\n_this_ case?'\n\n'Certainly not.'\n\n'Let us assume foreknowledge again, but without its involving any actual\nnecessity; the freedom of the will, I imagine, will remain in complete\nintegrity. But thou wilt say that, even although the foreknowledge is\nnot the necessity of the future event's occurrence, yet it is a sign\nthat it will necessarily happen. Granted; but in this case it is plain\nthat, even if there had been no foreknowledge, the issues would have\nbeen inevitably certain. For a sign only indicates something which is,\ndoes not bring to pass that of which it is the sign. We require to show\nbeforehand that all things, without exception, happen of necessity in\norder that a preconception may be a sign of this necessity. Otherwise,\nif there is no such universal necessity, neither can any preconception\nbe a sign of a necessity which exists not. Manifestly, too, a proof\nestablished on firm grounds of reason must be drawn not from signs and\nloose general arguments, but from suitable and necessary causes. But how\ncan it be that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why,\nthis is to suppose us to believe that the events which providence\nforesees to be coming were not about to happen, instead of our supposing\nthat, although they should come to pass, yet there was no necessity\ninvolved in their own nature compelling their occurrence. Take an\nillustration that will help to convey my meaning. There are many things\nwhich we see taking place before our eyes--the movements of charioteers,\nfor instance, in guiding and turning their cars, and so on. Now, is any\none of these movements compelled by any necessity?'\n\n'No; certainly not. There would be no efficacy in skill if all motions\ntook place perforce.'\n\n'Then, things which in taking place are free from any necessity as to\ntheir being in the present must also, before they take place, be about\nto happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will come\nto pass, the occurrence of which is perfectly free from necessity. At\nall events, I imagine that no one will deny that things now taking place\nwere about to come to pass before they were actually happening. Such\nthings, however much foreknown, are in their occurrence _free_. For even\nas knowledge of things present imports no necessity into things that are\ntaking place, so foreknowledge of the future imports none into things\nthat are about to come. But this, thou wilt say, is the very point in\ndispute--whether any foreknowing is possible of things whose occurrence\nis not necessary. For here there seems to thee a contradiction, and, if\nthey are foreseen, their necessity follows; whereas if there is no\nnecessity, they can by no means be foreknown; and thou thinkest that\nnothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain, but if things\nwhose occurrence is uncertain are foreknown as certain, this is the very\nmist of opinion, not the truth of knowledge. For to think of things\notherwise than as they are, thou believest to be incompatible with the\nsoundness of knowledge.\n\n'Now, the cause of the mistake is this--that men think that all\nknowledge is cognized purely by the nature and efficacy of the thing\nknown. Whereas the case is the very reverse: all that is known is\ngrasped not conformably to its own efficacy, but rather conformably to\nthe faculty of the knower. An example will make this clear: the\nroundness of a body is recognised in one way by sight, in another by\ntouch. Sight looks upon it from a distance as a whole by a simultaneous\nreflection of rays; touch grasps the roundness piecemeal, by contact and\nattachment to the surface, and by actual movement round the periphery\nitself. Man himself, likewise, is viewed in one way by Sense, in another\nby Imagination, in another way, again, by Thought, in another by pure\nIntelligence. Sense judges figure clothed in material substance,\nImagination figure alone without matter. Thought transcends this again,\nand by its contemplation of universals considers the type itself which\nis contained in the individual. The eye of Intelligence is yet more\nexalted; for overpassing the sphere of the universal, it will behold\nabsolute form itself by the pure force of the mind's vision. Wherein the\nmain point to be considered is this: the higher faculty of comprehension\nembraces the lower, while the lower cannot rise to the higher. For Sense\nhas no efficacy beyond matter, nor can Imagination behold universal\nideas, nor Thought embrace pure form; but Intelligence, looking down, as\nit were, from its higher standpoint in its intuition of form,\ndiscriminates also the several elements which underlie it; but it\ncomprehends them in the same way as it comprehends that form itself,\nwhich could be cognized by no other than itself. For it cognizes the\nuniversal of Thought, the figure of Imagination, and the matter of\nSense, without employing Thought, Imagination, or Sense, but surveying\nall things, so to speak, under the aspect of pure form by a single flash\nof intuition. Thought also, in considering the universal, embraces\nimages and sense-impressions without resorting to Imagination or Sense.\nFor it is Thought which has thus defined the universal from its\nconceptual point of view: \"Man is a two-legged animal endowed with\nreason.\" This is indeed a universal notion, yet no one is ignorant that\nthe _thing_ is imaginable and presentable to Sense, because Thought\nconsiders it not by Imagination or Sense, but by means of rational\nconception. Imagination, too, though its faculty of viewing and forming\nrepresentations is founded upon the senses, nevertheless surveys\nsense-impressions without calling in Sense, not in the way of\nSense-perception, but of Imagination. See'st thou, then, how all things\nin cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the things\nwhich they cognize? Nor is this strange; for since every judgment is the\nact of the judge, it is necessary that each should accomplish its task\nby its own, not by another's power.'\n\n\n\nSONG IV. A PSYCHOLOGICAL FALLACY.\n\n[R]\n\n\n    From the Porch's murky depths\n      Comes a doctrine sage,\n    That doth liken living mind\n      To a written page;\n    Since all knowledge comes through\n      Sense,\n    Graven by Experience.\n\n    'As,' say they, 'the pen its marks\n      Curiously doth trace\n    On the smooth unsullied white\n      Of the paper's face,\n    So do outer things impress\n    Images on consciousness.'\n\n    But if verily the mind\n      Thus all passive lies;\n    If no living power within\n      Its own force supplies;\n    If it but reflect again,\n    Like a glass, things false and vain--\n\n\n    Whence the wondrous faculty\n      That perceives and knows,\n    That in one fair ordered scheme\n      Doth the world dispose;\n    Grasps each whole that Sense presents,\n    Or breaks into elements?\n\n    So divides and recombines,\n      And in changeful wise\n    Now to low descends, and now\n      To the height doth rise;\n    Last in inward swift review\n    Strictly sifts the false and true?\n\n    Of these ample potencies\n      Fitter cause, I ween,\n    Were Mind's self than marks impressed\n      By the outer scene.\n    Yet the body through the sense\n    Stirs the soul's intelligence.\n\n    When light flashes on the eye,\n      Or sound strikes the ear,\n    Mind aroused to due response\n      Makes the message clear;\n    And the dumb external signs\n    With the hidden forms combines.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[R] A criticism of the doctrine of the mind as a blank sheet of paper on\nwhich experience writes, as held by the Stoics in anticipation of Locke.\nSee Zeller, 'Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics,' Reichel's translation,\np. 76.\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\n'Now, although in the case of bodies endowed with sentiency the\nqualities of external objects affect the sense-organs, and the activity\nof mind is preceded by a bodily affection which calls forth the mind's\naction upon itself, and stimulates the forms till that moment lying\ninactive within, yet, I say, if in these bodies endowed with sentiency\nthe mind is not inscribed by mere passive affection, but of its own\nefficacy discriminates the impressions furnished to the body, how much\nmore do intelligences free from all bodily affections employ in their\ndiscrimination their own mental activities instead of conforming to\nexternal objects? So on these principles various modes of cognition\nbelong to distinct and different substances. For to creatures void of\nmotive power--shell-fish and other such creatures which cling to rocks\nand grow there--belongs Sense alone, void of all other modes of gaining\nknowledge; to beasts endowed with movement, in whom some capacity of\nseeking and shunning seems to have arisen, Imagination also. Thought\npertains only to the human race, as Intelligence to Divinity alone;\nhence it follows that that form of knowledge exceeds the rest which of\nits own nature cognizes not only its proper object, but the objects of\nthe other forms of knowledge also. But what if Sense and Imagination\nwere to gainsay Thought, and declare that universal which Thought deems\nitself to behold to be nothing? For the object of Sense and Imagination\ncannot be universal; so that either the judgment of Reason is true and\nthere is no sense-object, or, since they know full well that many\nobjects are presented to Sense and Imagination, the conception of\nReason, which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular\nas if it were a something \"universal,\" is empty of content. Suppose,\nfurther, that Reason maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate\nthe object of both Sense and Imagination under the form of\nuniversality, while Sense and Imagination cannot aspire to the\nknowledge of the universal, since their cognizance cannot go beyond\nbodily figures, and that in the cognition of reality we ought rather to\ntrust the stronger and more perfect faculty of judgment. In a dispute of\nthis sort, should not we, in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as\nwell as of imagining and perceiving, espouse the cause of Reason?\n\n'In like manner is it that human reason thinks that Divine Intelligence\ncannot see the future except after the fashion in which its own\nknowledge is obtained. For thy contention is, if events do not appear to\ninvolve certain and necessary issues, they cannot be foreseen as\ncertainly about to come to pass. There is, then, no foreknowledge of\nsuch events; or, if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there\nis, there can be nothing which does not happen of necessity. If,\nhowever, we could have some part in the judgment of the Divine mind,\neven as we participate in Reason, we should think it perfectly just that\nhuman Reason should submit itself to the Divine mind, no less than we\njudged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to Reason. Wherefore\nlet us soar, if we can, to the heights of that Supreme Intelligence; for\nthere Reason will see what in itself it cannot look upon; and that is in\nwhat way things whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a\nsure and definite foreknowledge; and that this foreknowledge is not\nconjecture, but rather knowledge in its supreme simplicity, free of all\nlimits and restrictions.'\n\n\n\nSONG V. THE UPWARD LOOK.\n\n\n    In what divers shapes and fashions do the creatures great and small\n    Over wide earth's teeming surface skim, or scud, or walk, or crawl!\n    Some with elongated body sweep the ground, and, as they move,\n    Trail perforce with writhing belly in the dust a sinuous groove;\n    Some, on light wing upward soaring, swiftly do the winds divide,\n    And through heaven's ample spaces in free motion smoothly glide;\n    These earth's solid surface pressing, with firm paces onward rove,\n    Ranging through the verdant meadows, crouching in the woodland grove.\n    Great and wondrous is their variance! Yet in all the head low-bent\n    Dulls the soul and blunts the senses, though their forms be different.\n    Man alone, erect, aspiring, lifts his forehead to the skies,\n    And in upright posture steadfast seems earth's baseness to despise.\n    If with earth not all besotted, to this parable give ear,\n    Thou whose gaze is fixed on heaven, who thy face on high dost rear:\n    Lift thy soul, too, heavenward; haply lest it stain its heavenly worth,\n    And thine eyes alone look upward, while thy mind cleaves to the earth!\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\n'Since, then, as we lately proved, everything that is known is cognized\nnot in accordance with its own nature, but in accordance with the nature\nof the faculty that comprehends it, let us now contemplate, as far as\nlawful, the character of the Divine essence, that we may be able to\nunderstand also the nature of its knowledge.\n\n'God is eternal; in this judgment all rational beings agree. Let us,\nthen, consider what eternity is. For this word carries with it a\nrevelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine knowledge. Now,\neternity is the possession of endless life whole and perfect at a single\nmoment. What this is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison\nwith things temporal. For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding\nfrom the past to the future, and there is nothing set in time which can\nembrace the whole space of its life together. To-morrow's state it\ngrasps not yet, while it has already lost yesterday's; nay, even in the\nlife of to-day ye live no longer than one brief transitory moment.\nWhatever, therefore, is subject to the condition of time, although, as\nAristotle deemed of the world, it never have either beginning or end,\nand its life be stretched to the whole extent of time's infinity, it yet\nis not such as rightly to be thought eternal. For it does not include\nand embrace the whole space of infinite life at once, but has no present\nhold on things to come, not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which\nincludes and possesses the whole fulness of unending life at once, from\nwhich nothing future is absent, from which nothing past has escaped,\nthis is rightly called eternal; this must of necessity be ever present\nto itself in full self-possession, and hold the infinity of movable time\nin an abiding present. Wherefore they deem not rightly who imagine that\non Plato's principles the created world is made co-eternal with the\nCreator, because they are told that he believed the world to have had\nno beginning in time,[S] and to be destined never to come to an end. For\nit is one thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged, which was what\nPlato ascribed to the world, another for the whole of an endless life to\nbe embraced in the present, which is manifestly a property peculiar to\nthe Divine mind. Nor need God appear earlier in mere duration of time to\ncreated things, but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature.\nFor the infinite progression of things in time copies this immediate\nexistence in the present of the changeless life, and when it cannot\nsucceed in equalling it, declines from movelessness into motion, and\nfalls away from the simplicity of a perpetual present to the infinite\nduration of the future and the past; and since it cannot possess the\nwhole fulness of its life together, for the very reason that in a manner\nit never ceases to be, it seems, up to a certain point, to rival that\nwhich it cannot complete and express by attaching itself indifferently\nto any present moment of time, however swift and brief; and since this\nbears some resemblance to that ever-abiding present, it bestows on\neverything to which it is assigned the semblance of existence. But since\nit cannot abide, it hurries along the infinite path of time, and the\nresult has been that it continues by ceaseless movement the life the\ncompleteness of which it could not embrace while it stood still. So, if\nwe are minded to give things their right names, we shall follow Plato in\nsaying that God indeed is eternal, but the world everlasting.\n\n'Since, then, every mode of judgment comprehends its objects conformably\nto its own nature, and since God abides for ever in an eternal present,\nHis knowledge, also transcending all movement of time, dwells in the\nsimplicity of its own changeless present, and, embracing the whole\ninfinite sweep of the past and of the future, contemplates all that\nfalls within its simple cognition as if it were now taking place. And\ntherefore, if thou wilt carefully consider that immediate presentment\nwhereby it discriminates all things, thou wilt more rightly deem it not\nforeknowledge as of something future, but knowledge of a moment that\nnever passes. For this cause the name chosen to describe it is not\nprevision, but providence, because, since utterly removed in nature from\nthings mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all things as from some\nlofty height. Why, then, dost thou insist that the things which are\nsurveyed by the Divine eye are involved in necessity, whereas clearly\nmen impose no necessity on things which they see? Does the act of vision\nadd any necessity to the things which thou seest before thy eyes?'\n\n'Assuredly not.'\n\n'And yet, if we may without unfitness compare God's present and man's,\njust as ye see certain things in this your temporary present, so does He\nsee all things in His eternal present. Wherefore this Divine\nanticipation changes not the natures and properties of things, and it\nbeholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter come to\npass in time. Nor does it confound things in its judgment, but in the\none mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what\nwithout necessity. For even as ye, when at one and the same time ye see\na man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky, distinguish\nbetween the two, though one glance embraces both, and judge the former\nvoluntary, the latter necessary action: so also the Divine vision in its\nuniversal range of view does in no wise confuse the characters of the\nthings which are present to its regard, though future in respect of\ntime. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will come\ninto existence, and yet is perfectly aware that this is unbound by any\nnecessity, its apprehension is not opinion, but rather knowledge based\non truth. And if to this thou sayest that what God sees to be about to\ncome to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to\ncome to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word\nnecessity, I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth,\nbut one which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the\nDivine his special study. For my answer would be that the same future\nevent is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge, but when\nconsidered in its own nature it seems absolutely free and unfettered.\nSo, then, there are two necessities--one simple, as that men are\nnecessarily mortal; the other conditioned, as that, if you know that\nsomeone is walking, he must necessarily be walking. For that which is\nknown cannot indeed be otherwise than as it is known to be, and yet this\nfact by no means carries with it that other simple necessity. For the\nformer necessity is not imposed by the thing's own proper nature, but by\nthe addition of a condition. No necessity compels one who is voluntarily\nwalking to go forward, although it is necessary for him to go forward at\nthe moment of walking. In the same way, then, if Providence sees\nanything as present, that must necessarily be, though it is bound by no\nnecessity of nature. Now, God views as present those coming events which\nhappen of free will. These, accordingly, from the standpoint of the\nDivine vision are made necessary conditionally on the Divine\ncognizance; viewed, however, in themselves, they desist not from the\nabsolute freedom naturally theirs. Accordingly, without doubt, all\nthings will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of\nthese certain proceed of free will; and though these happen, yet by the\nfact of their existence they do not lose their proper nature, in virtue\nof which before they happened it was really possible that they might not\nhave come to pass.\n\n'What difference, then, does the denial of necessity make, since,\nthrough their being conditioned by Divine knowledge, they come to pass\nas if they were in all respects under the compulsion of necessity? This\ndifference, surely, which we saw in the case of the instances I formerly\ntook, the sun's rising and the man's walking; which at the moment of\ntheir occurrence could not but be taking place, and yet one of them\nbefore it took place was necessarily obliged to be, while the other was\nnot so at all. So likewise the things which to God are present without\ndoubt exist, but some of them come from the necessity of things, others\nfrom the power of the agent. Quite rightly, then, have we said that\nthese things are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine\nknowledge; but if they are considered in themselves, they are free from\nthe bonds of necessity, even as everything which is accessible to sense,\nregarded from the standpoint of Thought, is universal, but viewed in its\nown nature particular. \"But,\" thou wilt say, \"if it is in my power to\nchange my purpose, I shall make void providence, since I shall perchance\nchange something which comes within its foreknowledge.\" My answer is:\nThou canst indeed turn aside thy purpose; but since the truth of\nprovidence is ever at hand to see that thou canst, and whether thou\ndost, and whither thou turnest thyself, thou canst not avoid the Divine\nforeknowledge, even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present\nspectator, although of thy free will thou turn thyself to various\nactions. Wilt thou, then, say: \"Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at\nmy discretion, so that, when I will this or that, providence changes its\nknowledge correspondingly?\"\n\n'Surely not.'\n\n'True, for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming, and\ntransforms and reduces it to the form of its own present knowledge, and\nvaries not, as thou deemest, in its foreknowledge, alternating to this\nor that, but in a single flash it forestalls and includes thy mutations\nwithout altering. And this ever-present comprehension and survey of all\nthings God has received, not from the issue of future events, but from\nthe simplicity of His own nature. Hereby also is resolved the objection\nwhich a little while ago gave thee offence--that our doings in the\nfuture were spoken of as if supplying the cause of God's knowledge. For\nthis faculty of knowledge, embracing all things in its immediate\ncognizance, has itself fixed the bounds of all things, yet itself owes\nnothing to what comes after.\n\n'And all this being so, the freedom of man's will stands unshaken, and\nlaws are not unrighteous, since their rewards and punishments are held\nforth to wills unbound by any necessity. God, who foreknoweth all\nthings, still looks down from above, and the ever-present eternity of\nHis vision concurs with the future character of all our acts, and\ndispenseth to the good rewards, to the bad punishments. Our hopes and\nprayers also are not fixed on God in vain, and when they are rightly\ndirected cannot fail of effect. Therefore, withstand vice, practise\nvirtue, lift up your souls to right hopes, offer humble prayers to\nHeaven. Great is the necessity of righteousness laid upon you if ye will\nnot hide it from yourselves, seeing that all your actions are done\nbefore the eyes of a Judge who seeth all things.'\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[S] Plato expressly states the opposite in the 'Timaeus' (28B), though\npossibly there the account of the beginning of the world in time is to\nbe understood figuratively, not literally.

This highest knowing, only available to God, sees \"by a single glance of the mind\" . The lower kind of knowing cannot grasp the higher knowing. Commentary on Parts III and IV       Philosophy gives a very important answer to Boethius's question about free will and Providence. It is a hotly debated question in philosophy about how God can know the future if humans have free will. What if they have not decided yet? There are those who believe that predestination is what is really going on, and humans only think they have free will. If God already knows, for instance, which souls will be saved, why should humans even bother trying to be good? It has been predetermined, like loaded dice. Philosophy tells Boethius it may seem like a paradox, but God's foreknowledge of how things will turn out does not interfere with human free will. She gives the answer that there are different forms of knowledge, and someone who has a lower ability cannot comprehend a higher ability. Animals, for instance, have sense perception, or knowing by the senses. Humans can go farther by imagining things that are not present. They can also use the mind to reason about the invisible laws of nature from inference. But an even higher knowledge like God's comes from pure intelligence, which knows everything at once without regard to time. Humans know in sequence, one thing at a time, in terms of past, present, and future, but God can know immediately what is going on everywhere. That does not mean God is interfering with us. Philosophy recites a poem about knowledge, explaining the passive model of the mind taught by the Stoics. Stoicism was a material philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium . Stoics thought the mind merely received sense impressions as on a wax tablet. As a Platonist, Boethius denied this model of knowledge. For him, the mind is spiritual and powerfully active, able to analyze and synthesize and know the truth beyond sense impression. Humans may not know like God knows, but they can participate with God in the divine nature of life through reason. Summary of Parts V and VI       Philosophy continues the topic of different kinds of knowing. Reason belongs only to the human race, just as pure intelligence belongs to divinity. Divine intelligence comprehends the lower kinds of knowing, yet human reason refuses to believe that divine intelligence can see the future in a \"boundless immediacy\" . Eternity is the \"complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of everlasting life\"  while those who live in time experience past, present, and future. Humans catch a fleeting and transitory glimpse of life only. To experience the whole of life in the present moment is characteristic of the mind of God. His knowledge transcends change. Commentary on Parts V and VI       The book finishes with this discussion of God's foreknowledge. Philosophy ends her teaching to Boethius in prison with this point in order to give him faith in Providence. Are his suffering and imprisonment simply due to chance or evil? Or can he have faith that God has foreseen all and that even the death of Boethius will be part of the good, of God's providential foresight? God sees what is happening in a never-ending present moment. The divine gaze \"looks down on all things without disturbing their nature\" . If God is on high witnessing this fate for Boethius, then it is necessary for it to happen, though God is not causing it to happen. God is the \"spectator from on high of all things\" . Therefore, Philosophy concludes, \"Avoid vice . . . cultivate virtue; lift up your mind to the right kind of hope, and put forth humble prayers on high\" . She has comforted Boethius with the idea that God is near and part of our human nature. We are always free to be with God and part of the good, no matter what fate we are handed in the world by Fortune.

Boethius has listened to and agreed with all of the arguments Philosophy has so far presented. But if God is perfect in his goodness, and is the unity of all things rules the world, how is it that evil is allowed to exist and is not always punished? In addition, where wickedness flourishes, virtue is often downtrodden and even stamped out. If God is omniscient and omnipotent and beneficent how can this evil continue in His world? Lady Philosophy reminds Boethius of his catechism - that God has said no evil will go unpunished, no virtue will be forgotten. Philosophy also asserts that the wicked are weak and have no power, and the virtuous are strong and powerful. All people strive to true happiness; the wicked cannot possibly attain it, and the virtuous can attain it. The evil people of the world seek happiness in misguided ways, and they will never attain their goal. Evil people are excluded from attaining the supreme good of perfect happiness, and therefore they are excluded from all that really exists. Since they cannot possibly attain the only thing of value any earthly power they have is not actually power at all. Evil people, Philosophy says, cease to exist. The wicked lose power and strength by striving for things that do not matter. They also lose their humanity, and become like the animals they represent by their various desires . Boethius agrees, but he laments that the wicked harm the virtuous and are not punished. Wickedness, like virtue, Philosophy assures Boethius, is its own reward. The wicked, by the fact of their very wickedness, are rewarded by their lack of existence and their descent into bestiality. The are, by their own actions rather than by any outside punishment, denied happiness. If they are punished, the evil people of the world are given a good, for they have a chance at redeeming themselves and changing their ways. When the evil people of the world escape punishment, their capacity and likelihood for more wickedness increases. Boethius finds this difficult, and protests. He can't abide that the good must suffer the earthly punishments that the evil, who deserve them, inflict upon them. This is acceptable in a world where nothing is determinate, but our world, he says, is ruled by God. How can God in his omnipotence allow this? The following argument for the foreknowledge of God is famous and somewhat difficult. Philosophy agrees that this is indeed a mystery, and no human being can hope to understand it fully. All events on Earth are happening in the unchanging mind of God, for whom there is no past, present or future. Since we are temporal beings, we cannot understand how everything that has ever happened or will happen is happening for God simultaneously, but every occurrence is contained within His mind. The government of all changeable things is called Providence. When this is applied in the temporal realm, it is called by the old pagan name of Fate. In short, Providence represents the foreknowledge of God of all things, and controls of the nature of all things. The actual connection of events which occur on Earth is Fate. Providence is the divine reason by which the world is ordered. Fate is the same reason when applied the temporal world. Because we on earth cannot understand Providence, Fate sometimes seems unordered and cruel. Because of this, anything that happens to you, good fortune or bad, is good, because if your fortune is bad it is an instruction toward virtue. This is, in short, the best of all possible worlds, for evil doesn't actually have any substance or power, and all the events of the world have been planned by Providence.","of Parts I and II       Since the existence of evil was the stumbling block for Boethius at the end of the last book, it is examined more closely now. Boethius comments that he likes the sweet songs of Philosophy, but he has not yet forgotten his sorrow. He challenges her that even though good ultimately rules the world, evil still exists and goes unpunished. What is worse, when wickedness is in charge, it not only does not reward the good, it actively punishes the good. It is a mystery how this can happen in a world ruled by an omnipotent God. Philosophy corrects his ideas, saying that the good are always strong, and the wicked always weak. Sin is always punished and virtue always rewarded. She tells him she will show him the path to bring him home, and she will give his mind wings. Then she recites a poem about the ascent of the soul to God where the soul says, \"I remember\" . Boethius says he is anxious for her to keep her promise to give his mind wings. All human activity depends on will and power, she says. The instinctive direction of the human will is towards happiness, which is the same as the good. Both good men and bad men strive for the same thing--the good. The good men become good because they are already by nature virtuous. If the bad men obtain the good, they are no longer bad. The power of good men is therefore stronger in the pursuit of good, and the bad are weaker and have to put forth more effort. Because they do not know how to gain the good, the bad are ignorant and weak through lack of self-control. If the ignorant turn to vice on purpose, they not only cease to be powerful, they cease to exist at all, because existence and life derive from the good. Whatever \"power\" the evil have, therefore, comes from weakness, not strength. Since God has the supreme power, and that supreme power is goodness, evil cannot be counted as a form of power. The wise achieve their desire, while the wicked only get pleasure without the good."],"next summary id":"book v","next chapter":"of Parts I and II       Boethius tells Philosophy he wants her to go more deeply into the topic of chance. Is there such a thing as random chance ruling our lives? Perhaps that is how he ended up in prison. Philosophy says if you define chance as randomness, there is no such thing. If God is maintaining order, there cannot be something random happening someplace, for \"nothing comes out of nothing\" . Boethius replies, how about accidents? Philosophy mentions that Aristotle's definition of chance in his Physics is, something done with one purpose, but getting a different result than was intended. Yet, it is not chance, for there are hidden causes. It may be that multiple and conflicting causes are at work, outside of the intention of the doers. If you define chance as an unpredicted or unexpected event, then perhaps you can say yes, though the events are still under the rule of law. Boethius asks if there is such a thing as free will? Philosophy replies that there is freedom for rational creatures. Humans are rational and cannot exist without it. A rational creature must choose, though freedom may not be equal for all, depending on one's clarity. Humans are more free when they participate in the contemplation of God, and less free when they act out of bodily desires. If they are wicked, they are mere slaves to their own destructive will. These choices are all visible to the eye of Providence, which predestines award or punishment according to merit."}

The Hermit remarked on how strange the ship looked with its misshapen boards and flimsy sails. The Pilot was afraid, but the Hermit encouraged him to steer the boat closer. Just as the boat reached the ship, a terrible noise came from under the water, and the ship sank straightaway. The men saved the Ancient Mariner even though they thought he was dead; after all, he appeared \\\"like one that hath been seven days drowned.\\\" The boat spun in the whirlpool created by the ship's sinking, and all was quiet save the loud sound echoing off of a hill. The Ancient Mariner moved his lips and began to row the boat, terrifying the other men; the Pilot had a conniption, the Hermit began to pray, and the Pilot's Boy laughed crazily, thinking the Ancient Mariner was the devil. When they reached the shore, the Ancient Mariner begged the Hermit to absolve him of his sins. The Hermit crossed himself and asked the Ancient Mariner what sort of man he was. The Ancient Mariner was instantly compelled to share his story with the Hermit. His need to share it was so strong that it wracked his body with pain. Once he shared it, however, he felt restored. The Ancient Mariner tells the Wedding Guest that ever since then, the urge to tell his tale has returned at unpredictable times, and he is in agony until he tells it to someone. He wanders from place to place, and has the strange power to single out the person in each location who must hear his tale. As he puts it: \\\"I have strange power of speech; \/ That moment that his face I see, \/ I know the man that must hear me: \/ To him my tale I teach.\\\" The Ancient Mariner explains that while the wedding celebration sounds uproariously entertaining, he prefers to spend his time with others in prayer. After all, he was so lonely on the ocean that he doubted even God's companionship. He bids the Wedding Guest farewell with one final piece of advice: \\\"He prayeth well, who loveth well \/ Both man and bird and beast.\\\" In other words, one becomes closer to God by respecting all living things, because God loves all of his creations \\\"both great and small.\\\" Then the Ancient Mariner vanishes. Instead of entering the wedding reception, the Wedding Guest walks away mesmerized.

Though safely in the harbor, the ship is pulled under by a forceful undertow, but the Ancient Mariner cannot drown since he is doomed to a living death.

The Hermit does not ask him where he came from or how he got to the harbor, but rather asks, \\\"What manner of man art thou?\\\" as if to discern whether or not he is human. After all, the Ancient Mariner appears dead when the rescuers pull him into the boat, and suddenly comes to life to row the boat to shore. Instead of answering the Hermit's question directly, the Ancient Mariner is forced for the first time to tell his tale, or be consumed by agony.

The Ancient Mariner's final message is that by respecting all creatures, one can become closer to God. This advice is certainly not new to the Hermit, who devotes his whole life to living in unity with nature and praying three times a day.

As in the rest of the poem, we cannot know more than the Ancient Mariner himself; by maintaining this device, Coleridge reminds us that we are subject to the same moral laws and consequences as his characters. He also maintains a position of authorial power, as though to remind us that while we inhabit his story, we are in his hands. Just as the Ancient Mariner can compel men to listen to his tale, Coleridge can compel us to read \\\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\\" from first line to last, and communicate his message to us so that we become \\\"sadder and...wiser.\\\" Coleridge famously claimed that he did not intend for \\\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\\" to have a moral, although he seems to phrase one neatly in the lines: \\\"He prayeth best, who loveth best \/ All things both great and small; \/ For the dear God who loveth us, \/ He made and loveth all.\\\" Put differently, one becomes closer to God by respecting all his creations. Coleridge uses the word \\\"teach\\\" to describe the Ancient Mariner's storytelling technique, and says that he has \\\"strange power of speech.\\\" In this way, he compares the protagonist to himself; both are gifted storytellers who impart their wisdom unto others.

Coleridge paints an equally powerful and pathetic image of the writer. He is able to hold an audience's attention so completely that he can force a man to miss his next of kin's wedding reception. He is capable of forever changing his listeners, but is also the constant victim of his own talent - a skill that torments, but never destroys.\"}","chapter":"PART THE SEVENTH.\n\n     This Hermit good lives in that wood\n     Which slopes down to the sea.\n     How loudly his sweet voice he rears!\n     He loves to talk with marineres\n     That come from a far countree.\n\n     He kneels at morn and noon and eve--\n     He hath a cushion plump:\n     It is the moss that wholly hides\n     The rotted old oak-stump.\n\n     The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,\n     \"Why this is strange, I trow!\n     Where are those lights so many and fair,\n     That signal made but now?\"\n\n     \"Strange, by my faith!\" the Hermit said--\n     \"And they answered not our cheer!\n     The planks looked warped! and see those sails,\n     How thin they are and sere!\n     I never saw aught like to them,\n     Unless perchance it were\n\n     \"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag\n     My forest-brook along;\n     When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,\n     And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,\n     That eats the she-wolf's young.\"\n\n     \"Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--\n     (The Pilot made reply)\n     I am a-feared\"--\"Push on, push on!\"\n     Said the Hermit cheerily.\n\n     The boat came closer to the ship,\n     But I nor spake nor stirred;\n     The boat came close beneath the ship,\n     And straight a sound was heard.\n\n     Under the water it rumbled on,\n     Still louder and more dread:\n     It reached the ship, it split the bay;\n     The ship went down like lead.\n\n     Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,\n     Which sky and ocean smote,\n     Like one that hath been seven days drowned\n     My body lay afloat;\n     But swift as dreams, myself I found\n     Within the Pilot's boat.\n\n     Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,\n     The boat spun round and round;\n     And all was still, save that the hill\n     Was telling of the sound.\n\n     I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked\n     And fell down in a fit;\n     The holy Hermit raised his eyes,\n     And prayed where he did sit.\n\n     I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,\n     Who now doth crazy go,\n     Laughed loud and long, and all the while\n     His eyes went to and fro.\n     \"Ha! ha!\" quoth he, \"full plain I see,\n     The Devil knows how to row.\"\n\n     And now, all in my own countree,\n     I stood on the firm land!\n     The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,\n     And scarcely he could stand.\n\n     \"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!\"\n     The Hermit crossed his brow.\n     \"Say quick,\" quoth he, \"I bid thee say--\n     What manner of man art thou?\"\n\n     Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched\n     With a woeful agony,\n     Which forced me to begin my tale;\n     And then it left me free.\n\n     Since then, at an uncertain hour,\n     That agony returns;\n     And till my ghastly tale is told,\n     This heart within me burns.\n\n     I pass, like night, from land to land;\n     I have strange power of speech;\n     That moment that his face I see,\n     I know the man that must hear me:\n     To him my tale I teach.\n\n     What loud uproar bursts from that door!\n     The wedding-guests are there:\n     But in the garden-bower the bride\n     And bride-maids singing are:\n     And hark the little vesper bell,\n     Which biddeth me to prayer!\n\n     O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been\n     Alone on a wide wide sea:\n     So lonely 'twas, that God himself\n     Scarce seemed there to be.\n\n     O sweeter than the marriage-feast,\n     'Tis sweeter far to me,\n     To walk together to the kirk\n     With a goodly company!--\n\n     To walk together to the kirk,\n     And all together pray,\n     While each to his great Father bends,\n     Old men, and babes, and loving friends,\n     And youths and maidens gay!\n\n     Farewell, farewell! but this I tell\n     To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!\n     He prayeth well, who loveth well\n     Both man and bird and beast.\n\n     He prayeth best, who loveth best\n     All things both great and small;\n     For the dear God who loveth us\n     He made and loveth all.\n\n     The Mariner, whose eye is bright,\n     Whose beard with age is hoar,\n     Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest\n     Turned from the bridegroom's door.\n\n     He went like one that hath been stunned,\n     And is of sense forlorn:\n     A sadder and a wiser man,\n     He rose the morrow morn.\n\n\n","chapter_length":1125.0,"summary_name":"Part 7","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210422155712\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner\/study-guide\/summary-part-7","summary_text":"The Ancient Mariner was cheered by the Hermit's singing.

Olivia enters and orders her servants to \\\"Take the fool away.\\\" Feste responds by saying something like, \\\"Hey--didn't you hear Olivia say take the fool away? Take her away already.\\\" Olivia is totally amused, but pretends she's not, so Feste will have to convince her that he should be allowed to stay and make her laugh. Then Feste makes a crack about why Olivia really is a fool--she's wasting her time mourning for a dead brother who's in a better place , while she mopes around in her crazy, all black get-up. Malvolio asks Olivia why she lets Feste hang around. Malvolio claims that Feste isn't really that funny and, besides, he saw some other comedian totally clown him the other day. Olivia tells Malvolio to beat it--he's a bitter jerk if he doesn't see how great Feste is. Maria enters then with news that there's some dumb kid at the gate who wants to talk to Olivia. He's not taking \\\"no\\\" for an answer and Maria doesn't know what to do. Olivia tells Malvolio to go to the gate and say she's sick or busy or whatever. The kid should hit the road ASAP because she's not in the mood to talk. Feste makes a random joke about how brainless Sir Toby Belch is, just as Olivia's uncle enters the room. Olivia then takes Toby to task for being a drunk and spending all his time partying. She also asks him about who's at the gate. Toby gives her a drunken answer that basically amounts to, \\\"Don't know, don't care,\\\" and staggers out. Olivia sends Feste to look after him. Malvolio reenters the room and confirms that, yep, there's an annoying kid at the gate who says he's not going anywhere until he sees Olivia. Olivia asks what the messenger is like and Malvolio says that he doesn't seem old enough to be a man or young enough to be a boy. The kid also speaks like a \\\"shrew.\\\" Intrigued, Olivia lets the kid inside, but not before she covers her face with her black veil. \\\"Cesario\\\" enters the room and asks which one of the lovely ladies is Olivia--\\\"he's\\\" got to deliver a message from the Duke. Olivia's not interested in the Duke, but the kid is intriguing so she chats him up. \\\"Cesario\\\" says \\\"he's\\\" got this whole message memorized, so Olivia should just please pipe down and let \\\"him\\\" deliver it.

Those wits\nthat think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I, that am\nsure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says\nQuinapalus? Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.--God bless\nthee, lady!\n\nOLIVIA.\nTake the fool away.\n\nCLOWN.\nDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGo to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you: besides, you\ngrow dishonest.\n\nCLOWN.\nTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend:\nfor give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the\ndishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer\ndishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything\nthat's mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but\npatched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.\nIf that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,\nwhat remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so\nbeauty's a flower:--the lady bade take away the fool; therefore,\nI say again, take her away.\n\nOLIVIA.\nSir, I bade them take away you.\n\nCLOWN.\nMisprision in the highest degree!--Lady, Cucullus non facit\nmonachum; that's as much to say, I wear not motley in my\nbrain.

Well, it's all one.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nOLIVIA.\nWhat's a drunken man like, fool?\n\nCLOWN.\nLike a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above\nheat makes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns\nhim.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGo thou and seek the coroner, and let him sit o' my coz;\nfor he's in the third degree of drink; he's drowned: go, look\nafter him.\n\nCLOWN.\nHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the\nmadman.\n\n[Exit CLOWN.]\n\n[Re-enter MALVOLIO.]\n\nMALVOLIO.\nMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.

He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly;\none would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.\n\nOLIVIA.\nLet him approach.

What I am and what I would are as secret as\nmaidenhead: to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.\n\nOLIVIA.\nGive us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.\n\n[Exit MARIA.]\n\nNow, sir, what is your text?\n\nVIOLA.\nMost sweet lady,--\n\nOLIVIA.\nA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.\nWhere lies your text?\n\nVIOLA.\nIn Orsino's bosom.\n\nOLIVIA.\nIn his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?\n\nVIOLA.\nTo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.\n\nOLIVIA.\nO, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?\n\nVIOLA.\nGood madam, let me see your face.\n\nOLIVIA.\nHave you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my\nface? you are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain\nand show you the picture.

Feste makes a dirty joke about how \"well hung\" he is when Maria tells him that Olivia will literally hang him because he hasn't shown up to work in such a long time. Olivia enters and orders her servants to \"Take the fool away.\" Feste responds by saying something like, \"Hey--didn't you hear Olivia say take the fool away? Take her away already.\" Olivia is totally amused, but pretends she's not, so Feste will have to convince her that he should be allowed to stay and make her laugh. Then Feste makes a crack about why Olivia really is a fool--she's wasting her time mourning for a dead brother who's in a better place , while she mopes around in her crazy, all black get-up. Malvolio asks Olivia why she lets Feste hang around. Malvolio claims that Feste isn't really that funny and, besides, he saw some other comedian totally clown him the other day. Olivia tells Malvolio to beat it--he's a bitter jerk if he doesn't see how great Feste is. Maria enters then with news that there's some dumb kid at the gate who wants to talk to Olivia. He's not taking \"no\" for an answer and Maria doesn't know what to do. Olivia tells Malvolio to go to the gate and say she's sick or busy or whatever. The kid should hit the road ASAP because she's not in the mood to talk. Feste makes a random joke about how brainless Sir Toby Belch is, just as Olivia's uncle enters the room. Olivia then takes Toby to task for being a drunk and spending all his time partying. She also asks him about who's at the gate. Toby gives her a drunken answer that basically amounts to, \"Don't know, don't care,\" and staggers out. Olivia sends Feste to look after him. Malvolio reenters the room and confirms that, yep, there's an annoying kid at the gate who says he's not going anywhere until he sees Olivia. Olivia asks what the messenger is like and Malvolio says that he doesn't seem old enough to be a man or young enough to be a boy. The kid also speaks like a \"shrew.\" Intrigued, Olivia lets the kid inside, but not before she covers her face with her black veil. \"Cesario\" enters the room and asks which one of the lovely ladies is Olivia--\"he's\" got to deliver a message from the Duke. Olivia's not interested in the Duke, but the kid is intriguing so she chats him up. \"Cesario\" says \"he's\" got this whole message memorized, so Olivia should just please pipe down and let \"him\" deliver it. Olivia's not interested in Duke Orsino's cliche attempts to sweet talk her, so she toys with \"Cesario\" for a while and asks why he was so lippy when he was out at the gate. \"Cesario\" insists that \"he\" needs to speak to Olivia alone so he can deliver his private message. \"Cesario\" tries to deliver the memorized speech again, but Olivia cuts \"him\" off and mocks the Duke's little love letter. \"Cesario\" asks to see Olivia's face and Olivia removes her veil. \"Cesario\" says that Olivia is gorgeous--she should get married and have some good looking kids with Orsino. Exasperated, Olivia says that the Duke already knows she's not into him. He's nice and all, and rich, and handsome, but he needs to learn to take \"no\" for an answer. \"Cesario\" says that doesn't make any sense.

Olivia tells \"Cesario\" to go back to Orsino and tell him to quit bothering her. Then Cesario should come back and tell Olivia what the Duke has to say about that.

Viola , who has clearly spent a lot of time with Orsino in the past three days, asks Valentine if the Duke has mood swings. Just then, Orsino enters looking for \"Cesario\"--he wants his boy to trot on over to Olivia's place to chat her up for him. Orsino says that \"Cesario\" is the man for the job since \"he\" already knows how Orsino feels about Olivia and that \"he\" shouldn't take no for an answer if Olivia's servants try to shoo \"him\" away. \"Cesario\" is skeptical since it sounds like Olivia is really upset about her dead brother. Orsino tells \"Cesario\" to do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if he has to cause a big scene at Olivia's house. Okay, fine, agrees \"Cesario,\" who asks what \"he\" is supposed to do if \"he\" actually makes it inside Olivia's pad. Duke Orsino seems to think that Olivia will be so moved by \"Cesario's\" youth and girlish beauty that she'll want to hook up with the Duke. Orsino then proceeds to describe \"Cesario's\" luscious ruby red lips and high pitched voice, all of which he believes will get Olivia in the mood for some lovin'. Viola agrees to do this but then she drops a bombshell on the audience: it's going to be brutal for her to be Orsino's wingman because she is falling for the Duke. The situation stinks because she wants to be the Duke's wife, but now she has to try to convince Olivia to marry the Duke.","Back at Orsino's court, the Duke orders his band to play a song he heard the night before. Curio says sorry, but Feste's not here to sing it. He must be over at Olivia's house because he used to work for Olivia's dad when he was alive. Duke Orsino tells Curio to find Feste, who happens to be roaming around somewhere in the Duke's pad. Orsino then turns to \"Cesario\" and gives \"him\" some friendly advice, man-to-man, about love. Orsino says if \"Cesario\" ever falls in love, he should be reminded of the Duke, who--like all true lovers--is unable to do anything but think of the one he adores. Orsino suspects that \"Cesario\" is in love and \"Cesario\" admits that yes, \"he\" is in love with someone who looks like the Duke and is about the same age. Orsino assumes \"Cesario's\" in love with an older woman, so he tells \"Cesario\" it's not a good idea for men to marry older women. \"Cesario\" should marry a sweet young thing because women age fast, which makes them less attractive to their husbands. Women are also not as attractive after they're no longer virgins. Viola's sad response tells us that she worries about aging and becoming less attractive to a potential husband. Feste enters and sings a song for the Duke about a man who is \"slain\" by a \"cruel maid.\" Orsino gives Feste some money for his trouble and says it's late--he wants to go to bed. Feste makes a crack about how moody the Duke's behavior is before leaving. Orsino sends everyone away, except \"Cesario.\" He tells \"Cesario\" to go see Olivia again and try one more time to tell her how much Orsino loves her. \"Cesario\" doesn't think it will work. Olivia has already said she can't love him, but Orsino won't accept that answer. \"Cesario\" says, but wait--if some woman other than Olivia loved you, you wouldn't love her back, right? Because you love Olivia and no one else. Pah! Orsino says no woman could possibly resist the level of passion he feels. Love works differently for women, and no woman is capable of being so in love as the Duke--his love is like the ocean, etc., etc. \"Cesario\" disagrees and says that women are just as capable of love as men. \"He\" tells the story of his \"father's daughter\" who once loved a man but never told him. Instead she loved him from a distance, feeling incredibly sad but graciously accepting her fate. That sounds horrible to us, but \"Cesario\" says that's true love--truer, in fact, than the love of men who are loud about declaring their love but not as faithful with their actions. When Orsino asks what happened to \"Cesario's\" sister, \"Cesario\" cryptically replies that \"he\" doesn't know, even though he is the only daughter and the only son in \"his\" father's house. If Orsino were paying attention, he might understand that Viola has just outed herself. But he's still focused on Olivia. Plus, Viola changes the subject FAST. She says, \"Did you want me to give this jewel to Olivia?\" before he can react to her strange statement, and off they go.","In her garden, Olivia frets about whether or not \"Cesario\" will come back for a little visit. Then she asks Maria where Malvolio is. Maria tells Olivia that Malvolio's on his way, but he's acting like he's possessed by demons--he's been smiling a lot and for no good reason. When Malvolio enters in a ridiculous get-up and a silly grin on his face, Olivia asks what the heck's wrong with him. She wants to know why he's smiling like an idiot when she's in such a sad mood. Malvolio continues to act like a fool--slobbering on Olivia's hand, talking nonsense, and insulting Maria. When Malvolio quotes lines from the forged letter, Olivia has no idea what he's talking about and thinks he's totally lost his mind. Malvolio presses on and asks Olivia if she remembers telling him to wear yellow stockings and cross-garters. When a servant enters and announces that \"Cesario\" has arrived, Olivia tells Maria to fetch Toby and company to look after Malvolio so she can rush off to greet \"Cesario.\" Malvolio's left alone and tells us that he thinks Olivia is totally into him--he can't wait to carry out the instructions of the letter by being rude to Sir Toby. Sir Toby and Fabian enter and pretend to think Malvolio's possessed and needs an exorcism. Malvolio tells them to get lost , but Maria says, see guys, I told you his body's been taken over by a devil. Malvolio is totally confused by the crew's behavior, especially when Fabian suggests they get a urine sample and make Malvolio say his prayers. Malvolio tells them to get lost and runs away, leaving the crew to comment about how delicious their prank is. They decide to chase after Malvolio and lock him up in a dark room that will make Malvolio go crazy. Just then, Sir Andrew Aguecheek enters with the letter he has written to challenge \"Cesario\" to a duel. Toby reads the hilariously insulting letter aloud and assures Aguecheek that he'll deliver the note to \"Cesario.\" In the meantime, Aguecheek should go hide in the orchard. When \"Cesario\" shows up, Aguecheek should jump out from behind a tree, draw his sword, and say something scary to \"Cesario.\" Aguecheek runs off to the orchard and Toby tells Fabian and Maria that he's not going to deliver Aguecheek's silly letter. Instead, Toby's going to deliver a verbal message to \"Cesario.\" Since both \"Cesario\" and Aguecheek are wimps, they'll both be shaking in their boots at the thought of fighting each other. Olivia and \"Cesario\" enter just then, but Toby and crew run off to work out the details of their plan before confronting \"Cesario.\" This gives Olivia a chance to be alone with the luscious \"boy.\" Olivia says she knows \"Cesario\" isn't into her, but she just can't help herself. She accuses \"Cesario\" of having a \"heart of stone.\" \"Cesario\" replies that Duke Orsino feels just as sad as Olivia does--unrequited love is a bummer for everyone and Orsino still wants Olivia. Olivia begs \"Cesario\" to wear her miniature and to come back to Olivia's place tomorrow so Olivia can try to seduce \"him\" again. After Olivia leaves, Toby Belch and Fabian enter again and tell \"Cesario\" that someone's in the garden waiting to beat him into a pulp. \"Cesario's\" terrified and insists that \"he\" isn't a fighter. Too bad, says Toby, whip out your sword! \"Cesario\" asks Fabian for help. Fabian lies and says he'll try to help smooth things over so \"Cesario\" doesn't get a beat down. Meanwhile, Sir Toby goes into the orchard and tells Aguecheek that \"Cesario\" is crazy and can't wait to fight him. Aguecheek is terrified and tries to back out but Toby tells him it's too late--he better get ready to rumble because \"Cesario\" is ready to go. Sir Andrew tells Toby to tell \"Cesario\" that Sir Andrew will give him his horse if \"Cesario\" doesn't beat him up. OK, says, Toby, who runs over to \"Cesario\" and says Sir Andrew's ready to mop the floor with him. Toby forces \"Cesario\" and Aguecheek together and the two draw their swords. Just then, Antonio enters and thinks that \"Cesario\" is his boy, Sebastian. Antonio's scared for his boy \"Sebastian\" and tries to break up the fight. He and Toby trade insults and draw their swords. \"Cesario\" and Aguecheek put their swords away and Aguecheek promises \"Cesario\" his horse. Then, the cops show up to arrest Antonio, who has been recognized as one of the pirates who stole from the Duke. Since Antonio thinks that \"Cesario\" is Sebastian, he asks \"him\" to return the money he gave him earlier so he can buy his way out of jail. \"Cesario\" has no idea what Antonio's talking about but, being a nice person, \"Cesario\" gives him some money anyway. Antonio is hurt because he thinks Sebastian has hung him out to dry. He can't believe Sebastian would screw him over like this, after everything Antonio's done for him. He goes off about how he saved Sebastian from drowning, has been a devoted and loving friend, and then calls Sebastian a devil. The cops couldn't care less about any of this drama and they haul Antonio off to the clink. Meanwhile, it finally occurs to Viola that Antonio has mistaken her for her twin brother, Sebastian, since the siblings look so much alike. This gives Viola some hope that Sebastian is still alive and didn't drown at sea after all. Viola, still disguised as \"Cesario,\" keeps this info to herself. After \"Cesario\" runs off stage, Toby, Fabian, and the cowardly Aguecheek hang back and talk trash about what a wimp \"Cesario\" has turned out to be. Aguecheek pretends like he wasn't shaking in his boots two minutes ago and says he ought to run after \"Cesario\" and beat him down. Toby Belch eggs on Aguecheek and they run off after \"Cesario.\""],"next summary id":"act 1, scene 5","next chapter":"Over at Olivia's place, Maria and Feste the Clown goof around, talking trash. Feste makes a dirty joke about how \"well hung\" he is when Maria tells him that Olivia will literally hang him because he hasn't shown up to work in such a long time. Olivia enters and orders her servants to \"Take the fool away.\" Feste responds by saying something like, \"Hey--didn't you hear Olivia say take the fool away? Take her away already.\" Olivia is totally amused, but pretends she's not, so Feste will have to convince her that he should be allowed to stay and make her laugh. Then Feste makes a crack about why Olivia really is a fool--she's wasting her time mourning for a dead brother who's in a better place , while she mopes around in her crazy, all black get-up. Malvolio asks Olivia why she lets Feste hang around. Malvolio claims that Feste isn't really that funny and, besides, he saw some other comedian totally clown him the other day. Olivia tells Malvolio to beat it--he's a bitter jerk if he doesn't see how great Feste is. Maria enters then with news that there's some dumb kid at the gate who wants to talk to Olivia. He's not taking \"no\" for an answer and Maria doesn't know what to do. Olivia tells Malvolio to go to the gate and say she's sick or busy or whatever. The kid should hit the road ASAP because she's not in the mood to talk. Feste makes a random joke about how brainless Sir Toby Belch is, just as Olivia's uncle enters the room. Olivia then takes Toby to task for being a drunk and spending all his time partying. She also asks him about who's at the gate. Toby gives her a drunken answer that basically amounts to, \"Don't know, don't care,\" and staggers out. Olivia sends Feste to look after him. Malvolio reenters the room and confirms that, yep, there's an annoying kid at the gate who says he's not going anywhere until he sees Olivia. Olivia asks what the messenger is like and Malvolio says that he doesn't seem old enough to be a man or young enough to be a boy. The kid also speaks like a \"shrew.\" Intrigued, Olivia lets the kid inside, but not before she covers her face with her black veil. \"Cesario\" enters the room and asks which one of the lovely ladies is Olivia--\"he's\" got to deliver a message from the Duke. Olivia's not interested in the Duke, but the kid is intriguing so she chats him up. \"Cesario\" says \"he's\" got this whole message memorized, so Olivia should just please pipe down and let \"him\" deliver it. Olivia's not interested in Duke Orsino's cliche attempts to sweet talk her, so she toys with \"Cesario\" for a while and asks why he was so lippy when he was out at the gate. \"Cesario\" insists that \"he\" needs to speak to Olivia alone so he can deliver his private message. \"Cesario\" tries to deliver the memorized speech again, but Olivia cuts \"him\" off and mocks the Duke's little love letter. \"Cesario\" asks to see Olivia's face and Olivia removes her veil. \"Cesario\" says that Olivia is gorgeous--she should get married and have some good looking kids with Orsino. Exasperated, Olivia says that the Duke already knows she's not into him. He's nice and all, and rich, and handsome, but he needs to learn to take \"no\" for an answer. \"Cesario\" says that doesn't make any sense. Then Olivia asks \"Cesario\" what he would do if he loved her and \"Cesario\" says \"he\" would stand at Olivia's gate and sing love poetry until Olivia took pity on \"him.\" Olivia is totally smitten when she hears this and she asks \"Cesario\" about his parentage, to which \"Cesario\" replies that \"he\" is well-born. Olivia tells \"Cesario\" to go back to Orsino and tell him to quit bothering her. Then Cesario should come back and tell Olivia what the Duke has to say about that. Olivia tries to give \"Cesario\" a few coins for his trouble, but \"Cesario\" tells her to keep her money. When \"Cesario\" leaves, Olivia says \"Cesario\" is a total dream-boat. Malvolio enters the room and Olivia lies and says that \"Cesario\" gave her a ring from the Duke. She says she doesn't want it so Malvolio should run after \"Cesario\" and return the trinket, ASAP. Olivia has apparently forgotten about her quest to mourn for her dead brother. She tells us that \"fate\" has brought \"Cesario\" to her, so she'll let whatever happens happen."}

I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in\nyellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of\nputting on. Jove and my stars be praised!--Here is yet a\npostscript.

Viola , who has clearly spent a lot of time with Orsino in the past three days, asks Valentine if the Duke has mood swings. Just then, Orsino enters looking for \"Cesario\"--he wants his boy to trot on over to Olivia's place to chat her up for him. Orsino says that \"Cesario\" is the man for the job since \"he\" already knows how Orsino feels about Olivia and that \"he\" shouldn't take no for an answer if Olivia's servants try to shoo \"him\" away. \"Cesario\" is skeptical since it sounds like Olivia is really upset about her dead brother. Orsino tells \"Cesario\" to do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if he has to cause a big scene at Olivia's house. Okay, fine, agrees \"Cesario,\" who asks what \"he\" is supposed to do if \"he\" actually makes it inside Olivia's pad. Duke Orsino seems to think that Olivia will be so moved by \"Cesario's\" youth and girlish beauty that she'll want to hook up with the Duke. Orsino then proceeds to describe \"Cesario's\" luscious ruby red lips and high pitched voice, all of which he believes will get Olivia in the mood for some lovin'. Viola agrees to do this but then she drops a bombshell on the audience: it's going to be brutal for her to be Orsino's wingman because she is falling for the Duke. The situation stinks because she wants to be the Duke's wife, but now she has to try to convince Olivia to marry the Duke.","Back at Orsino's court, the Duke orders his band to play a song he heard the night before. Curio says sorry, but Feste's not here to sing it. He must be over at Olivia's house because he used to work for Olivia's dad when he was alive. Duke Orsino tells Curio to find Feste, who happens to be roaming around somewhere in the Duke's pad. Orsino then turns to \"Cesario\" and gives \"him\" some friendly advice, man-to-man, about love. Orsino says if \"Cesario\" ever falls in love, he should be reminded of the Duke, who--like all true lovers--is unable to do anything but think of the one he adores. Orsino suspects that \"Cesario\" is in love and \"Cesario\" admits that yes, \"he\" is in love with someone who looks like the Duke and is about the same age. Orsino assumes \"Cesario's\" in love with an older woman, so he tells \"Cesario\" it's not a good idea for men to marry older women. \"Cesario\" should marry a sweet young thing because women age fast, which makes them less attractive to their husbands. Women are also not as attractive after they're no longer virgins. Viola's sad response tells us that she worries about aging and becoming less attractive to a potential husband. Feste enters and sings a song for the Duke about a man who is \"slain\" by a \"cruel maid.\" Orsino gives Feste some money for his trouble and says it's late--he wants to go to bed. Feste makes a crack about how moody the Duke's behavior is before leaving. Orsino sends everyone away, except \"Cesario.\" He tells \"Cesario\" to go see Olivia again and try one more time to tell her how much Orsino loves her. \"Cesario\" doesn't think it will work. Olivia has already said she can't love him, but Orsino won't accept that answer. \"Cesario\" says, but wait--if some woman other than Olivia loved you, you wouldn't love her back, right? Because you love Olivia and no one else. Pah! Orsino says no woman could possibly resist the level of passion he feels. Love works differently for women, and no woman is capable of being so in love as the Duke--his love is like the ocean, etc., etc. \"Cesario\" disagrees and says that women are just as capable of love as men. \"He\" tells the story of his \"father's daughter\" who once loved a man but never told him. Instead she loved him from a distance, feeling incredibly sad but graciously accepting her fate. That sounds horrible to us, but \"Cesario\" says that's true love--truer, in fact, than the love of men who are loud about declaring their love but not as faithful with their actions. When Orsino asks what happened to \"Cesario's\" sister, \"Cesario\" cryptically replies that \"he\" doesn't know, even though he is the only daughter and the only son in \"his\" father's house. If Orsino were paying attention, he might understand that Viola has just outed herself. But he's still focused on Olivia. Plus, Viola changes the subject FAST. She says, \"Did you want me to give this jewel to Olivia?\" before he can react to her strange statement, and off they go.","In her garden, Olivia frets about whether or not \"Cesario\" will come back for a little visit. Then she asks Maria where Malvolio is. Maria tells Olivia that Malvolio's on his way, but he's acting like he's possessed by demons--he's been smiling a lot and for no good reason. When Malvolio enters in a ridiculous get-up and a silly grin on his face, Olivia asks what the heck's wrong with him. She wants to know why he's smiling like an idiot when she's in such a sad mood. Malvolio continues to act like a fool--slobbering on Olivia's hand, talking nonsense, and insulting Maria. When Malvolio quotes lines from the forged letter, Olivia has no idea what he's talking about and thinks he's totally lost his mind. Malvolio presses on and asks Olivia if she remembers telling him to wear yellow stockings and cross-garters. When a servant enters and announces that \"Cesario\" has arrived, Olivia tells Maria to fetch Toby and company to look after Malvolio so she can rush off to greet \"Cesario.\" Malvolio's left alone and tells us that he thinks Olivia is totally into him--he can't wait to carry out the instructions of the letter by being rude to Sir Toby. Sir Toby and Fabian enter and pretend to think Malvolio's possessed and needs an exorcism. Malvolio tells them to get lost , but Maria says, see guys, I told you his body's been taken over by a devil. Malvolio is totally confused by the crew's behavior, especially when Fabian suggests they get a urine sample and make Malvolio say his prayers. Malvolio tells them to get lost and runs away, leaving the crew to comment about how delicious their prank is. They decide to chase after Malvolio and lock him up in a dark room that will make Malvolio go crazy. Just then, Sir Andrew Aguecheek enters with the letter he has written to challenge \"Cesario\" to a duel. Toby reads the hilariously insulting letter aloud and assures Aguecheek that he'll deliver the note to \"Cesario.\" In the meantime, Aguecheek should go hide in the orchard. When \"Cesario\" shows up, Aguecheek should jump out from behind a tree, draw his sword, and say something scary to \"Cesario.\" Aguecheek runs off to the orchard and Toby tells Fabian and Maria that he's not going to deliver Aguecheek's silly letter. Instead, Toby's going to deliver a verbal message to \"Cesario.\" Since both \"Cesario\" and Aguecheek are wimps, they'll both be shaking in their boots at the thought of fighting each other. Olivia and \"Cesario\" enter just then, but Toby and crew run off to work out the details of their plan before confronting \"Cesario.\" This gives Olivia a chance to be alone with the luscious \"boy.\" Olivia says she knows \"Cesario\" isn't into her, but she just can't help herself. She accuses \"Cesario\" of having a \"heart of stone.\" \"Cesario\" replies that Duke Orsino feels just as sad as Olivia does--unrequited love is a bummer for everyone and Orsino still wants Olivia. Olivia begs \"Cesario\" to wear her miniature and to come back to Olivia's place tomorrow so Olivia can try to seduce \"him\" again. After Olivia leaves, Toby Belch and Fabian enter again and tell \"Cesario\" that someone's in the garden waiting to beat him into a pulp. \"Cesario's\" terrified and insists that \"he\" isn't a fighter. Too bad, says Toby, whip out your sword! \"Cesario\" asks Fabian for help. Fabian lies and says he'll try to help smooth things over so \"Cesario\" doesn't get a beat down. Meanwhile, Sir Toby goes into the orchard and tells Aguecheek that \"Cesario\" is crazy and can't wait to fight him. Aguecheek is terrified and tries to back out but Toby tells him it's too late--he better get ready to rumble because \"Cesario\" is ready to go. Sir Andrew tells Toby to tell \"Cesario\" that Sir Andrew will give him his horse if \"Cesario\" doesn't beat him up. OK, says, Toby, who runs over to \"Cesario\" and says Sir Andrew's ready to mop the floor with him. Toby forces \"Cesario\" and Aguecheek together and the two draw their swords. Just then, Antonio enters and thinks that \"Cesario\" is his boy, Sebastian. Antonio's scared for his boy \"Sebastian\" and tries to break up the fight. He and Toby trade insults and draw their swords. \"Cesario\" and Aguecheek put their swords away and Aguecheek promises \"Cesario\" his horse. Then, the cops show up to arrest Antonio, who has been recognized as one of the pirates who stole from the Duke. Since Antonio thinks that \"Cesario\" is Sebastian, he asks \"him\" to return the money he gave him earlier so he can buy his way out of jail. \"Cesario\" has no idea what Antonio's talking about but, being a nice person, \"Cesario\" gives him some money anyway. Antonio is hurt because he thinks Sebastian has hung him out to dry. He can't believe Sebastian would screw him over like this, after everything Antonio's done for him. He goes off about how he saved Sebastian from drowning, has been a devoted and loving friend, and then calls Sebastian a devil. The cops couldn't care less about any of this drama and they haul Antonio off to the clink. Meanwhile, it finally occurs to Viola that Antonio has mistaken her for her twin brother, Sebastian, since the siblings look so much alike. This gives Viola some hope that Sebastian is still alive and didn't drown at sea after all. Viola, still disguised as \"Cesario,\" keeps this info to herself. After \"Cesario\" runs off stage, Toby, Fabian, and the cowardly Aguecheek hang back and talk trash about what a wimp \"Cesario\" has turned out to be. Aguecheek pretends like he wasn't shaking in his boots two minutes ago and says he ought to run after \"Cesario\" and beat him down. Toby Belch eggs on Aguecheek and they run off after \"Cesario.\""],"next summary id":"act 2, scene 5","next chapter":"In Olivia's garden, Toby and Aguecheek hang out with Fabian, who worries that he'll get in trouble again if he helps them trick Malvolio.

They strike up a friendship and discuss the race question. The doctor is \\\"broad-minded\\\" and believes that \\\"Negroes\\\" are progressing, although he sympathizes with certain aspects of the white, Southern perspective. The narrator stays with his new friend in Boston for a few days and then accompanies him to Washington D.C., where the doctor lives. The narrator becomes quickly acquainted with the doctor's friends, all educated African Americans, who earn \\\"good salaries and a reasonable amount of leisure time to draw from\\\" . The doctor, meanwhile, is very critical of who he deems \\\"the worst\\\" of the race. The narrator reflects positively on his time in Washington but then moves on to Macon, Georgia. On the way, he ends up in the smoking car of the train. The men gathered there are cordial and convivial; they include a Jewish cigar maker, a white professor, an ex-Union soldier, and a boisterous Texan planter. The race question comes up. The Jewish man takes neither side but listens and comments politely. The professor is flustered and does not participate. The argument is mostly between the old soldier and the Texan. The Texan does not believe in racial equality at all while the Union soldier argues for it. The Texan tries to claim the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race, but the soldier ably and eloquently explains that all of the accomplishments of the Anglo-Saxons are built on discoveries made by other races. The Texan is impressed, but jovially says his mind will never be changed. The narrator cannot help but admire his steadfastness, but also hopes that the mental attitudes of Southerners can be changed one day. In Macon, the narrator decides to leave his things behind and travel through the country. He sees rural African Americans for the first time and is not impressed. He is also annoyed with the poor cooking and accommodations of the South, wondering if his millionaire friend was right. He discourses for some time on the differences between the North and the South in their feelings on \\\"the colored man\\\". While he is in the South, the narrator also attends a \\\"big meeting\\\", which is a large religious gathering. It is a boisterous and exciting atmosphere. The narrator observes one impressive preacher, John Brown, and a music leader, Singing Johnson. Brown demonstrates \\\"all the arts and tricks of oratory\\\" and holds his listeners spellbound with his sermons about heaven and hell. Meanwhile, Johnson knows all of the spiritual songs and is a master at leading the congregation. The narrator marvels at the wonder of his songs' production. He feels inspired by this meeting. The narrator decides to stay with a young African American schoolteacher for a few days. This man strikes the narrator as being too earnest about the race question, but intelligent and ambitious nonetheless. They retire to a boarding house but the narrator is stirred awake by a frantic sounds outside. He hears a rumor from the people flowing past the house that a crime has been committed. Defying the schoolteacher's warnings, the narrator leaves the house and joins a crowd at the station. It is mostly white people with some black people at the fringes. A \\\"poor wretch\\\", a black man, is dragged into the circle. The white people throw up a fiendish \\\"rebel yell\\\", resembling \\\"savage beasts\\\". They tie the man to a stake and burn him alive. The narrator is horrified and dazed, but he is also humiliated that he is part of a race that can be victim to such horrible crimes. He is also in disbelief at how \\\"a people that can find in its conscience any excuse whatever for slowly burning to death a human being, or for tolerating such an act, can be entrusted with the salvation of a race\\\". He ultimately decides that he will not claim or declaim his blackness and will simply pass for whatever people assume his race to be. He departs for New York. Back in New York, the narrator feels lost but decides to amuse himself for a few days before looking for a job. This endeavor is depressing and he decides to enroll in business school. It is not long before he becomes a clerk in a wholesale house. He lives frugally and then begins investing in real estate, at which he is extremely successful. He passes for white and is content with this until the day he falls in love with a woman. She is a singer and the narrator describes her as \\\"the most dazzlingly white thing I have ever seen\\\". They begin courting and he decides he wants to marry her; this makes him wonder if he should tell her the truth about his face. He agonizes over this decision for some time. One Sunday afternoon the narrator and the girl run into Shiny on the street. Now a professor, Shiny is in town to work in a summer school before getting married. The girl is very kind to Shiny and interested in him after he leaves, and the narrator therefore feels comfortable that she will accept his secret. He tells her and she is shocked into silence until she begins weeping. This, the narrator says, is the only moment he ever feels \\\"absolute regret at being colored\\\". The girl goes away for the summer and they do not have any communication. The narrator is heart-sick. A few months later, he learns she is back in town and they run into each other at the theater. They meet again at another party and there she confesses that she loves him too. The two are married and have two children; unfortunately, the girl dies in the second childbirth. The narrator claims he will never marry again and devotes his life to his children. He expresses ambivalence about his \\\"present position in the world\\\". On the one hand, he is glad he passes as white for his children's sake. On the other hand, he sees prominent African Americans like Booker T. Washington and feels like an insignificant white man who has managed to make some money, a choice which deprived him of standing up for his race. He ends the novel by wondering if \\\"I have chosen the lesser part...I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage\\\". In this section, the narrator travels to Europe and falls in love with Paris. However, he realizes that he needs to get back to his musical career and become a composer. He decides that the best place to do this is in the South, where he can be inspired by the African American music scene. The narrator's confusion and vacillation between being black or white permeates all of his decisions; his ambivalence suggests that he will not ever achieve a hegemonic racial identity. In these last two chapters of the novel, there are multiple depictions of African Americans. The narrator meets the doctor, who the narrator believes represents the best of the race, but back in the South, he is embarrassed by the downtrodden African Americans who populate the streets. He is inspired by the magnetic, impassioned, and authentic personages of Singing Johnson and John Brown, but is disgusted by the absolute debasement of a poor black man who is lynched by a white crowd. In this climactic moment, the anguished narrator comes to the conclusion that he can no longer live openly as a biracial man and that he will be content to pass for white. He decidedly rejects his heritage and embraces a life based on earning money and avoiding the difficulties and indignities that arise from being biracial. It is a willful self-denial seems to haunt him by the end of his story. By the end of the novel, the narrator's goals of making music that represents the traditions of his people and embracing his dual heritage are a distant memory. He is heavy with isolation and remorse. Because the narrator is biracial, he is able to critique both races according to Du Bois's theory of double consciousness. However, he rejects that potential source of power. He is ashamed of his blackness and wants to hide it. The critic Donald Goellnicht writes, \\\"so complete is the obliteration of an African heritage, so complete is the cultural assimilation to Euro-American values, that psychical bondage is obviated; the compliant subject policies himself.\\\" The narrative is destabilized by the inversion of what the reader assumes will occur -the narrator's becoming a \\\"race man\\\", a man like the doctor on the ship. His ultimate choice to pass as white is unpredictable and disappointing to many readers. On the other hand, it is possible to view the narrator's choice to pass as a veritable slap in the face to fixed notions of the racial divide. The narrator has an African American parent but is able to live and make money in a society dominated by white people without their even knowing it. This begs the question - does it even matter that the narrator is half-black? The marriage between the narrator and his wife would have fallen under the category of miscegenation if he revealed his racial background. The mere fact that the narrator chooses to pass as white may be viewed as a profound example of power and autonomy. He is an individual who chooses the path that he believes is right for himself and, later, for his family. Many critics have claimed that the novel is \\\"ironic\\\", but if it is, it is better viewed as a postmodern form of irony that does not rely on a stable referent. The act of \\\"passing\\\" can be held up to this standard as well. Passing implies that a person must be racially homogenous, but most cases do not fall neatly on one side of the racial divide. Passing could be intentional or unintentional; it was not just an imposter trying to cross the color line. As critic Neil Brooks explains, \\\"the physical manifestation of a psychological quest to understand oneself in a society where to be black was often not to have one consistent self, but to have a double self.\\\" The narrator's multiple identities and contradictions end up becoming his identity. He chooses the easier path but as a result, he cannot achieve any closure. This closure is a trope of the modernist reading of literature, but here is precisely why a postmodernist reading is more appropriate: \\\"the narrator has created a world where all is organized around himself, but it can never truly be organized because the self he has placed at the center is as unstable as the external world he seeks to control.\\\" The narrator's lack of a name also underscores his lack of a stable identity. This may indicate that he does not want to be labeled and participate in social classifications. Having always touted himself as the best at whatever he does, his namelessness is one further way for the narrator to overcome society's barriers and achieve material success. The tragedy of his choice is that he can be neither black nor white, and society still propagates arbitrary categorizations that, Brooks writes, \\\"cannot be applied adequately to the personal narratives of its individual members.\\\" Since the narrator never embraces a stable identity, the act of passing becomes that identity. His \\\"freedom from the societal meta-narratives of race\\\" brings with it \\\"the chaos of a disordered universe, which is also central to postmodern theory.\\\" Try as he might, the narrator can never bring closure to his own story. Overall, the novel proffers the idea that ambiguity about race is certainly part of a larger conversation, but that it is ultimately irresolvable.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"\n\nAmong the first of my fellow-passengers of whom I took any particular\nnotice was a tall, broad-shouldered, almost gigantic, colored man.\nHis dark-brown face was clean-shaven; he was well-dressed and bore a\ndecidedly distinguished air. In fact, if he was not handsome, he at\nleast compelled admiration for his fine physical proportions. He\nattracted general attention as he strode the deck in a sort of\nmajestic loneliness. I became curious to know who he was and\ndetermined to strike up an acquaintance with him at the first\nopportune moment. The chance came a day or two later. He was sitting\nin the smoking-room, with a cigar, which had gone out, in his mouth,\nreading a novel. I sat down beside him and, offering him a fresh\ncigar, said: \"You don't mind my telling you something unpleasant, do\nyou?\" He looked at me with a smile, accepted the proffered cigar,\nand replied in a voice which comported perfectly with his size and\nappearance: \"I think my curiosity overcomes any objections I might\nhave.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"have you noticed that the man who sat at your\nright in the saloon during the first meal has not sat there since?\" He\nfrowned slightly without answering my question. \"Well,\" I continued,\n\"he asked the steward to remove him; and not only that, he attempted\nto persuade a number of the passengers to protest against your\npresence in the dining-saloon.\" The big man at my side took a long\ndraw from his cigar, threw his head back, and slowly blew a great\ncloud of smoke toward the ceiling. Then turning to me he said: \"Do you\nknow, I don't object to anyone's having prejudices so long as those\nprejudices don't interfere with my personal liberty. Now, the man you\nare speaking of had a perfect right to change his seat if I in any way\ninterfered with his appetite or his digestion. I should have no reason\nto complain if he removed to the farthest corner of the saloon, or\neven if he got off the ship; but when his prejudice attempts to move\n_me_ one foot, one inch, out of the place where I am comfortably\nlocated, then I object.\" On the word \"object\" he brought his great\nfist down on the table in front of us with such a crash that\neveryone in the room turned to look. We both covered up the slight\nembarrassment with a laugh and strolled out on the deck.\n\nWe walked the deck for an hour or more, discussing different phases\nof the Negro question. In referring to the race I used the personal\npronoun \"we\"; my companion made no comment about it, nor evinced any\nsurprise, except to raise his eyebrows slightly the first time he\ncaught the significance of the word. He was the broadest-minded\ncolored man I have ever talked with on the Negro question. He even\nwent so far as to sympathize with and offer excuses for some white\nSouthern points of view. I asked him what were his main reasons for\nbeing so hopeful. He replied: \"In spite of all that is written, said,\nand done, this great, big, incontrovertible fact stands out--the Negro\nis progressing, and that disproves all the arguments in the world\nthat he is incapable of progress. I was born in slavery, and at\nemancipation was set adrift a ragged, penniless bit of humanity. I\nhave seen the Negro in every grade, and I know what I am talking\nabout. Our detractors point to the increase of crime as evidence\nagainst us; certainly we have progressed in crime as in other things;\nwhat less could be expected? And yet, in this respect, we are far from\nthe point which has been reached by the more highly civilized white\nrace. As we continue to progress, crime among us will gradually lose\nmuch of its brutal, vulgar, I might say healthy, aspect, and become\nmore delicate, refined, and subtle. Then it will be less shocking and\nnoticeable, although more dangerous to society.\" Then dropping his\ntone of irony, he continued with some show of eloquence: \"But, above\nall, when I am discouraged and disheartened, I have this to fall back\non: if there is a principle of right in the world, which finally\nprevails, and I believe that there is; if there is a merciful but\njustice-loving God in heaven, and I believe that there is, we shall\nwin; for we have right on our side, while those who oppose us can\ndefend themselves by nothing in the moral law, nor even by anything in\nthe enlightened thought of the present age.\"\n\nFor several days, together with other topics, we discussed the race\nproblem, not only of the United States, but as it affected native\nAfricans and Jews. Finally, before we reached Boston, our conversation\nhad grown familiar and personal. I had told him something of my past\nand much about my intentions for the future. I learned that he was a\nphysician, a graduate of Howard University, Washington, and had done\npost-graduate work in Philadelphia; and this was his second trip\nabroad to attend professional courses. He had practiced for some years\nin the city of Washington, and though he did not say so, I gathered\nthat his practice was a lucrative one. Before we left the ship, he\nhad made me promise that I would stop two or three days in Washington\nbefore going on south.\n\nWe put up at a hotel in Boston for a couple of days and visited\nseveral of my new friend's acquaintances; they were all people of\neducation and culture and, apparently, of means. I could not help\nbeing struck by the great difference between them and the same class\nof colored people in the South. In speech and thought they were\ngenuine Yankees. The difference was especially noticeable in their\nspeech. There was none of that heavy-tongued enunciation which\ncharacterizes even the best-educated colored people of the South. It\nis remarkable, after all, what an adaptable creature the Negro is.\nI have seen the black West Indian gentleman in London, and he is in\nspeech and manners a perfect Englishman. I have seen natives of Haiti\nand Martinique in Paris, and they are more Frenchy than a Frenchman.\nI have no doubt that the Negro would make a good Chinaman, with\nexception of the pigtail.\n\nMy stay in Washington, instead of being two or three days, was two or\nthree weeks. This was my first visit to the national capital, and\nI was, of course, interested in seeing the public buildings and\nsomething of the working of the government; but most of my time I\nspent with the doctor among his friends and acquaintances. The social\nphase of life among colored people is more developed in Washington\nthan in any other city in the country. This is on account of the large\nnumber of individuals earning good salaries and having a reasonable\namount of leisure time to draw from. There are dozens of physicians\nand lawyers, scores of school teachers, and hundreds of clerks in the\ndepartments. As to the colored department clerks, I think it fair to\nsay that in educational equipment they average above the white clerks\nof the same grade; for, whereas a colored college graduate will seek\nsuch a job, the white university man goes into one of the many higher\nvocations which are open to him.\n\nIn a previous chapter I spoke of social life among colored people; so\nthere is no need to take it up again here. But there is one thing\nI did not mention: among Negroes themselves there is the peculiar\ninconsistency of a color question. Its existence is rarely admitted\nand hardly ever mentioned; it may not be too strong a statement to say\nthat the greater portion of the race is unconscious of its influence;\nyet this influence, though silent, is constant. It is evidenced most\nplainly in marriage selection; thus the black men generally marry\nwomen fairer than themselves; while, on the other hand, the dark\nwomen of stronger mental endowment are very often married to\nlight-complexioned men; the effect is a tendency toward lighter\ncomplexions, especially among the more active elements in the race.\nSome might claim that this is a tacit admission of colored people\namong themselves of their own inferiority judged by the color line. I\ndo not think so. What I have termed an inconsistency is, after all,\nmost natural; it is, in fact, a tendency in accordance with what might\nbe called an economic necessity. So far as racial differences go, the\nUnited States puts a greater premium on color, or, better, lack of\ncolor, than upon anything else in the world. To paraphrase, \"Have a\nwhite skin, and all things else may be added unto you.\" I have seen\nadvertisements in newspapers for waiters, bell-boys, or elevator men,\nwhich read: \"Light-colored man wanted.\" It is this tremendous pressure\nwhich the sentiment of the country exerts that is operating on the\nrace. There is involved not only the question of higher opportunity,\nbut often the question of earning a livelihood; and so I say it is not\nstrange, but a natural tendency. Nor is it any more a sacrifice of\nself-respect that a black man should give to his children every\nadvantage he can which complexion of the skin carries than that the\nnew or vulgar rich should purchase for their children the advantages\nwhich ancestry, aristocracy, and social position carry. I once heard a\ncolored man sum it up in these words: \"It's no disgrace to be black,\nbut it's often very inconvenient.\"\n\nWashington shows the Negro not only at his best, but also at his\nworst. As I drove around with the doctor, he commented rather harshly\non those of the latter class which we saw. He remarked: \"You see those\nlazy, loafing, good-for-nothing darkies; they're not worth digging\ngraves for; yet they are the ones who create impressions of the race\nfor the casual observer. It's because they are always in evidence on\nthe street corners, while the rest of us are hard at work, and\nyou know a dozen loafing darkies make a bigger crowd and a worse\nimpression in this country than fifty white men of the same class. But\nthey ought not to represent the race. We are the race, and the race\nought to be judged by us, not by them. Every race and every nation\nshould be judged by the best it has been able to produce, not by the\nworst.\"\n\nThe recollection of my stay in Washington is a pleasure to me now.\nIn company with the doctor I visited Howard University, the public\nschools, the excellent colored hospital, with which he was in some\nway connected, if I remember correctly, and many comfortable and even\nelegant homes. It was with some reluctance that I continued my journey\nsouth. The doctor was very kind in giving me letters to people in\nRichmond and Nashville when I told him that I intended to stop in\nboth of these cities. In Richmond a man who was then editing a very\ncreditable colored newspaper gave me a great deal of his time and made\nmy stay there of three or four days very pleasant. In Nashville\nI spent a whole day at Fisk University, the home of the \"Jubilee\nSingers,\" and was more than repaid for my time. Among my letters of\nintroduction was one to a very prosperous physician. He drove me about\nthe city and introduced me to a number of people. From Nashville I\nwent to Atlanta, where I stayed long enough to gratify an old desire\nto see Atlanta University again. I then continued my journey to Macon.\n\nDuring the trip from Nashville to Atlanta I went into the\nsmoking-compartment of the car to smoke a cigar. I was traveling in a\nPullman, not because of an abundance of funds, but because through my\nexperience with my millionaire a certain amount of comfort and luxury\nhad become a necessity to me whenever it was obtainable. When I\nentered the car, I found only a couple of men there; but in a\nhalf-hour there were half a dozen or more. From the general\nconversation I learned that a fat Jewish-looking man was a cigar\nmanufacturer, and was experimenting in growing Havana tobacco in\nFlorida; that a slender bespectacled young man was from Ohio and\na professor in some State institution in Alabama; that a\nwhite-mustached, well-dressed man was an old Union soldier who had\nfought through the Civil War; and that a tall, raw-boned, red-faced\nman, who seemed bent on leaving nobody in ignorance of the fact that\nhe was from Texas, was a cotton planter.\n\nIn the North men may ride together for hours in a \"smoker\" and unless\nthey are acquainted with each other never exchange a word; in the\nSouth men thrown together in such manner are friends in fifteen\nminutes. There is always present a warm-hearted cordiality which will\nmelt down the most frigid reserve. It may be because Southerners are\nvery much like Frenchmen in that they must talk; and not only must\nthey talk, but they must express their opinions.\n\nThe talk in the car was for a while miscellaneous--on the weather,\ncrops, business prospects; the old Union soldier had invested capital\nin Atlanta, and he predicted that that city would soon be one of the\ngreatest in the country. Finally the conversation drifted to politics;\nthen, as a natural sequence, turned upon the Negro question.\n\nIn the discussion of the race question the diplomacy of the Jew was\nsomething to be admired; he had the faculty of agreeing with everybody\nwithout losing his allegiance to any side. He knew that to sanction\nNegro oppression would be to sanction Jewish oppression and would\nexpose him to a shot along that line from the old soldier, who stood\nfirmly on the ground of equal rights and opportunity to all men; long\ntraditions and business instincts told him when in Rome to act as a\nRoman. Altogether his position was a delicate one, and I gave him\ncredit for the skill he displayed in maintaining it. The young\nprofessor was apologetic. He had had the same views as the G.A.R. man;\nbut a year in the South had opened his eyes, and he had to confess\nthat the problem could hardly be handled any better than it was being\nhandled by the Southern whites. To which the G.A.R. man responded\nsomewhat rudely that he had spent ten times as many years in the South\nas his young friend and that he could easily understand how holding a\nposition in a State institution in Alabama would bring about a change\nof views. The professor turned very red and had very little more to\nsay. The Texan was fierce, eloquent, and profane in his argument, and,\nin a lower sense, there was a direct logic in what he said, which was\nconvincing; it was only by taking higher ground, by dealing in what\nSoutherners call \"theories,\" that he could be combated. Occasionally\nsome one of the several other men in the \"smoker\" would throw in a\nremark to reinforce what he said, but he really didn't need any help;\nhe was sufficient in himself.\n\nIn the course of a short time the controversy narrowed itself down\nto an argument between the old soldier and the Texan. The latter\nmaintained hotly that the Civil War was a criminal mistake on the part\nof the North and that the humiliation which the South suffered during\nReconstruction could never be forgotten. The Union man retorted just\nas hotly that the South was responsible for the war and that the\nspirit of unforgetfulness on its part was the greatest cause of\npresent friction; that it seemed to be the one great aim of the South\nto convince the North that the latter made a mistake in fighting to\npreserve the Union and liberate the slaves. \"Can you imagine,\" he went\non to say, \"what would have been the condition of things eventually if\nthere had been no war, and the South had been allowed to follow its\ncourse? Instead of one great, prosperous country with nothing before\nit but the conquests of peace, a score of petty republics, as in\nCentral and South America, wasting their energies in war with each\nother or in revolutions.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the Texan, \"anything--no country at all--is better\nthan having niggers over you. But anyhow, the war was fought and the\nniggers were freed; for it's no use beating around the bush, the\nniggers, and not the Union, was the cause of it; and now do you\nbelieve that all the niggers on earth are worth the good white blood\nthat was spilt? You freed the nigger and you gave him the ballot, but\nyou couldn't make a citizen out of him. He don't know what he's voting\nfor, and we buy 'em like so many hogs. You're giving 'em education,\nbut that only makes slick rascals out of 'em.\"\n\n\"Don't fancy for a moment,\" said the Northern man, \"that you have any\nmonopoly in buying ignorant votes. The same thing is done on a larger\nscale in New York and Boston, and in Chicago and San Francisco; and\nthey are not black votes either. As to education's making the Negro\nworse, you might just as well tell me that religion does the same\nthing. And, by the way, how many educated colored men do you know\npersonally?\"\n\nThe Texan admitted that he knew only one, and added that he was in\nthe penitentiary. \"But,\" he said, \"do you mean to claim, ballot or\nno ballot, education or no education, that niggers are the equals of\nwhite men?\"\n\n\"That's not the question,\" answered the other, \"but if the Negro is so\ndistinctly inferior, it is a strange thing to me that it takes such\ntremendous effort on the part of the white man to make him realize it,\nand to keep him in the same place into which inferior men naturally\nfall. However, let us grant for sake of argument that the Negro is\ninferior in every respect to the white man; that fact only increases\nour moral responsibility in regard to our actions toward him.\nInequalities of numbers, wealth, and power, even of intelligence and\nmorals, should make no difference in the essential rights of men.\"\n\n\"If he's inferior and weaker, and is shoved to the wall, that's his\nown look-out,\" said the Texan. \"That's the law of nature; and he's\nbound to go to the wall; for no race in the world has ever been able\nto stand competition with the Anglo-Saxon. The Anglo-Saxon race has\nalways been and always will be the masters of the world, and the\nniggers in the South ain't going to change all the records of\nhistory.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said the old soldier slowly, \"if you have studied\nhistory, will you tell me, as confidentially between white men, what\nthe Anglo-Saxon has ever done?\"\n\nThe Texan was too much astonished by the question to venture any\nreply.\n\nHis opponent continued: \"Can you name a single one of the great\nfundamental and original intellectual achievements which have\nraised man in the scale of civilization that may be credited to the\nAnglo-Saxon? The art of letters, of poetry, of music, of sculpture, of\npainting, of the drama, of architecture; the science of mathematics,\nof astronomy, of philosophy, of logic, of physics, of chemistry, the\nuse of the metals, and the principles of mechanics, were all invented\nor discovered by darker and what we now call inferior races and\nnations. We have carried many of these to their highest point of\nperfection, but the foundation was laid by others. Do you know the\nonly original contribution to civilization we can claim is what we\nhave done in steam and electricity and in making implements of war\nmore deadly? And there we worked largely on principles which we did\nnot discover. Why, we didn't even originate the religion we use. We\nare a great race, the greatest in the world today, but we ought to\nremember that we are standing on a pile of past races, and enjoy our\nposition with a little less show of arrogance. We are simply having\nour turn at the game, and we were a long time getting to it. After\nall, racial supremacy is merely a matter of dates in history. The man\nhere who belongs to what is, all in all, the greatest race the world\never produced, is almost ashamed to own it. If the Anglo-Saxon is\nthe source of everything good and great in the human race from\nthe beginning, why wasn't the German forest the birthplace of\ncivilization, rather than the valley of the Nile?\"\n\nThe Texan was somewhat disconcerted, for the argument had passed a\nlittle beyond his limits, but he swung it back to where he was sure of\nhis ground by saying: \"All that may be true, but it hasn't got much to\ndo with us and the niggers here in the South. We've got 'em here,\nand we've got 'em to live with, and it's a question of white man or\nnigger, no middle ground. You want us to treat niggers as equals. Do\nyou want to see 'em sitting around in our parlors? Do you want to see\na mulatto South? To bring it right home to you, would you let your\ndaughter marry a nigger?\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't consent to my daughter's marrying a nigger, but that\ndoesn't prevent my treating a black man fairly. And I don't see what\nfair treatment has to do with niggers sitting around in your parlors;\nthey can't come there unless they're invited. Out of all the white men\nI know, only a hundred or so have the privilege of sitting around in\nmy parlor. As to the mulatto South, if you Southerners have one boast\nthat is stronger than another, it is your women; you put them on a\npinnacle of purity and virtue and bow down in a chivalric worship\nbefore them; yet you talk and act as though, should you treat the\nNegro fairly and take the anti-inter-marriage laws off your statute\nbooks, these same women would rush into the arms of black lovers and\nhusbands. It's a wonder to me that they don't rise up and resent the\ninsult.\"\n\n\"Colonel,\" said the Texan, as he reached into his handbag and brought\nout a large flask of whisky, \"you might argue from now until hell\nfreezes over, and you might convince me that you're right, but you'll\nnever convince me that I'm wrong. All you say sounds very good, but\nit's got nothing to do with facts. You can say what men ought to be,\nbut they ain't that; so there you are. Down here in the South we're up\nagainst facts, and we're meeting 'em like facts. We don't believe the\nnigger is or ever will be the equal of the white man, and we ain't\ngoing to treat him as an equal; I'll be damned if we will. Have a\ndrink.\" Everybody except the professor partook of the generous Texan's\nflask, and the argument closed in a general laugh and good feeling.\n\nI went back into the main part of the car with the conversation on my\nmind. Here I had before me the bald, raw, naked aspects of the race\nquestion in the South; and, in consideration of the step I was just\ntaking, it was far from encouraging. The sentiments of the Texan--and\nhe expressed the sentiments of the South--fell upon me like a chill. I\nwas sick at heart. Yet I must confess that underneath it all I felt a\ncertain sort of admiration for the man who could not be swayed from\nwhat he held as his principles. Contrasted with him, the young Ohio\nprofessor was indeed a pitiable character. And all along, in spite of\nmyself, I have been compelled to accord the same kind of admiration to\nthe Southern white man for the manner in which he defends not only his\nvirtues, but his vices. He knows that, judged by a high standard, he\nis narrow and prejudiced, that he is guilty of unfairness, oppression,\nand cruelty, but this he defends as stoutly as he would his better\nqualities. This same spirit obtains in a great degree among the\nblacks; they, too, defend their faults and failings. This they\ngenerally do whenever white people are concerned. And yet among\nthemselves they are their own most merciless critics. I have never\nheard the race so terribly arraigned as I have by colored speakers to\nstrictly colored audiences. It is the spirit of the South to defend\neverything belonging to it. The North is too cosmopolitan and tolerant\nfor such a spirit. If you should say to an Easterner that Paris is a\ngayer city than New York, he would be likely to agree with you, or\nat least to let you have your own way; but to suggest to a South\nCarolinian that Boston is a nicer city to live in than Charleston\nwould be to stir his greatest depths of argument and eloquence.\n\nBut to-day, as I think over that smoking-car argument, I can see it\nin a different light. The Texan's position does not render things\nso hopeless, for it indicates that the main difficulty of the race\nquestion does not lie so much in the actual condition of the blacks as\nit does in the mental attitude of the whites; and a mental attitude,\nespecially one not based on truth, can be changed more easily than\nactual conditions. That is to say, the burden of the question is not\nthat the whites are struggling to save ten million despondent and\nmoribund people from sinking into a hopeless slough of ignorance,\npoverty, and barbarity in their very midst, but that they are\nunwilling to open certain doors of opportunity and to accord certain\ntreatment to ten million aspiring, education-and-property-acquiring\npeople. In a word, the difficulty of the problem is not so much due to\nthe facts presented as to the hypothesis assumed for its solution. In\nthis it is similar to the problem of the solar system. By a complex,\nconfusing, and almost contradictory mathematical process, by the use\nof zigzags instead of straight lines, the earth can be proved to be\nthe center of things celestial; but by an operation so simple that it\ncan be comprehended by a schoolboy, its position can be verified\namong the other worlds which revolve about the sun, and its movements\nharmonized with the laws of the universe. So, when the white race\nassumes as a hypothesis that it is the main object of creation and\nthat all things else are merely subsidiary to its well-being,\nsophism, subterfuge, perversion of conscience, arrogance, injustice,\noppression, cruelty, sacrifice of human blood, all are required to\nmaintain the position, and its dealings with other races become\nindeed a problem, a problem which, if based on a hypothesis of common\nhumanity, could be solved by the simple rules of justice.\n\nWhen I reached Macon, I decided to leave my trunk and all my surplus\nbelongings, to pack my bag, and strike out into the interior. This\nI did; and by train, by mule and ox-cart, I traveled through many\ncounties. This was my first real experience among rural colored\npeople, and all that I saw was interesting to me; but there was a\ngreat deal which does not require description at my hands; for log\ncabins and plantations and dialect-speaking \"darkies\" are perhaps\nbetter known in American literature than any other single picture of\nour national life. Indeed, they form an ideal and exclusive literary\nconcept of the American Negro to such an extent that it is almost\nimpossible to get the reading public to recognize him in any other\nsetting; so I shall endeavor to avoid giving the reader any already\noverworked and hackneyed descriptions. This generally accepted\nliterary ideal of the American Negro constitutes what is really an\nobstacle in the way of the thoughtful and progressive element of\nthe race. His character has been established as a happy-go-lucky,\nlaughing, shuffling, banjo-picking being, and the reading public has\nnot yet been prevailed upon to take him seriously. His efforts\nto elevate himself socially are looked upon as a sort of absurd\ncaricature of \"white civilization.\" A novel dealing with colored\npeople who lived in respectable homes and amidst a fair degree of\nculture and who naturally acted \"just like white folks\" would be taken\nin a comic-opera sense. In this respect the Negro is much in the\nposition of a great comedian who gives up the lighter roles to play\ntragedy. No matter how well he may portray the deeper passions,\nthe public is loath to give him up in his old character; they even\nconspire to make him a failure in serious work, in order to force him\nback into comedy. In the same respect, the public is not too much\nto be blamed, for great comedians are far more scarce than mediocre\ntragedians; every amateur actor is a tragedian. However, this very\nfact constitutes the opportunity of the future Negro novelist and poet\nto give the country something new and unknown, in depicting the life,\nthe ambitions, the struggles, and the passions of those of their race\nwho are striving to break the narrow limits of traditions. A beginning\nhas already been made in that remarkable book by Dr. Du Bois, _The\nSouls of Black Folk_.\n\nMuch, too, that I saw while on this trip, in spite of my enthusiasm,\nwas disheartening. Often I thought of what my millionaire had said to\nme, and wished myself back in Europe. The houses in which I had to\nstay were generally uncomfortable, sometimes worse. I often had to\nsleep in a division or compartment with several other people. Once or\ntwice I was not so fortunate as to find divisions; everybody slept\non pallets on the floor. Frequently I was able to lie down and\ncontemplate the stars which were in their zenith. The food was at\ntimes so distasteful and poorly cooked that I could not eat it. I\nremember that once I lived for a week or more on buttermilk, on\naccount of not being able to stomach the fat bacon, the rank\nturnip-tops, and the heavy damp mixture of meal, salt, and water which\nwas called corn bread. It was only my ambition to do the work which I\nhad planned that kept me steadfast to my purpose. Occasionally I would\nmeet with some signs of progress and uplift in even one of these\nback-wood settlements--houses built of boards, with windows, and\ndivided into rooms; decent food, and a fair standard of living. This\ncondition was due to the fact that there was in the community some\nexceptionally capable Negro farmer whose thrift served as an example.\nAs I went about among these dull, simple people--the great majority\nof them hard working, in their relations with the whites submissive,\nfaithful, and often affectionate, negatively content with their\nlot--and contrasted them with those of the race who had been quickened\nby the forces of thought, I could not but appreciate the logic of the\nposition held by those Southern leaders who have been bold enough to\nproclaim against the education of the Negro. They are consistent in\ntheir public speech with Southern sentiment and desires. Those public\nmen of the South who have not been daring or heedless enough to\ndefy the ideals of twentieth-century civilization and of modern\nhumanitarianism and philanthropy, find themselves in the embarrassing\nsituation of preaching one thing and praying for another. They are in\nthe position of the fashionable woman who is compelled by the laws of\npolite society to say to her dearest enemy: \"How happy I am to see\nyou!\"\n\nAnd yet in this respect how perplexing is Southern character; for, in\nopposition to the above, it may be said that the claim of the Southern\nwhites that they love the Negro better than the Northern whites do is\nin a manner true. Northern white people love the Negro in a sort of\nabstract way, as a race; through a sense of justice, charity, and\nphilanthropy, they will liberally assist in his elevation. A number of\nthem have heroically spent their lives in this effort (and just here I\nwish to say that when the colored people reach the monument-building\nstage, they should not forget the men and women who went South after\nthe war and founded schools for them). Yet, generally speaking, they\nhave no particular liking for individuals of the race. Southern white\npeople despise the Negro as a race, and will do nothing to aid in his\nelevation as such; but for certain individuals they have a strong\naffection, and are helpful to them in many ways. With these individual\nmembers of the race they live on terms of the greatest intimacy; they\nentrust to them their children, their family treasures, and their\nfamily secrets; in trouble they often go to them for comfort\nand counsel; in sickness they often rely upon their care. This\naffectionate relation between the Southern whites and those blacks\nwho come into close touch with them has not been overdrawn even in\nfiction.\n\nThis perplexity of Southern character extends even to the intermixture\nof the races. That is spoken of as though it were dreaded worse than\nsmallpox, leprosy, or the plague. Yet, when I was in Jacksonville, I\nknew several prominent families there with large colored branches,\nwhich went by the same name and were known and acknowledged as blood\nrelatives. And what is more, there seemed to exist between these\nblack brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts a decidedly friendly\nfeeling.\n\nI said above that Southern whites would do nothing for the Negro as\na race. I know the South claims that it has spent millions for\nthe education of the blacks, and that it has of its own free will\nshouldered this awful burden. It seems to be forgetful of the fact\nthat these millions have been taken from the public tax funds for\neducation, and that the law of political economy which recognizes the\nland owner as the one who really pays the taxes is not tenable. It\nwould be just as reasonable for the relatively few land owners of\nManhattan to complain that they had to stand the financial burden of\nthe education of the thousands and thousands of children whose parents\npay rent for tenements and flats. Let the millions of producing and\nconsuming Negroes be taken out of the South, and it would be quickly\nseen how much less of public funds there would be to appropriate for\neducation or any other purpose.\n\nIn thus traveling about through the country I was sometimes amused\non arriving at some little railroad-station town to be taken for and\ntreated as a white man, and six hours later, when it was learned that\nI was stopping at the house of the colored preacher or school teacher,\nto note the attitude of the whole town change. At times this led even\nto embarrassment. Yet it cannot be so embarrassing for a colored man\nto be taken for white as for a white man to be taken for colored; and\nI have heard of several cases of the latter kind.\n\nAll this while I was gathering material for work, jotting down in my\nnote-book themes and melodies, and trying to catch the spirit of the\nNegro in his relatively primitive state. I began to feel the necessity\nof hurrying so that I might get back to some city like Nashville to\nbegin my compositions and at the same time earn at least a living\nby teaching and performing before my funds gave out. At the last\nsettlement in which I stopped I found a mine of material. This was due\nto the fact that \"big meeting\" was in progress. \"Big meeting\" is an\ninstitution something like camp-meeting, the difference being that it\nis held in a permanent church, and not in a temporary structure. All\nthe churches of some one denomination--of course, either Methodist or\nBaptist--in a county, or, perhaps, in several adjoining counties, are\nclosed, and the congregations unite at some centrally located church\nfor a series of meetings lasting a week. It is really a social as well\nas a religious function. The people come in great numbers, making the\ntrip, according to their financial status, in buggies drawn by sleek,\nfleet-footed mules, in ox-carts, or on foot. It was amusing to see\nsome of the latter class trudging down the hot and dusty road, with\ntheir shoes, which were brand-new, strung across their shoulders. When\nthey got near the church, they sat on the side of the road and, with\nmany grimaces, tenderly packed their feet into those instruments of\ntorture. This furnished, indeed, a trying test of their religion. The\nfamous preachers come from near and far and take turns in warning\nsinners of the day of wrath. Food, in the form of those two Southern\nluxuries, fried chicken and roast pork, is plentiful, and no one need\ngo hungry. On the opening Sunday the women are immaculate in starched\nstiff white dresses adorned with ribbons, either red or blue. Even a\ngreat many of the men wear streamers of vari-colored ribbons in the\nbuttonholes of their coats. A few of them carefully cultivate a\nforelock of hair by wrapping it in twine, and on such festive\noccasions decorate it with a narrow ribbon streamer. Big meetings\nafford a fine opportunity to the younger people to meet each other\ndressed in their Sunday clothes, and much rustic courting, which is as\nenjoyable as any other kind, is indulged in.\n\nThis big meeting which I was lucky enough to catch was particularly\nwell attended; the extra large attendance was due principally to two\nattractions, a man by the name of John Brown, who was renowned as the\nmost powerful preacher for miles around; and a wonderful leader of\nsinging, who was known as \"Singing Johnson.\" These two men were a\nstudy and a revelation to me. They caused me to reflect upon how great\nan influence their types have been in the development of the Negro\nin America. Both these types are now looked upon generally with\ncondescension or contempt by the progressive element among the colored\npeople; but it should never be forgotten that it was they who led the\nrace from paganism and kept it steadfast to Christianity through all\nthe long, dark years of slavery.\n\nJohn Brown was a jet-black man of medium size, with a strikingly\nintelligent head and face, and a voice like an organ peal. He preached\neach night after several lesser lights had successively held the\npulpit during an hour or so. As far as subject-matter is concerned,\nall of the sermons were alike: each began with the fall of man, ran\nthrough various trials and tribulations of the Hebrew children, on\nto the redemption by Christ, and ended with a fervid picture of the\njudgment day and the fate of the damned. But John Brown possessed\nmagnetism and an imagination so free and daring that he was able to\ncarry through what the other preachers would not attempt. He knew all\nthe arts and tricks of oratory, the modulation of the voice to almost\na whisper, the pause for effect, the rise through light, rapid-fire\nsentences to the terrific, thundering outburst of an electrifying\nclimax. In addition, he had the intuition of a born theatrical\nmanager. Night after night this man held me fascinated. He convinced\nme that, after all, eloquence consists more in the manner of saying\nthan in what is said. It is largely a matter of tone pictures.\n\nThe most striking example of John Brown's magnetism and imagination\nwas his \"heavenly march\"; I shall never forget how it impressed\nme when I heard it. He opened his sermon in the usual way; then,\nproclaiming to his listeners that he was going to take them on the\nheavenly march, he seized the Bible under his arm and began to pace up\nand down the pulpit platform. The congregation immediately began with\ntheir feet a tramp, tramp, tramp, in time with the preacher's march\nin the pulpit, all the while singing in an undertone a hymn about\nmarching to Zion. Suddenly he cried: \"Halt!\" Every foot stopped with\nthe precision of a company of well-drilled soldiers, and the singing\nceased. The morning star had been reached. Here the preacher described\nthe beauties of that celestial body. Then the march, the tramp, tramp,\ntramp, and the singing were again taken up. Another \"Halt!\" They\nhad reached the evening star. And so on, past the sun and moon--the\nintensity of religious emotion all the time increasing--along the\nmilky way, on up to the gates of heaven. Here the halt was longer,\nand the preacher described at length the gates and walls of the New\nJerusalem. Then he took his hearers through the pearly gates, along\nthe golden streets, pointing out the glories of the city, pausing\noccasionally to greet some patriarchal members of the church,\nwell-known to most of his listeners in life, who had had \"the tears\nwiped from their eyes, were clad in robes of spotless white, with\ncrowns of gold upon their heads and harps within their hands,\" and\nended his march before the great white throne. To the reader this may\nsound ridiculous, but listened to under the circumstances, it was\nhighly and effectively dramatic. I was a more or less sophisticated\nand non-religious man of the world, but the torrent of the preacher's\nwords, moving with the rhythm and glowing with the eloquence of\nprimitive poetry, swept me along, and I, too, felt like joining in the\nshouts of \"Amen! Hallelujah!\"\n\nJohn Brown's powers in describing the delights of heaven were no\ngreater than those in depicting the horrors of hell. I saw great,\nstrapping fellows trembling and weeping like children at the\n\"mourners' bench.\" His warnings to sinners were truly terrible. I\nshall never forget one expression that he used, which for originality\nand aptness could not be excelled. In my opinion, it is more graphic\nand, for us, far more expressive than St. Paul's \"It is hard to\nkick against the pricks.\" He struck the attitude of a pugilist and\nthundered out: \"Young man, your arm's too short to box with God!\"\n\nInteresting as was John Brown to me, the other man, \"Singing Johnson,\"\nwas more so. He was a small, dark-brown, one-eyed man, with a clear,\nstrong, high-pitched voice, a leader of singing, a maker of songs, a\nman who could improvise at the moment lines to fit the occasion. Not\nso striking a figure as John Brown, but, at \"big meetings,\" equally\nimportant. It is indispensable to the success of the singing, when\nthe congregation is a large one made up of people from different\ncommunities, to have someone with a strong voice who knows just what\nhymn to sing and when to sing it, who can pitch it in the right key,\nand who has all the leading lines committed to memory. Sometimes it\ndevolves upon the leader to \"sing down\" a long-winded or uninteresting\nspeaker. Committing to memory the leading lines of all the Negro\nspiritual songs is no easy task, for they run up into the hundreds.\nBut the accomplished leader must know them all, because the\ncongregation sings only the refrains and repeats; every ear in the\nchurch is fixed upon him, and if he becomes mixed in his lines or\nforgets them, the responsibility falls directly on his shoulders.\n\nFor example, most of these hymns are constructed to be sung in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n  Leader. _Swing low, sweet chariot._\n  Congregation. _Coming for to carry me home._\n  Leader. _Swing low, sweet chariot._\n  Congregation. _Coming for to carry me home._\n  Leader. _I look over yonder, what do I see?_\n  Congregation. _Coming for to carry me home._\n  Leader. _Two little angels coming after me._\n  Congregation. _Coming for to carry me home...._\n\nThe solitary and plaintive voice of the leader is answered by a sound\nlike the roll of the sea, producing a most curious effect.\n\nIn only a few of these songs do the leader and the congregation start\noff together. Such a song is the well-known \"Steal away to Jesus.\"\n\nThe leader and the congregation begin with part-singing:\n\n  _Steal away, steal away,\n  Steal away to Jesus;\n  Steal away, steal away home,\n  I ain't got long to stay here._\n\nThen the leader alone or the congregation in unison:\n\n  _My Lord he calls me,\n  He calls me by the thunder,\n  The trumpet sounds within-a my soul._\n\nThen all together:\n\n  _I ain't got long to stay here._\n\nThe leader and the congregation again take up the opening refrain;\nthen the leader sings three more leading lines alone, and so on almost\n_ad infinitum_. It will be seen that even here most of the work falls\nupon the leader, for the congregation sings the same lines over and\nover, while his memory and ingenuity are taxed to keep the songs\ngoing.\n\nGenerally the parts taken up by the congregation are sung in a\nthree-part harmony, the women singing the soprano and a transposed\ntenor, the men with high voices singing the melody, and those with\nlow voices a thundering bass. In a few of these songs, however, the\nleading part is sung in unison by the whole congregation, down to\nthe last line, which is harmonized. The effect of this is intensely\nthrilling. Such a hymn is \"Go down, Moses.\" It stirs the heart like a\ntrumpet call.\n\n\"Singing Johnson\" was an ideal leader, and his services were in great\ndemand. He spent his time going about the country from one church\nto another. He received his support in much the same way as the\npreachers--part of a collection, food and lodging. All of his leisure\ntime he devoted to originating new words and melodies and new lines\nfor old songs. He always sang with his eyes--or, to be more exact, his\neye--closed, indicating the _tempo_ by swinging his head to and fro.\nHe was a great judge of the proper hymn to sing at a particular\nmoment; and I noticed several times, when the preacher reached a\ncertain climax, or expressed a certain sentiment, that Johnson broke\nin with a line or two of some appropriate hymn. The speaker understood\nand would pause until the singing ceased.\n\nAs I listened to the singing of these songs, the wonder of their\nproduction grew upon me more and more. How did the men who originated\nthem manage to do it? The sentiments are easily accounted for; they\nare mostly taken from the Bible; but the melodies, where did they come\nfrom? Some of them so weirdly sweet, and others so wonderfully strong.\nTake, for instance, \"Go down, Moses.\" I doubt that there is a stronger\ntheme in the whole musical literature of the world. And so many of\nthese songs contain more than mere melody; there is sounded in them\nthat elusive undertone, the note in music which is not heard with the\nears. I sat often with the tears rolling down my cheeks and my heart\nmelted within me. Any musical person who has never heard a Negro\ncongregation under the spell of religious fervor sing these old songs\nhas missed one of the most thrilling emotions which the human heart\nmay experience. Anyone who without shedding tears can listen to\nNegroes sing \"Nobody knows de trouble I see, Nobody knows but Jesus\"\nmust indeed have a heart of stone.\n\nAs yet, the Negroes themselves do not fully appreciate these old slave\nsongs. The educated classes are rather ashamed of them and prefer to\nsing hymns from books. This feeling is natural; they are still too\nclose to the conditions under which the songs were produced; but\nthe day will come when this slave music will be the most treasured\nheritage of the American Negro.\n\nAt the close of the \"big meeting\" I left the settlement where it was\nbeing held, full of enthusiasm. I was in that frame of mind which, in\nthe artistic temperament, amounts to inspiration. I was now ready and\nanxious to get to some place where I might settle down to work, and\ngive expression to the ideas which were teeming in my head; but I\nstrayed into another deviation from my path of life as I had it marked\nout, which led me upon an entirely different road. Instead of going\nto the nearest and most convenient railroad station, I accepted the\ninvitation of a young man who had been present the closing Sunday at\nthe meeting to drive with him some miles farther to the town in which\nhe taught school, and there take the train. My conversation with\nthis young man as we drove along through the country was\nextremely interesting. He had been a student in one of the Negro\ncolleges--strange coincidence, in the very college, as I learned\nthrough him, in which \"Shiny\" was now a professor. I was, of course,\ncurious to hear about my boyhood friend; and had it not been vacation\ntime, and that I was not sure that I should find him, I should have\ngone out of my way to pay him a visit; but I determined to write to\nhim as soon as the school opened. My companion talked to me about his\nwork among the people, of his hopes and his discouragements. He was\ntremendously in earnest; I might say, too much so. In fact, it may\nbe said that the majority of intelligent colored people are, in some\ndegree, too much in earnest over the race question. They assume and\ncarry so much that their progress is at times impeded and they are\nunable to see things in their proper proportions. In many instances a\nslight exercise of the sense of humor would save much anxiety of soul.\nAnyone who marks the general tone of editorials in colored newspapers\nis apt to be impressed with this idea. If the mass of Negroes took\ntheir present and future as seriously as do the most of their leaders,\nthe race would be in no mental condition to sustain the terrible\npressure which it undergoes; it would sink of its own weight. Yet it\nmust be acknowledged that in the making of a race overseriousness is\na far lesser failing than its reverse, and even the faults resulting\nfrom it lean toward the right.\n\nWe drove into the town just before dark. As we passed a large,\nunpainted church, my companion pointed it out as the place where he\nheld his school. I promised that I would go there with him the next\nmorning and visit awhile. The town was of that kind which hardly\nrequires or deserves description; a straggling line of brick and\nwooden stores on one side of the railroad track and some cottages of\nvarious sizes on the other side constituted about the whole of it. The\nyoung school teacher boarded at the best house in the place owned by\na colored man. It was painted, had glass windows, contained \"store\nbought\" furniture, an organ, and lamps with chimneys. The owner held a\njob of some kind on the railroad. After supper it was not long before\neverybody was sleepy. I occupied the room with the school teacher. In\na few minutes after we got into the room he was in bed and asleep; but\nI took advantage of the unusual luxury of a lamp which gave light, and\nsat looking over my notes and jotting down some ideas which were still\nfresh in my mind. Suddenly I became conscious of that sense of alarm\nwhich is always aroused by the sound of hurrying footsteps on the\nsilence of the night. I stopped work and looked at my watch. It was\nafter eleven. I listened, straining every nerve to hear above the\ntumult of my quickening pulse. I caught the murmur of voices, then\nthe gallop of a horse, then of another and another. Now thoroughly\nalarmed, I woke my companion, and together we both listened. After a\nmoment he put out the light and softly opened the window-blind, and we\ncautiously peeped out. We saw men moving in one direction, and from\nthe mutterings we vaguely caught the rumor that some terrible crime\nhad been committed. I put on my coat and hat. My friend did all in his\npower to dissuade me from venturing out, but it was impossible for me\nto remain in the house under such tense excitement. My nerves would\nnot have stood it. Perhaps what bravery I exercised in going out was\ndue to the fact that I felt sure my identity as a colored man had not\nyet become known in the town.\n\nI went out and, following the drift, reached the railroad station.\nThere was gathered there a crowd of men, all white, and others were\nsteadily arriving, seemingly from all the surrounding country. How\ndid the news spread so quickly? I watched these men moving under\nthe yellow glare of the kerosene lamps about the station, stern,\ncomparatively silent, all of them armed, some of them in boots and\nspurs; fierce, determined men. I had come to know the type well,\nblond, tall, and lean, with ragged mustache and beard, and glittering\ngray eyes. At the first suggestion of daylight they began to disperse\nin groups, going in several directions. There was no extra noise or\nexcitement, no loud talking, only swift, sharp words of command given\nby those who seemed to be accepted as leaders by mutual understanding.\nIn fact, the impression made upon me was that everything was being\ndone in quite an orderly manner. In spite of so many leaving, the\ncrowd around the station continued to grow; at sunrise there were\na great many women and children. By this time I also noticed some\ncolored people; a few seemed to be going about customary tasks;\nseveral were standing on the outskirts of the crowd; but the gathering\nof Negroes usually seen in such towns was missing.\n\nBefore noon they brought him in. Two horsemen rode abreast; between\nthem, half dragged, the poor wretch made his way through the dust. His\nhands were tied behind him, and ropes around his body were fastened to\nthe saddle horns of his double guard. The men who at midnight had been\nstern and silent were now emitting that terror-instilling sound known\nas the \"rebel yell.\" A space was quickly cleared in the crowd, and a\nrope placed about his neck, when from somewhere came the suggestion,\n\"Burn him!\" It ran like an electric current. Have you ever witnessed\nthe transformation of human beings into savage beasts? Nothing can be\nmore terrible. A railroad tie was sunk into the ground, the rope was\nremoved, and a chain brought and securely coiled around the victim and\nthe stake. There he stood, a man only in form and stature, every sign\nof degeneracy stamped upon his countenance. His eyes were dull\nand vacant, indicating not a single ray of thought. Evidently the\nrealization of his fearful fate had robbed him of whatever reasoning\npower he had ever possessed. He was too stunned and stupefied even to\ntremble. Fuel was brought from everywhere, oil, the torch; the flames\ncrouched for an instant as though to gather strength, then leaped up\nas high as their victim's head. He squirmed, he writhed, strained at\nhis chains, then gave out cries and groans that I shall always hear.\nThe cries and groans were choked off by the fire and smoke; but his\neyes, bulging from their sockets, rolled from side to side, appealing\nin vain for help. Some of the crowd yelled and cheered, others seemed\nappalled at what they had done, and there were those who turned\naway sickened at the sight. I was fixed to the spot where I stood,\npowerless to take my eyes from what I did not want to see.\n\nIt was over before I realized that time had elapsed. Before I could\nmake myself believe that what I saw was really happening, I was\nlooking at a scorched post, a smoldering fire, blackened bones,\ncharred fragments sifting down through coils of chain; and the smell\nof burnt flesh--human flesh--was in my nostrils.\n\nI walked a short distance away and sat down in order to clear my dazed\nmind. A great wave of humiliation and shame swept over me. Shame that\nI belonged to a race that could be so dealt with; and shame for my\ncountry, that it, the great example of democracy to the world, should\nbe the only civilized, if not the only state on earth, where a human\nbeing would be burned alive. My heart turned bitter within me. I could\nunderstand why Negroes are led to sympathize with even their worst\ncriminals and to protect them when possible. By all the impulses of\nnormal human nature they can and should do nothing less.\n\nWhenever I hear protests from the South that it should be left alone\nto deal with the Negro question, my thoughts go back to that scene of\nbrutality and savagery. I do not see how a people that can find in its\nconscience any excuse whatever for slowly burning to death a human\nbeing, or for tolerating such an act, can be entrusted with the\nsalvation of a race. Of course, there are in the South men of liberal\nthought who do not approve lynching, but I wonder how long they will\nendure the limits which are placed upon free speech. They still cower\nand tremble before \"Southern opinion.\" Even so late as the recent\nAtlanta riot those men who were brave enough to speak a word in behalf\nof justice and humanity felt called upon, by way of apology, to\npreface what they said with a glowing rhetorical tribute to the\nAnglo-Saxon's superiority and to refer to the \"great and impassable\ngulf\" between the races \"fixed by the Creator at the foundation of the\nworld.\" The question of the relative qualities of the two races is\nstill an open one. The reference to the \"great gulf\" loses force in\nface of the fact that there are in this country perhaps three or four\nmillion people with the blood of both races in their veins; but I fail\nto see the pertinency of either statement subsequent to the beating\nand murdering of scores of innocent people in the streets of a\ncivilized and Christian city.\n\nThe Southern whites are in many respects a great people. Looked at\nfrom a certain point of view, they are picturesque. If one will put\noneself in a romantic frame of mind, one can admire their notions\nof chivalry and bravery and justice. In this same frame of mind an\nintelligent man can go to the theatre and applaud the impossible hero,\nwho with his single sword slays everybody in the play except the\nequally impossible heroine. So can an ordinary peace-loving citizen\nsit by a comfortable fire and read with enjoyment of the bloody deeds\nof pirates and the fierce brutality of Vikings. This is the way in\nwhich we gratify the old, underlying animal instincts and passions;\nbut we should shudder with horror at the mere idea of such practices\nbeing realities in this day of enlightened and humanitarianized\nthought. The Southern whites are not yet living quite in the present\nage; many of their general ideas hark back to a former century,\nsome of them to the Dark Ages. In the light of other days they are\nsometimes magnificent. Today they are often cruel and ludicrous.\n\nHow long I sat with bitter thoughts running through my mind I do not\nknow; perhaps an hour or more. When I decided to get up and go back to\nthe house, I found that I could hardly stand on my feet. I was as weak\nas a man who had lost blood. However, I dragged myself along, with the\ncentral idea of a general plan well fixed in my mind. I did not find\nmy school teacher friend at home, so I did not see him again. I\nswallowed a few mouthfuls of food, packed my bag, and caught the\nafternoon train.\n\nWhen I reached Macon, I stopped only long enough to get the main part\nof my luggage and to buy a ticket for New York.\n\n\nAll along the journey I was occupied in debating with myself the step\nwhich I had decided to take. I argued that to forsake one's race to\nbetter one's condition was no less worthy an action than to forsake\none's country for the same purpose. I finally made up my mind that I\nwould neither disclaim the black race nor claim the white race; but\nthat I would change my name, raise a mustache, and let the world take\nme for what it would; that it was not necessary for me to go about\nwith a label of inferiority pasted across my forehead. All the while\nI understood that it was not discouragement or fear or search for a\nlarger field of action and opportunity that was driving me out of the\nNegro race. I knew that it was shame, unbearable shame. Shame at being\nidentified with a people that could with impunity be treated worse\nthan animals. For certainly the law would restrain and punish the\nmalicious burning alive of animals.\n\nSo once again I found myself gazing at the towers of New York and\nwondering what future that city held in store for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have now reached that part of my narrative where I must be brief and\ntouch only on important facts; therefore the reader must make up his\nmind to pardon skips and jumps and meager details.\n\nWhen I reached New York, I was completely lost. I could not have felt\nmore a stranger had I been suddenly dropped into Constantinople. I\nknew not where to turn or how to strike out. I was so oppressed by\na feeling of loneliness that the temptation to visit my old home in\nConnecticut was well-nigh irresistible. I reasoned, however, that\nunless I found my old music teacher, I should be, after so many\nyears of absence, as much of a stranger there as in New York; and,\nfurthermore, that in view of the step which I had decided to take,\nsuch a visit would be injudicious. I remembered, too, that I had some\nproperty there in the shape of a piano and a few books, but decided\nthat it would not be worth what it might cost me to take possession.\n\nBy reason of the fact that my living expenses in the South had been\nvery small, I still had nearly four hundred dollars of my capital\nleft. In contemplation of this, my natural and acquired Bohemian\ntastes asserted themselves, and I decided to have a couple of weeks'\ngood time before worrying seriously about the future. I went to Coney\nIsland and the other resorts, took in the pre-season shows along\nBroadway, and ate at first-class restaurants; but I shunned the old\nSixth Avenue district as though it were pest-infected. My few days of\npleasure made appalling inroads upon what cash I had, and caused me\nto see that it required a good deal of money to live in New York as I\nwished to live and that I should have to find, very soon, some more or\nless profitable employment. I was sure that unknown, without friends\nor prestige, it would be useless to try to establish myself as a\nteacher of music; so I gave that means of earning a livelihood\nscarcely any consideration. And even had I considered it possible to\nsecure pupils, as I then felt, I should have hesitated about taking up\na work in which the chances for any considerable financial success are\nnecessarily so small. I had made up my mind that since I was not going\nto be a Negro, I would avail myself of every possible opportunity to\nmake a white man's success; and that, if it can be summed up in any\none word, means \"money.\"\n\nI watched the \"want\" columns in the newspapers and answered a number\nof advertisements, but in each case found the positions were such as I\ncould not fill or did not want. I also spent several dollars for \"ads\"\nwhich brought me no replies. In this way I came to know the hopes and\ndisappointments of a large and pitiable class of humanity in this\ngreat city, the people who look for work through the newspapers.\nAfter some days of this sort of experience I concluded that the main\ndifficulty with me was that I was not prepared for what I wanted to\ndo. I then decided upon a course which, for an artist, showed an\nuncommon amount of practical sense and judgment. I made up my mind to\nenter a business college. I took a small room, ate at lunch counters,\nin order to economize, and pursued my studies with the zeal that I\nhave always been able to put into any work upon which I set my heart.\nYet, in spite of all my economy, when I had been at the school for\nseveral months, my funds gave out completely. I reached the point\nwhere I could not afford sufficient food for each day. In this plight\nI was glad to get, through one of the teachers, a job as an ordinary\nclerk in a downtown wholesale house. I did my work faithfully, and\nreceived a raise of salary before I expected it. I even managed to\nsave a little money out of my modest earnings. In fact, I began then\nto contract the money fever, which later took strong possession of me.\nI kept my eyes open, watching for a chance to better my condition. It\nfinally came in the form of a position with a house which was at the\ntime establishing a South American department. My knowledge of Spanish\nwas, of course, the principal cause of my good luck; and it did more\nfor me: it placed me where the other clerks were practically put out\nof competition with me. I was not slow in taking advantage of the\nopportunity to make myself indispensable to the firm.\n\nWhat an interesting and absorbing game is money-making! After each\ndeposit at my savings-bank I used to sit and figure out, all over\nagain, my principal and interest, and make calculations on what the\nincrease would be in such and such time. Out of this I derived a great\ndeal of pleasure. I denied myself as much as possible in order to\nswell my savings. As much as I enjoyed smoking, I limited myself to an\noccasional cigar, and that was generally of a variety which in my old\ndays at the \"Club\" was known as a \"Henry Mud.\" Drinking I cut out\naltogether, but that was no great sacrifice.\n\nThe day on which I was able to figure up a thousand dollars marked\nan epoch in my life. And this was not because I had never before had\nmoney. In my gambling days and while I was with my millionaire I\nhandled sums running high up into the hundreds; but they had come to\nme like fairy godmother's gifts, and at a time when my conception of\nmoney was that it was made only to spend. Here, on the other hand, was\na thousand dollars which I had earned by days of honest and patient\nwork, a thousand dollars which I had carefully watched grow from\nthe first dollar; and I experienced, in owning them, a pride and\nsatisfaction which to me was an entirely new sensation. As my capital\nwent over the thousand-dollar mark, I was puzzled to know what to do\nwith it, how to put it to the most advantageous use. I turned down\nfirst one scheme and then another, as though they had been devised\nfor the sole purpose of gobbling up my money. I finally listened to a\nfriend who advised me to put all I had in New York real estate; and\nunder his guidance I took equity in a piece of property on which stood\na rickety old tenement-house. I did not regret following this friend's\nadvice, for in something like six months I disposed of my equity for\nmore than double my investment. From that time on I devoted myself to\nthe study of New York real estate and watched for opportunities to\nmake similar investments. In spite of two or three speculations which\ndid not turn out well, I have been remarkably successful. Today I am\nthe owner and part-owner of several flat-houses. I have changed my\nplace of employment four times since returning to New York, and each\nchange has been a decided advancement. Concerning the position which I\nnow hold I shall say nothing except that it pays extremely well.\n\nAs my outlook on the world grew brighter, I began to mingle in the\nsocial circles of the men with whom I came in contact; and gradually,\nby a process of elimination, I reached a grade of society of no small\ndegree of culture. My appearance was always good and my ability to\nplay on the piano, especially ragtime, which was then at the height of\nits vogue, made me a welcome guest. The anomaly of my social position\noften appealed strongly to my sense of humor. I frequently smiled\ninwardly at some remark not altogether complimentary to people of\ncolor; and more than once I felt like declaiming: \"I am a colored man.\nDo I not disprove the theory that one drop of Negro blood renders a\nman unfit?\" Many a night when I returned to my room after an enjoyable\nevening, I laughed heartily over what struck me as the capital joke I\nwas playing.\n\nThen I met her, and what I had regarded as a joke was gradually\nchanged into the most serious question of my life. I first saw her\nat a musical which was given one evening at a house to which I was\nfrequently invited. I did not notice her among the other guests before\nshe came forward and sang two sad little songs. When she began, I was\nout in the hallway, where many of the men were gathered; but with the\nfirst few notes I crowded with others into the doorway to see who the\nsinger was. When I saw the girl, the surprise which I had felt at the\nfirst sound of her voice was heightened; she was almost tall and quite\nslender, with lustrous yellow hair and eyes so blue as to appear\nalmost black. She was as white as a lily, and she was dressed in\nwhite. Indeed, she seemed to me the most dazzlingly white thing I had\never seen. But it was not her delicate beauty which attracted me most;\nit was her voice, a voice which made one wonder how tones of such\npassionate color could come from so fragile a body.\n\nI determined that when the program was over, I would seek an\nintroduction to her; but at the moment, instead of being the easy\nman of the world, I became again the bashful boy of fourteen, and my\ncourage failed me. I contented myself with hovering as near her as\npoliteness would permit; near enough to hear her voice, which in\nconversation was low, yet thrilling, like the deeper middle tones of a\nflute. I watched the men gather round her talking and laughing in an\neasy manner, and wondered how it was possible for them to do it. But\ndestiny, my special destiny, was at work. I was standing near, talking\nwith affected gaiety to several young ladies, who, however, must have\nremarked my preoccupation; for my second sense of hearing was alert to\nwhat was being said by the group of which the girl in white was the\ncenter, when I heard her say: \"I think his playing of Chopin is\nexquisite.\" And one of my friends in the group replied: \"You haven't\nmet him? Allow me----\" Then turning to me, \"Old man, when you have a\nmoment I wish you to meet Miss ----.\" I don't know what she said to me\nor what I said to her. I can remember that I tried to be clever, and\nexperienced a growing conviction that I was making myself appear more\nand more idiotic. I am certain, too, that, in spite of my Italian-like\ncomplexion, I was as red as a beet.\n\nInstead of taking the car, I walked home. I needed the air and\nexercise as a sort of sedative. I am not sure whether my troubled\ncondition of mind was due to the fact that I had been struck by love\nor to the feeling that I had made a bad impression upon her.\n\nAs the weeks went by, and when I had met her several more times, I\ncame to know that I was seriously in love; and then began for me days\nof worry, for I had more than the usual doubts and fears of a young\nman in love to contend with.\n\nUp to this time I had assumed and played my role as a white man with a\ncertain degree of nonchalance, a carelessness as to the outcome, which\nmade the whole thing more amusing to me than serious; but now I ceased\nto regard \"being a white man\" as a sort of practical joke. My acting\nhad called for mere external effects. Now I began to doubt my ability\nto play the part. I watched her to see if she was scrutinizing me, to\nsee if she was looking for anything in me which made me differ\nfrom the other men she knew. In place of an old inward feeling of\nsuperiority over many of my friends I began to doubt myself. I began\neven to wonder if I really was like the men I associated with; if\nthere was not, after all, an indefinable something which marked a\ndifference.\n\nBut, in spite of my doubts and timidity, my affair progressed, and I\nfinally felt sufficiently encouraged to decide to ask her to marry\nme. Then began the hardest struggle of my life, whether to ask her to\nmarry me under false colors or to tell her the whole truth. My sense\nof what was exigent made me feel there was no necessity of saying\nanything; but my inborn sense of honor rebelled at even indirect\ndeception in this case. But however much I moralized on the question,\nI found it more and more difficult to reach the point of confession.\nThe dread that I might lose her took possession of me each time I\nsought to speak, and rendered it impossible for me to do so. That\nmoral courage requires more than physical courage is no mere poetic\nfancy. I am sure I should have found it easier to take the place of a\ngladiator, no matter how fierce the Numidian lion, than to tell that\nslender girl that I had Negro blood in my veins. The fact which I had\nat times wished to cry out, I now wished to hide forever.\n\nDuring this time we were drawn together a great deal by the mutual\nbond of music. She loved to hear me play Chopin and was herself far\nfrom being a poor performer of his compositions. I think I carried\nher every new song that was published which I thought suitable to her\nvoice, and played the accompaniment for her. Over these songs we were\nlike two innocent children with new toys. She had never been anything\nbut innocent; but my innocence was a transformation wrought by my love\nfor her, love which melted away my cynicism and whitened my sullied\nsoul and gave me back the wholesome dreams of my boyhood.\n\nMy artistic temperament also underwent an awakening. I spent many\nhours at my piano, playing over old and new composers. I also wrote\nseveral little pieces in a more or less Chopinesque style, which I\ndedicated to her. And so the weeks and months went by. Often words of\nlove trembled on my lips, but I dared not utter them, because I knew\nthey would have to be followed by other words which I had not the\ncourage to frame. There might have been some other woman in my set\nwhom I could have fallen in love with and asked to marry me without a\nword of explanation; but the more I knew this girl, the less could I\nfind it in my heart to deceive her. And yet, in spite of this specter\nthat was constantly looming up before me, I could never have believed\nthat life held such happiness as was contained in those dream days of\nlove.\n\nOne Saturday afternoon, in early June, I was coming up Fifth Avenue,\nand at the corner of Twenty-third Street I met her. She had been\nshopping. We stopped to chat for a moment, and I suggested that we\nspend half an hour at the Eden Musee. We were standing leaning on the\nrail in front of a group of figures, more interested in what we had to\nsay to each other than in the group, when my attention became fixed\nupon a man who stood at my side studying his catalogue. It took me\nonly an instant to recognize in him my old friend \"Shiny.\" My first\nimpulse was to change my position at once. As quick as a flash I\nconsidered all the risks I might run in speaking to him, and most\nespecially the delicate question of introducing him to her. I confess\nthat in my embarrassment and confusion I felt small and mean. But\nbefore I could decide what to do, he looked around at me and, after an\ninstant, quietly asked: \"Pardon me; but isn't this----?\" The nobler\npart in me responded to the sound of his voice and I took his hand in a\nhearty clasp. Whatever fears I had felt were quickly banished, for he\nseemed, at a glance, to divine my situation, and let drop no word that\nwould have aroused suspicion as to the truth. With a slight misgiving\nI presented him to her and was again relieved of fear. She received\nthe introduction in her usual gracious manner, and without the least\nhesitancy or embarrassment joined in the conversation. An amusing part\nabout the introduction was that I was upon the point of introducing\nhim as \"Shiny,\" and stammered a second or two before I could recall\nhis name. We chatted for some fifteen minutes. He was spending his\nvacation north, with the intention of doing four or six weeks' work in\none of the summer schools; he was also going to take a bride back with\nhim in the fall. He asked me about myself, but in so diplomatic a\nway that I found no difficulty in answering him. The polish of his\nlanguage and he unpedantic manner in which he revealed his culture\ngreatly impressed her; and after we had left the Musee she showed it\nby questioning me about him. I was surprised at the amount of\ninterest a refined black man could arouse. Even after changes in the\nconversation she reverted several times to the subject of \"Shiny.\"\nWhether it was more than mere curiosity I could not tell, but I was\nconvinced that she herself knew very little about prejudice.\n\nJust why it should have done so I do not know, but somehow the \"Shiny\"\nincident gave me encouragement and confidence to cast the die of my\nfate. I reasoned, however, that since I wanted to marry her only, and\nsince it concerned her alone, I would divulge my secret to no one\nelse, not even her parents.\n\nOne evening, a few days afterwards, at her home we were going over\nsome new songs and compositions when she asked me, as she often did,\nto play the Thirteenth Nocturne. When I began, she drew a chair near\nto my right and sat leaning with her elbow on the end of the piano,\nher chin resting on her hand, and her eyes reflecting the emotions\nwhich the music awoke in her. An impulse which I could not control\nrushed over me, a wave of exultation, the music under my fingers\nsank almost to a whisper, and calling her for the first time by her\nChristian name, but without daring to look at her, I said: \"I love\nyou, I love you, I love you.\" My fingers were trembling so that I\nceased playing. I felt her hand creep to mine, and when I looked at\nher, her eyes were glistening with tears. I understood, and could\nscarcely resist the longing to take her in my arms; but I remembered,\nremembered that which has been the sacrificial altar of so much\nhappiness--Duty; and bending over her hand in mine, I said: \"Yes, I\nlove you; but there is something more, too, that I must tell you.\"\nThen I told her, in what words I do not know, the truth. I felt her\nhand grow cold, and when I looked up, she was gazing at me with a\nwild, fixed stare as though I was some object she had never seen.\nUnder the strange light in her eyes I felt that I was growing black\nand thick-featured and crimp-haired. She appeared not to have\ncomprehended what I had said. Her lips trembled and she attempted to\nsay something to me, but the words stuck in her throat. Then, dropping\nher head on the piano, she began to weep with great sobs that shook\nher frail body. I tried to console her, and blurted out incoherent\nwords of love, but this seemed only to increase her distress, and when\nI left her, she was still weeping.\n\nWhen I got into the street, I felt very much as I did the night after\nmeeting my father and sister at the opera in Paris, even a similar\ndesperate inclination to get drunk; but my self-control was stronger.\nThis was the only time in my life that I ever felt absolute regret at\nbeing colored, that I cursed the drops of African blood in my veins\nand wished that I were really white. When I reached my rooms, I sat\nand smoked several cigars while I tried to think out the significance\nof what had occurred. I reviewed the whole history of our\nacquaintance, recalled each smile she had given me, each word she had\nsaid to me that nourished my hope. I went over the scene we had just\ngone through, trying to draw from it what was in my favor and what was\nagainst me. I was rewarded by feeling confident that she loved me, but\nI could not estimate what was the effect upon her of my confession. At\nlast, nervous and unhappy, I wrote her a letter, which I dropped into\nthe mail-box before going to bed, in which I said:\n\n  I understand, understand even better than you, and so\n  I suffer even more than you. But why should either of us\n  suffer for what neither of us is to blame for? If there is\n  any blame, it belongs to me and I can only make the old,\n  yet strongest plea that can be offered, I love you; and I\n  know that my love, my great love, infinitely overbalances\n  that blame and blots it out. What is it that stands in the\n  way of our happiness? It is not what you feel or what I\n  feel; it is not what you are or what I am. It is what others\n  feel and are. But, oh! is that a fair price? In all the\n  endeavors and struggles of life, in all our strivings and\n  longings, there is only one thing worth seeking, only one\n  thing worth winning, and that is love. It is not always\n  found; but when it is, there is nothing in all the world for\n  which it can be profitably exchanged.\n\nThe second morning after, I received a note from her which stated\nbriefly that she was going up into New Hampshire to spend the summer\nwith relatives there. She made no reference to what had passed between\nus; nor did she say exactly when she would leave the city. The note\ncontained no single word that gave me any clue to her feelings. I\ncould gather hope only from the fact that she had written at all.\nOn the same evening, with a degree of trepidation which rendered me\nalmost frightened, I went to her house.\n\nI met her mother, who told me that she had left for the country that\nvery afternoon. Her mother treated me in her usual pleasant manner,\nwhich fact greatly reassured me; and I left the house with a vague\nsense of hope stirring in my breast, which sprang from the conviction\nthat she had not yet divulged my secret. But that hope did not remain\nwith me long. I waited one, two, three weeks, nervously examining my\nmail every day, looking for some word from her. All of the letters\nreceived by me seemed so insignificant, so worthless, because there\nwas none from her. The slight buoyancy of spirit which I had felt\ngradually dissolved into gloomy heart-sickness. I became preoccupied;\nI lost appetite, lost sleep, and lost ambition. Several of my friends\nintimated to me that perhaps I was working too hard.\n\nShe stayed away the whole summer. I did not go to the house, but saw\nher father at various times, and he was as friendly as ever. Even\nafter I knew that she was back in town, I did not go to see her. I\ndetermined to wait for some word or sign. I had finally taken refuge\nand comfort in my pride, pride which, I suppose, I came by naturally\nenough.\n\nThe first time I saw her after her return was one night at the\ntheatre. She and her mother sat in company with a young man whom I\nknew slightly, not many seats away from me. Never did she appear more\nbeautiful; and yet, it may have been my fancy, she seemed a trifle\npaler, and there was a suggestion of haggardness in her countenance.\nBut that only heightened her beauty; the very delicacy of her charm\nmelted down the strength of my pride. My situation made me feel weak\nand powerless, like a man trying with his bare hands to break the iron\nbars of his prison cell. When the performance was over, I hurried out\nand placed myself where, unobserved, I could see her as she passed\nout. The haughtiness of spirit in which I had sought relief was all\ngone, and I was willing and ready to undergo any humiliation.\n\nShortly afterward we met at a progressive card party, and during the\nevening we were thrown together at one of the tables as partners. This\nwas really our first meeting since the eventful night at her house.\nStrangely enough, in spite of our mutual nervousness, we won every\ntrick of the game, and one of our opponents jokingly quoted the old\nsaw: \"Lucky at cards, unlucky in love.\" Our eyes met and I am sure\nthat in the momentary glance my whole soul went out to her in one\ngreat plea. She lowered her eyes and uttered a nervous little laugh.\nDuring the rest of the game I fully merited the unexpressed and\nexpressed abuse of my various partners; for my eyes followed her\nwherever she was and I played whatever card my fingers happened to\ntouch.\n\nLater in the evening she went to the piano and began to play very\nsoftly, as to herself, the opening bars of the Thirteenth Nocturne. I\nfelt that the psychic moment of my life had come, a moment which, if\nlost, could never be called back; and, in as careless a manner as I\ncould assume, I sauntered over to the piano and stood almost bending\nover her. She continued playing, but, in a voice that was almost a\nwhisper, she called me by my Christian name and said: \"I love you, I\nlove you, I love you.\" I took her place at the piano and played the\nNocturne in a manner that silenced the chatter of the company both in\nand out of the room, involuntarily closing it with the major triad.\n\nWe were married the following spring, and went to Europe for several\nmonths. It was a double joy for me to be in France again under such\nconditions.\n\nFirst there came to us a little girl, with hair and eyes dark like\nmine, but who is growing to have ways like her mother. Two years later\nthere came a boy, who has my temperament, but is fair like his mother,\na little golden-headed god, with a face and head that would have\ndelighted the heart of an old Italian master. And this boy, with his\nmother's eyes and features, occupies an inner sanctuary of my heart;\nfor it was for him that she gave all; and that is the second sacred\nsorrow of my life.\n\nThe few years of our married life were supremely happy, and perhaps\nshe was even happier than I; for after our marriage, in spite of all\nthe wealth of her love which she lavished upon me, there came a new\ndread to haunt me, a dread which I cannot explain and which was\nunfounded, but one that never left me. I was in constant fear that she\nwould discover in me some shortcoming which she would unconsciously\nattribute to my blood rather than to a failing of human nature. But\nno cloud ever came to mar our life together; her loss to me is\nirreparable. My children need a mother's care, but I shall never marry\nagain. It is to my children that I have devoted my life. I no longer\nhave the same fear for myself of my secret's being found out, for\nsince my wife's death I have gradually dropped out of social life;\nbut there is nothing I would not suffer to keep the brand from being\nplaced upon them.\n\nIt is difficult for me to analyze my feelings concerning my present\nposition in the world. Sometimes it seems to me that I have never\nreally been a Negro, that I have been only a privileged spectator of\ntheir inner life; at other times I feel that I have been a coward,\na deserter, and I am possessed by a strange longing for my mother's\npeople.\n\nSeveral years ago I attended a great meeting in the interest of\nHampton Institute at Carnegie Hall. The Hampton students sang the old\nsongs and awoke memories that left me sad. Among the speakers were\nR.C. Ogden, ex-Ambassador Choate, and Mark Twain; but the greatest\ninterest of the audience was centered in Booker T. Washington, and not\nbecause he so much surpassed the others in eloquence, but because of\nwhat he represented with so much earnestness and faith. And it is\nthis that all of that small but gallant band of colored men who are\npublicly fighting the cause of their race have behind them. Even those\nwho oppose them know that these men have the eternal principles of\nright on their side, and they will be victors even though they should\ngo down in defeat. Beside them I feel small and selfish. I am an\nordinarily successful white man who has made a little money. They are\nmen who are making history and a race. I, too, might have taken part\nin a work so glorious.\n\nMy love for my children makes me glad that I am what I am and keeps me\nfrom desiring to be otherwise; and yet, when I sometimes open a little\nbox in which I still keep my fast yellowing manuscripts, the only\ntangible remnants of a vanished dream, a dead ambition, a sacrificed\ntalent, I cannot repress the thought that, after all, I have chosen\nthe lesser part, that I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage.\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":14251.0,"summary_name":"Chapters X-XI","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180424054150\/http:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/the-autobiography-of-an-excolored-man\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-x-xi","summary_text":"On the boat back to America, the narrator meets a large, dignified African American man, , a graduate of Howard University. They strike up a friendship and discuss the race question. The doctor is \"broad-minded\" and believes that \"Negroes\" are progressing, although he sympathizes with certain aspects of the white, Southern perspective. The narrator stays with his new friend in Boston for a few days and then accompanies him to Washington D.C., where the doctor lives. The narrator becomes quickly acquainted with the doctor's friends, all educated African Americans, who earn \"good salaries and a reasonable amount of leisure time to draw from\" . The doctor, meanwhile, is very critical of who he deems \"the worst\" of the race. The narrator reflects positively on his time in Washington but then moves on to Macon, Georgia. On the way, he ends up in the smoking car of the train. The men gathered there are cordial and convivial; they include a Jewish cigar maker, a white professor, an ex-Union soldier, and a boisterous Texan planter. The race question comes up. The Jewish man takes neither side but listens and comments politely. The professor is flustered and does not participate. The argument is mostly between the old soldier and the Texan. The Texan does not believe in racial equality at all while the Union soldier argues for it. The Texan tries to claim the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race, but the soldier ably and eloquently explains that all of the accomplishments of the Anglo-Saxons are built on discoveries made by other races. The Texan is impressed, but jovially says his mind will never be changed. The narrator cannot help but admire his steadfastness, but also hopes that the mental attitudes of Southerners can be changed one day. In Macon, the narrator decides to leave his things behind and travel through the country. He sees rural African Americans for the first time and is not impressed. He is also annoyed with the poor cooking and accommodations of the South, wondering if his millionaire friend was right. He discourses for some time on the differences between the North and the South in their feelings on \"the colored man\". While he is in the South, the narrator also attends a \"big meeting\", which is a large religious gathering. It is a boisterous and exciting atmosphere. The narrator observes one impressive preacher, John Brown, and a music leader, Singing Johnson. Brown demonstrates \"all the arts and tricks of oratory\" and holds his listeners spellbound with his sermons about heaven and hell. Meanwhile, Johnson knows all of the spiritual songs and is a master at leading the congregation. The narrator marvels at the wonder of his songs' production. He feels inspired by this meeting. The narrator decides to stay with a young African American schoolteacher for a few days. This man strikes the narrator as being too earnest about the race question, but intelligent and ambitious nonetheless. They retire to a boarding house but the narrator is stirred awake by a frantic sounds outside. He hears a rumor from the people flowing past the house that a crime has been committed. Defying the schoolteacher's warnings, the narrator leaves the house and joins a crowd at the station. It is mostly white people with some black people at the fringes. A \"poor wretch\", a black man, is dragged into the circle. The white people throw up a fiendish \"rebel yell\", resembling \"savage beasts\". They tie the man to a stake and burn him alive. The narrator is horrified and dazed, but he is also humiliated that he is part of a race that can be victim to such horrible crimes. He is also in disbelief at how \"a people that can find in its conscience any excuse whatever for slowly burning to death a human being, or for tolerating such an act, can be entrusted with the salvation of a race\". He ultimately decides that he will not claim or declaim his blackness and will simply pass for whatever people assume his race to be. He departs for New York. Back in New York, the narrator feels lost but decides to amuse himself for a few days before looking for a job. This endeavor is depressing and he decides to enroll in business school. It is not long before he becomes a clerk in a wholesale house. He lives frugally and then begins investing in real estate, at which he is extremely successful. He passes for white and is content with this until the day he falls in love with a woman. She is a singer and the narrator describes her as \"the most dazzlingly white thing I have ever seen\". They begin courting and he decides he wants to marry her; this makes him wonder if he should tell her the truth about his face. He agonizes over this decision for some time. One Sunday afternoon the narrator and the girl run into Shiny on the street. Now a professor, Shiny is in town to work in a summer school before getting married. The girl is very kind to Shiny and interested in him after he leaves, and the narrator therefore feels comfortable that she will accept his secret. He tells her and she is shocked into silence until she begins weeping. This, the narrator says, is the only moment he ever feels \"absolute regret at being colored\". The girl goes away for the summer and they do not have any communication. The narrator is heart-sick. A few months later, he learns she is back in town and they run into each other at the theater. They meet again at another party and there she confesses that she loves him too. The two are married and have two children; unfortunately, the girl dies in the second childbirth. The narrator claims he will never marry again and devotes his life to his children. He expresses ambivalence about his \"present position in the world\". On the one hand, he is glad he passes as white for his children's sake. On the other hand, he sees prominent African Americans like Booker T. Washington and feels like an insignificant white man who has managed to make some money, a choice which deprived him of standing up for his race. He ends the novel by wondering if \"I have chosen the lesser part...I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage\". In this section, the narrator travels to Europe and falls in love with Paris. However, he realizes that he needs to get back to his musical career and become a composer. He decides that the best place to do this is in the South, where he can be inspired by the African American music scene. The narrator's confusion and vacillation between being black or white permeates all of his decisions; his ambivalence suggests that he will not ever achieve a hegemonic racial identity. In these last two chapters of the novel, there are multiple depictions of African Americans. The narrator meets the doctor, who the narrator believes represents the best of the race, but back in the South, he is embarrassed by the downtrodden African Americans who populate the streets. He is inspired by the magnetic, impassioned, and authentic personages of Singing Johnson and John Brown, but is disgusted by the absolute debasement of a poor black man who is lynched by a white crowd. In this climactic moment, the anguished narrator comes to the conclusion that he can no longer live openly as a biracial man and that he will be content to pass for white. He decidedly rejects his heritage and embraces a life based on earning money and avoiding the difficulties and indignities that arise from being biracial. It is a willful self-denial seems to haunt him by the end of his story. By the end of the novel, the narrator's goals of making music that represents the traditions of his people and embracing his dual heritage are a distant memory. He is heavy with isolation and remorse. Because the narrator is biracial, he is able to critique both races according to Du Bois's theory of double consciousness. However, he rejects that potential source of power. He is ashamed of his blackness and wants to hide it. The critic Donald Goellnicht writes, \"so complete is the obliteration of an African heritage, so complete is the cultural assimilation to Euro-American values, that psychical bondage is obviated; the compliant subject policies himself.\" The narrative is destabilized by the inversion of what the reader assumes will occur -the narrator's becoming a \"race man\", a man like the doctor on the ship. His ultimate choice to pass as white is unpredictable and disappointing to many readers. On the other hand, it is possible to view the narrator's choice to pass as a veritable slap in the face to fixed notions of the racial divide. The narrator has an African American parent but is able to live and make money in a society dominated by white people without their even knowing it. This begs the question - does it even matter that the narrator is half-black? The marriage between the narrator and his wife would have fallen under the category of miscegenation if he revealed his racial background. The mere fact that the narrator chooses to pass as white may be viewed as a profound example of power and autonomy. He is an individual who chooses the path that he believes is right for himself and, later, for his family. Many critics have claimed that the novel is \"ironic\", but if it is, it is better viewed as a postmodern form of irony that does not rely on a stable referent. The act of \"passing\" can be held up to this standard as well. Passing implies that a person must be racially homogenous, but most cases do not fall neatly on one side of the racial divide. Passing could be intentional or unintentional; it was not just an imposter trying to cross the color line. As critic Neil Brooks explains, \"the physical manifestation of a psychological quest to understand oneself in a society where to be black was often not to have one consistent self, but to have a double self.\" The narrator's multiple identities and contradictions end up becoming his identity. He chooses the easier path but as a result, he cannot achieve any closure. This closure is a trope of the modernist reading of literature, but here is precisely why a postmodernist reading is more appropriate: \"the narrator has created a world where all is organized around himself, but it can never truly be organized because the self he has placed at the center is as unstable as the external world he seeks to control.\" The narrator's lack of a name also underscores his lack of a stable identity. This may indicate that he does not want to be labeled and participate in social classifications. Having always touted himself as the best at whatever he does, his namelessness is one further way for the narrator to overcome society's barriers and achieve material success. The tragedy of his choice is that he can be neither black nor white, and society still propagates arbitrary categorizations that, Brooks writes, \"cannot be applied adequately to the personal narratives of its individual members.\" Since the narrator never embraces a stable identity, the act of passing becomes that identity. His \"freedom from the societal meta-narratives of race\" brings with it \"the chaos of a disordered universe, which is also central to postmodern theory.\" Try as he might, the narrator can never bring closure to his own story. Overall, the novel proffers the idea that ambiguity about race is certainly part of a larger conversation, but that it is ultimately irresolvable.","summary_analysis":null,"summary_length":1963.0,"analysis_length":1.0,"chap_int":11,"previous summary id":[],"previous chapter":[],"next summary id":"chapters 10-11","next chapter":"On the boat back to America, the narrator meets a large, dignified African American man, , a graduate of Howard University.

Three days after Julien's death, Madame de Renal drops dead for unknown reasons. She's hugging her children at the time. Yeah, pretty grim ending for sure.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"CHAPTER LXXV\n\n\n\"I cannot play such a trick on that poor abbe Chas-Bernard, as to\nsummon him,\" he said to Fouque: \"it would prevent him from dining for\nthree whole days.--But try and find some Jansenist who is a friend of\nM. Pirard.\"\n\nFouque was impatiently waiting for this suggestion. Julien acquitted\nhimself becomingly of all the duty a man owes to provincial opinion.\nThanks to M. the abbe de Frilair, and in spite of his bad choice of a\nconfessor, Julien enjoyed in his cell the protection of the priestly\ncongregation; with a little more diplomacy he might have managed to\nescape. But the bad air of the cell produced its effect, and his\nstrength of mind diminished. But this only intensified his happiness at\nmadame de Renal's return.\n\n\"My first duty is towards you, my dear,\" she said as she embraced him;\n\"I have run away from Verrieres.\"\n\nJulien felt no petty vanity in his relations with her, and told her all\nhis weaknesses. She was good and charming to him.\n\nIn the evening she had scarcely left the prison before she made the\npriest, who had clung on to Julien like a veritable prey, go to her\naunt's: as his only object was to win prestige among the young women\nwho belonged to good Besancon society, madame de Renal easily prevailed\nupon him to go and perform a novena at the abbey of Bray-le-Haut.\n\nNo words can do justice to the madness and extravagance of Julien's\nlove.\n\nBy means of gold, and by using and abusing the influence of her aunt,\nwho was devout, rich and well-known, madame de Renal managed to see him\ntwice a day.\n\nAt this news, Mathilde's jealousy reached a pitch of positive madness.\nM. de Frilair had confessed to her that all his influence did not go\nso far as to admit of flouting the conventions by allowing her to\nsee her sweetheart more than once every day. Mathilde had madame de\nRenal followed so as to know the smallest thing she did. M. de Frilair\nexhausted all the resources of an extremely clever intellect in order\nto prove to her that Julien was unworthy of her.\n\nPlunged though she was in all these torments, she only loved him the\nmore, and made a horrible scene nearly every day.\n\nJulien wished, with all his might, to behave to the very end like an\nhonourable man towards this poor young girl whom he had so strangely\ncompromised, but the reckless love which he felt for madame de Renal\nswept him away at every single minute. When he could not manage to\npersuade Mathilde of the innocence of her rival's visits by all his\nthin excuses, he would say to himself: \"at any rate the end of the\ndrama ought to be quite near. The very fact of not being able to lie\nbetter will be an excuse for me.\"\n\nMademoiselle de La Mole learnt of the death of the marquis de\nCroisenois. The rich M. de Thaler had indulged in some unpleasant\nremarks concerning Mathilde's disappearance: M. de Croisenois went\nand asked him to recant them: M. de Thaler showed him some anonymous\nletters which had been sent to him, and which were full of details so\nartfully put together that the poor marquis could not help catching a\nglimpse of the truth.\n\nM. de Thaler indulged in some jests which were devoid of all taste.\nMaddened by anger and unhappiness, M. de Croisenois demanded such\nunqualified satisfaction, that the millionaire preferred to fight a\nduel. Stupidity triumphed, and one of the most lovable of men met with\nhis death before he was twenty-four.\n\nThis death produced a strange and morbid impression on Julien's\ndemoralised soul.\n\n\"Poor Croisenois,\" he said to Mathilde, \"really behaved very reasonably\nand very honourably towards us; he had ample ground for hating me and\npicking a quarrel with me, by reason of your indiscretion in your\nmother's salon; for the hatred which follows on contempt is usually\nfrenzied.\"\n\nM. de Croisenois' death changed all Julien's ideas concerning\nMathilde's future. He spent several days in proving to her that she\nought to accept the hand of M. de Luz. \"He is a nervous man, not too\nmuch of a Jesuit, and will doubtless be a candidate,\" he said to her.\n\"He has a more sinister and persevering ambition than poor Croisenois,\nand as there has never been a dukedom in his family, he will be only\ntoo glad to marry Julien Sorel's widow.\"\n\n\"A widow, though, who scorns the grand passions,\" answered Mathilde\ncoldly, \"for she has lived long enough to see her lover prefer to\nher after six months another woman who was the origin of all their\nunhappiness.\"\n\n\"You are unjust! Madame de Renal's visits will furnish my advocate\nat Paris, who is endeavouring to procure my pardon, with the subject\nmatter for some sensational phrases; he will depict the murderer\nhonoured by the attention of his victim. That may produce an\nimpression, and perhaps some day or other, you will see me provide the\nplot of some melodrama or other, etc., etc.\"\n\nA furious and impotent jealousy, a prolonged and hopeless unhappiness\n(for even supposing Julien was saved, how was she to win back his\nheart?), coupled with her shame and anguish at loving this unfaithful\nlover more than ever had plunged mademoiselle de la Mole into a gloomy\nsilence, from which all the careful assiduity of M. de Frilair was as\nlittle able to draw her as the rugged frankness of Fouque.\n\nAs for Julien, except in those moments which were taken up by\nMathilde's presence, he lived on love with scarcely a thought for the\nfuture.\n\n\"In former days,\" Julien said to her, \"when I might have been so happy,\nduring our walks in the wood of Vergy, a frenzied ambition swept my\nsoul into the realms of imagination. Instead of pressing to my heart\nthat charming arm which is so near my lips, the thoughts of my future\ntook me away from you; I was engaged in countless combats which I\nshould have to sustain in order to lay the foundations of a colossal\nfortune. No, I should have died without knowing what happiness was if\nyou had not come to see me in this prison.\"\n\nTwo episodes ruffled this tranquil life. Julien's confessor, Jansenist\nthough he was, was not proof against an intrigue of the Jesuits, and\nbecame their tool without knowing it.\n\nHe came to tell him one day that unless he meant to fall into the awful\nsin of suicide, he ought to take every possible step to procure his\npardon. Consequently, as the clergy have a great deal of influence with\nthe minister of Justice at Paris, an easy means presented itself; he\nought to become converted with all publicity.\n\n\"With publicity,\" repeated Julien. \"Ha, Ha! I have caught you at it--I\nhave caught you as well, my father, playing a part like any missionary.\"\n\n\"Your youth,\" replied the Jansenist gravely, \"the interesting\nappearance which Providence has given you, the still unsolved mystery\nof the motive for your crime, the heroic steps which mademoiselle de\nla Mole has so freely taken on your behalf, everything, up to the\nsurprising affection which your victim manifests towards you, has\ncontributed to make you the hero of the young women of Besancon.\nThey have forgotten everything, even politics, on your account. Your\nconversion will reverberate in their hearts and will leave behind it a\ndeep impression. You can be of considerable use to religion, and I was\nabout to hesitate for the trivial reason that in a similar circumstance\nthe Jesuits would follow a similar course. But if I did, even in the\none case which has escaped their greedy clutches they would still be\nexercising their mischief. The tears which your conversation will\ncause to be shed will annul the poisonous effect of ten editions of\nVoltaire's works.\"\n\n\"And what will be left for me,\" answered Julien, coldly, \"if I despise\nmyself? I have been ambitious; I do not mean to blame myself in any\nway. Further, I have acted in accordance with the code of the age. Now\nI am living from day to day. But I should make myself very unhappy\nif I were to yield to what the locality would regard as a piece of\ncowardice....\"\n\nMadame de Renal was responsible for the other episode which affected\nJulien in quite another way. Some intriguing woman friend or other had\nmanaged to persuade this naive and timid soul that it was her duty\nto leave for St. Cloud, and go and throw herself at the feet of King\nCharles X.\n\nShe had made the sacrifice of separating from Julien, and after\na strain as great as that, she no longer thought anything of the\nunpleasantness of making an exhibition of herself, though in former\ntimes she would have thought that worse than death.\n\n\"I will go to the king. I will confess freely that you are my lover.\nThe life of a man, and of a man like Julien, too, ought to prevail over\nevery consideration. I will tell him that it was because of jealousy\nthat you made an attempt upon my life. There are numerous instances of\npoor young people who have been saved in such a case by the clemency of\nthe jury or of the king.\"\n\n\"I will leave off seeing you; I will shut myself up in my prison,\"\nexclaimed Julien, \"and you can be quite certain that if you do not\npromise me to take no step which will make a public exhibition of us\nboth, I will kill myself in despair the day afterwards. This idea of\ngoing to Paris is not your own. Tell me the name of the intriguing\nwoman who suggested it to you.\n\n\"Let us be happy during the small number of days of this short life.\nLet us hide our existence; my crime was only too self-evident.\nMademoiselle de la Mole enjoys all possible influence at Paris. Take\nit from me that she has done all that is humanly possible. Here in\nthe provinces I have all the men of wealth and prestige against me.\nYour conduct will still further aggravate those rich and essentially\nmoderate people to whom life comes so easy.... Let us not give the\nMaslons, the Valenods, and the thousand other people who are worth more\nthan they, anything to laugh about.\"\n\nJulien came to find the bad air of the cell unbearable. Fortunately,\nnature was rejoicing in a fine sunshine on the day when they announced\nto him that he would have to die, and he was in a courageous vein.\nHe found walking in the open air as delicious a sensation as the\nnavigator, who has been at sea for a long time, finds walking on the\nground. \"Come on, everything is going all right,\" he said to himself.\n\"I am not lacking in courage.\"\n\nHis head had never looked so poetical as at that moment when it was on\nthe point of falling. The sweet minutes which he had formerly spent in\nthe woods of Vergy crowded back upon his mind with extreme force.\n\nEverything went off simply, decorously, and without any affectation on\nhis part.\n\nTwo days before he had said to Fouque: \"I cannot guarantee not to\nshow some emotion. This dense, squalid cell gives me fits of fever in\nwhich I do not recognise myself, but fear?--no! I shall not be seen to\nflinch.\"\n\nHe had made his arrangements in advance for Fouque to take Mathilde and\nmadame de Renal away on the morning of his last day.\n\n\"Drive them away in the same carriage,\" he had said. \"Do you see that\nthe post-horses do not leave off galloping. They will either fall into\neach other's arms, or manifest towards each other a mortal hatred.\nIn either case the poor women will have something to distract them a\nlittle from their awful grief.\"\n\nJulien had made madame de Renal swear that she would live to look after\nMathilde's son.\n\n\"Who knows? Perhaps we have still some sensations after our death,\" he\nhad said one day to Fouque. \"I should like to rest, for rest is the\nright word, in that little grotto in the great mountain which dominates\nVerrieres. Many a time, as I have told you, I have spent the night\nalone in that grotto, and as my gaze would plunge far and wide over the\nrichest provinces of France, ambition would inflame my heart. In those\ndays it was my passion.... Anyway, I hold that grotto dear, and one\ncannot dispute that its situation might well arouse the desires of the\nphilosopher's soul.... Well, you know! those good priests of Besancon\nwill make money out of everything. If you know how to manage it, they\nwill sell you my mortal remains.\"\n\nFouque succeeded in this melancholy business. He was passing the night\nalone in his room by his friend's body when, to his great surprise, he\nsaw Mathilde come in. A few hours before he had left her ten leagues\nfrom Besancon. Her face and eyes looked distraught.\n\n\"I want to see him,\" she said.\n\nFouque had not the courage either to speak or get up. He pointed with\nhis finger to a big blue cloak on the floor; there was wrapped in it\nall that remained of Julien.\n\nShe threw herself on her knees. The memory of Boniface de la Mole, and\nof Marguerite of Navarre gave her, no doubt, a superhuman courage. Her\ntrembling hands undid the cloak. Fouque turned away his eyes.\n\nHe heard Mathilde walking feverishly about the room. She lit several\ncandles. When Fouque could bring himself to look at her, she had placed\nJulien's head on a little marble table in front of her, and was kissing\nit on the forehead.\n\nMathilde followed her lover to the tomb which he had chosen. A great\nnumber of priests convoyed the bier, and, alone in her draped carriage,\nwithout anyone knowing it, she carried on her knees the head of the man\nwhom she had loved so much.\n\nWhen they arrived in this way at the most elevated peak of the high\nmountains of the Jura, twenty priests celebrated the service of the\ndead in the middle of the night in this little grotto, which was\nmagnificently illuminated by a countless number of wax candles.\nAttracted by this strange and singular ceremony, all the inhabitants\nof the little mountain villages which the funeral had passed through,\nfollowed it.\n\nMathilde appeared in their midst in long mourning garments, and had\nseveral thousands of five-franc pieces thrown to them at the end of the\nservice.\n\nWhen she was left alone with Fouque, she insisted on burying her\nlover's head with her own hands. Fouque nearly went mad with grief.\n\nMathilde took care that this wild grotto should be decorated with\nmarble monuments that had been sculpted in Italy at great expense.\n\nMadame de Renal kept her promise. She did not try to make any attempt\nupon her life; but she died embracing her children, three days after\nJulien.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n","chapter_length":2307.0,"summary_name":"Part 2, Chapter 45","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200920104425\/https:\/\/www.shmoop.com\/study-guides\/literature\/red-and-the-black\/summary\/part-2-chapter-45","summary_text":"Julien mentions to his buddy Fouqe that he's willing to consider a last second escape from prison.

He agrees to appeal if she will visit him every day in his cell. They know complete happiness. After three days, M. de Renal has ordered that his wife return to Verrieres. An ambitious priest has undertaken the conversion of Julien and has posted himself in all weather outside the prison, where much to Julien's annoyance, he attracts a great crowd. In desperation, Julien admits him, then rids himself of the troublesome priest by sending him to say masses for the poor. Mathilde arrives on the heels of the departing priest to relate the treachery of Valenod and to try to convince Julien of the necessity of requesting a reprieve. Julien finally sends her away, requesting that she listen to a mass for him. The much dreaded visit of his father occurs. Sorel ceases his reproaches when Julien suggests that he will bequeath his money to his father and brothers. Julien then shares a bottle of champagne with two other prisoners and listens to the life story of one. Finally, Julien is left to his gloomy meditations. Julien submits to confession, and provincial public opinion is thereby satisfied. Mme. de Renal has left Verrieres and, living with her aunt in Besancon, visits Julien twice a day. This bliss is interrupted by the daily visits of Mathilde. M. de Croisenois has been killed in a duel defending the honor of Mathilde. Julien angrily rejects a Jansenist's entreaties that he make a spectacular conversion, which, according to the priest, would encourage many lost souls to return to the Church. Julien must dissuade Mme. de Renal from begging a reprieve from the king at Saint-Cloud. After the execution, Mathilde visits the cell and carries off Julien's head. Fouque, carrying out Julien's last wishes, negotiates his burial on a high hill overlooking Verrieres. Mathilde accompanies the procession and with her own hands buries Julien's head. Mme. de Renal dies three days after the death of Julien.\", \"analysis\": \"In the time of the novel, the action of Chapter 43 occurs only one hour after Mathilde had left Julien's cell in the preceding chapter. In Chapter 43, the incident of greatest importance is, of course, Mme. de Renal's visit with Julien. Then in almost a sentence, Stendhal indicates that \\\"three days after these visits had been taking place,\\\" M. de Renal recalls her home. The end of the chapter elaborates another short incident, the interview of the priest, and Chapter 44 opens with the immediate reaction of Julien after the priest has left. This is typical of Stendhal's treatment of time and events. A single chapter develops one incident , culminates it , and introduces a second . The long-awaited event is the reunion of Mme. de Renal with Julien. Stendhal tells us that Julien has never known such happiness, although the author's \\\"pudeur\\\" prevents him, as usual, from elaborating the ecstatic happiness that both enjoy during this supreme moment. He passes over it with: \\\"much later, when they were able to speak.\\\" Mme. de Renal loves Julien as a human should love only God. This is no doubt the love that Stendhal would have wanted to receive. Mme. de Renal's sadness and admission of her disgrace prompt a \\\"new happiness\\\" in Julien. In Stendhal's conception of love, one constantly makes new discoveries in the object, which increases one's love for her. We are now aware of the extent of Julien's love for Mme. de Renal and of how instrumental it has been in his calm acceptance of the death penalty up to this point. Imagining himself bereft of her love, Julien was prepared for death. Now, a new possibility of happiness opens up before him, and he will really know the terror of the condemned man. The priest's visit serves to materialize Julien's despair, and thereafter, he sees death as horrible. It was no doubt Stendhal's \\\"pudeur\\\" that prevented him from giving titles to the last four chapters in the original version of the novel. It is as if the suggestion of privacy were thus made after Julien has been condemned to death. Within one short chapter, Julien moves from the heights of bliss to the depths of despair. Weeping about his own death, Julien will be visited, in Chapter 44, by three more \\\"misfortunes\\\": the visits of Mathilde and of his father, and exposure to the criminals with whom he shares a bottle of champagne. From these he will draw food for meditation. During these meditations, the reader will witness, for the last time, Julien's solitude. There exists in this chapter the same movement as in the preceding one, but in reverse: From the depths of despair, Julien will emerge \\\"strong and resolute, as a man who sees clearly into his own heart.\\\" Julien finally learns about the machinations of Mathilde and Frilair. The latter, no doubt in an effort to mitigate the betrayal he has suffered personally from Valenod, has tried to shift the blame for Julien's conviction to Julien himself. Frilair sees the courtroom oration as an invitation for condemnation to death. Julien has great difficulty in concealing his despair from Mathilde. His remark concerning the prisoner's public situation vis-a-vis the world sets the tone for the chapter. Just as in life outside, Julien is forced to adopt a hypocritical air in dealing with his visitors to protect what remains of his courage. The interlude of the prisoners is at once a moment of respite, of relief -- an escape from the horror of the present moment -- thereby permitting Julien to transform his self-reproach and grief into a more objective melancholy, and a pendant to the visit by his father. Both incidents are inspirational to his musings in the latter part of the chapter. The prisoner episode is reminiscent of the appearance of Geronomo at the Renal home in Part I, which constituted a sort of poetic escape from the misfortunes of the family. Here, there is a more macabre note. Greed for money has motivated the life of this criminal, otherwise endowed with a brave heart. Thus taken out of himself, Julien is able to recapture the necessary detachment to arrive at the re-creation of the required attitude before death. From Julien's meditations result some of the very important ingredients of beylism: the need to see man for what he is, not to be taken in, not to betray one's real nature; the danger of trading the present moment of happiness, so hard to come by, for sterile meditations about the unfathomable; in the absence of any ethical basis of society, the necessity of the creation of and adherence to a private code of morality based upon duty toward oneself. Five days elapsed during Chapter 44. Stendhal terminates his novel with rapidity. One would be hard put to say over what extent of time the action takes place in the final chapter. It opens as a continuation of the final scene of the preceding chapter: Fouque awakens Julien, the latter having regained his composure and resolution. Stendhal is winding up, moving from Julien's relationship to Mme. de Renal, to Mathilde, almost without transition. Julien admits to Mme. de Renal that he mistook, at the time, the real happiness he had known with her in Vergy. Mathilde is insanely jealous of Mme. de Renal's visits, and Julien's own role toward Mathilde has now become almost paternal, just as Mme. de Renal's love for him still has a maternal character. Stendhal's refusal to indulge in hyperbolic description and pathos is evidenced by his very sparse treatment of the execution of Julien, which has been termed literary euthanasia. We are told that the weather was beautiful and that Julien was poetic, courageous, observant of decorum. Stendhal even makes Julien \\\"speak\\\" after the narration of his death, as instructions to Fouque concerning burial are given. Note the final utilization of the \\\"high place\\\" motif in the burial of Julien. The cell has been the scene of his last happiness, and the heights culminate this representation beyond death. It is fitting that Mathilde be portrayed in this macabre scene retrieving Julien's head. It permits her to play the final scene in the drama from the past which she has re-enacted in her affair with Julien. There is likewise a kind of poetic justice attained thereby -- her \\\"amour de tete\\\" is recompensed. One wonders at the future of Mathilde de la Mole. Stendhal has hinted in a previous chapter that Frilair's attempts to replace Julien had not yet been noticed by Mathilde. As for Mme. de Renal, her death is the logical consequence of her character and conduct. She and Julien have shared a more vital identity. Mathilde and Mme. de Renal, each reflecting aspects of Julien, are complementary.\"}","chapter":"CHAPTER LXXIII\n\n\nWhen he was deep asleep an hour afterwards, he was woken up by feeling\ntears flow over his hand. \"Oh, it is Mathilde again,\" he thought, only\nhalf awake. \"She has come again, faithful to her tactics of attacking\nmy resolution by her sentimentalism.\" Bored by the prospect of this\nnew scene of hackneyed pathos he did not open his eyes. The verses of\nBelphgor, as he ran away from his wife, came into his mind. He heard a\nstrange sigh. He opened his eyes. It was madame de Renal.\n\n\"Ah, so I see you again before I die, or is it an illusion,\" he\nexclaimed as he threw himself at her feet.\n\n\"But, forgive me, madame, you must look upon me as a mere murderer,\" he\nsaid, immediately, as he recovered himself.\n\n\"Monsieur, I have come to entreat you to appeal; I know you do not want\nto....\" her sobs choked her; she was unable to speak.\n\n\"Deign to forgive me.\"\n\n\"If you want me to forgive you,\" she said to him, getting up and\nthrowing herself into his arms, \"appeal immediately against your death\nsentence.\"\n\nJulien covered her with kisses.\n\n\"Will you come and see me every day during those two months?\"\n\n\"I swear it--every day, unless my husband forbids me.\"\n\n\"I will sign it,\" exclaimed Julien.\n\n\"What! you really forgive me! Is it possible?\"\n\nHe clasped her in his arms; he was mad. She gave a little cry.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" she said to him. \"You hurt me.\"\n\n\"Your shoulder,\" exclaimed Julien, bursting into tears. He drew back\na little, and covered her hands with kisses of fire. \"Who could\nhave prophesied this, dear, the last time I saw you in your room at\nVerrieres?\"\n\n\"Who could have prophesied then that I should write that infamous\nletter to M. de la Mole?\"\n\n\"Know that I have always loved you, and that I have never loved anyone\nbut you.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Madame de Renal, who was delighted in her turn.\nShe leant on Julien, who was on his knees, and they cried silently for\na long time.\n\nJulien had never experienced moments like this at any period of his\nwhole life.\n\n\"And how about that young madame Michelet?\" said Madame de Renal, a\nlong time afterwards when they were able to speak. \"Or rather, that\nmademoiselle de la Mole? for I am really beginning to believe in that\nstrange romance.\"\n\n\"It is only superficially true,\" answered Julien. \"She is my wife, but\nshe is not my mistress.\"\n\nAfter interrupting each other a hundred times over, they managed with\ngreat difficulty to explain to each other what they did not know. The\nletter written to M. de la Mole had been drafted by the young priest\nwho directed Madame de Renal's conscience, and had been subsequently\ncopied by her, \"What a horrible thing religion has made me do,\" she\nsaid to him, \"and even so I softened the most awful passages in the\nletter.\"\n\nJulien's ecstatic happiness proved the fulness of her forgiveness. He\nhad never been so mad with love.\n\n\"And yet I regard myself as devout,\" madame de Renal went on to say to\nhim in the ensuing conversation. \"I believe sincerely in God! I equally\nbelieve, and I even have full proof of it, that the crime which I am\ncommitting is an awful one, and yet the very minute I see you, even\nafter you have fired two pistol shots at me--\" and at this point, in\nspite of her resistance, Julien covered her with kisses.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" she continued, \"I want to argue with you, I am\nfrightened lest I should forget.... The very minute I see you all my\nduties disappear. I have nothing but love for you, dear, or rather, the\nword love is too weak. I feel for you what I ought only to feel for\nGod; a mixture of respect, love, obedience.... As a matter of fact, I\ndon't know what you inspire me with.... If you were to tell me to stab\nthe gaoler with a knife, the crime would be committed before I had\ngiven it a thought. Explain this very clearly to me before I leave you.\nI want to see down to the bottom of my heart; for we shall take leave\nof each other in two months.... By the bye, shall we take leave of each\nother?\" she said to him with a smile.\n\n\"I take back my words,\" exclaimed Julien, getting up, \"I shall not\nappeal from my death sentence, if you try, either by poison, knife,\npistol, charcoal, or any other means whatsoever, to put an end to your\nlife, or make any attempt upon it.\"\n\nMadame de Renal's expression suddenly changed. The most lively\ntenderness was succeeded by a mood of deep meditation.\n\n\"Supposing we were to die at once,\" she said to him.\n\n\"Who knows what one will find in the other life,\" answered Julien,\n\"perhaps torment, perhaps nothing at all. Cannot we pass two delicious\nmonths together? Two months means a good many days. I shall never have\nbeen so happy.\"\n\n\"You will never have been so happy?\"\n\n\"Never,\" repeated Julien ecstatically, \"and I am talking to you just as\nI should talk to myself. May God save me from exaggerating.\"\n\n\"Words like that are a command,\" she said with a timid melancholy smile.\n\n\"Well, you will swear by the love you have for me, to make no attempt\neither direct or indirect, upon your life ... remember,\" he added,\n\"that you must live for my son, whom Mathilde will hand over to lackeys\nas soon as she is marquise de Croisenois.\"\n\n\"I swear,\" she answered coldly, \"but I want to take away your notice\nof appeal, drawn and signed by yourself. I will go myself to M. the\nprocureur-general.\"\n\n\"Be careful, you will compromise yourself.\"\n\n\"After having taken the step of coming to see you in your prison, I\nshall be a heroine of local scandal for Besancon, and the whole of\nFranche-Comte,\" she said very dejectedly. \"I have crossed the bounds of\naustere modesty.... I am a woman who has lost her honour; it is true\nthat it is for your sake....\"\n\nHer tone was so sad that Julien embraced her with a happiness which was\nquite novel to him. It was no longer the intoxication of love, it was\nextreme gratitude. He had just realised for the first time the full\nextent of the sacrifice which she had made for him.\n\nSome charitable soul, no doubt informed M. de Renal of the long visits\nwhich his wife paid to Julien's prison; for at the end of three days\nhe sent her his carriage with the express order to return to Verrieres\nimmediately.\n\nThis cruel separation had been a bad beginning for Julien's day. He\nwas informed two or three hours later that a certain intriguing priest\n(who had, however, never managed to make any headway among the Jesuits\nof Besancon) had, since the morning, established himself in the street\noutside the prison gates. It was raining a great deal, and the man out\nthere was pretending to play the martyr. Julien was in a weak mood, and\nthis piece of stupidity annoyed him deeply.\n\nIn the morning, he had already refused this priest's visit, but the man\nhad taken it into his head to confess Julien, and to win a name for\nhimself among the young women of Besancon by all the confidences which\nhe would pretend to have received from him.\n\nHe declared in a loud voice that he would pass the day and the night by\nthe prison gates. \"God has sent me to touch the heart of this apostate\n...\" and the lower classes, who are always curious to see a scene,\nbegan to make a crowd.\n\n\"Yes, my brothers,\" he said to them, \"I will pass the day here and the\nnight, as well as all the days and all the nights which will follow.\nThe Holy Ghost has spoken to me. I am commissioned from above; I am the\nman who must save the soul of young Sorel. Do you join in my prayers,\netc.\"\n\nJulien had a horror of scandal, and of anything which could attract\nattention to him. He thought of seizing the opportunity of escaping\nfrom the world incognito; but he had some hope of seeing madame de\nRenal again, and he was desperately in love.\n\nThe prison gates were situated in one of the most populous streets. His\nsoul was tortured by the idea of this filthy priest attracting a crowd\nand creating a scandal--\"and doubtless he is repeating my name at every\nsingle minute!\" This moment was more painful than death.\n\nHe called the turnkey who was devoted to him, and sent sent him two or\nthree times at intervals of one hour to see if the priest was still by\nthe prison gates.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the turnkey to him on each occasion, \"he is on both\nhis knees in the mud; he is praying at the top of his voice, and saying\nlitanies for your soul.\n\n\"The impudent fellow,\" thought Julien. At this moment he actually heard\na dull buzz. It was the responses of the people to the litanies. His\npatience was strained to the utmost when he saw the turnkey himself\nmove his lips while he repeated the Latin words.\n\n\"They are beginning to say,\" added the turnkey, \"that you must have a\nvery hardened heart to refuse the help of this holy man.\"\n\n\"Oh my country, how barbarous you still are!\" exclaimed Julien, beside\nhimself with anger. And he continued his train of thought aloud,\nwithout giving a thought to the turn-key's presence.\n\n\"The man wants an article in the paper about him, and that's a way in\nwhich he will certainly get it.\n\n\"Oh you cursed provincials! At Paris I should not be subjected to all\nthese annoyances. There they are more skilled in their charlatanism.\n\n\"Show in the holy priest,\" he said at last to the turnkey, and great\nstreams of sweat flowed down his forehead. The turnkey made the sign of\nthe cross and went out rejoicing.\n\nThe holy priest turned out to be very ugly, he was even dirtier than he\nwas ugly. The cold rain intensified the obscurity and dampness of the\ncell. The priest wanted to embrace Julien, and began to wax pathetic as\nhe spoke to him. The basest hypocrisy was only too palpable; Julien had\nnever been so angry in his whole life.\n\nA quarter of an hour after the priest had come in Julien felt an\nabsolute coward. Death appeared horrible to him for the first time. He\nbegan to think about the state of decomposition which his body would be\nin two days after the execution, etc., etc.\n\nHe was on the point of betraying himself by some sign of weakness or\nthrowing himself on the priest and strangling him with his chain, when\nit occurred to him to beg the holy man to go and say a good forty franc\nmass for him on that very day.\n\nIt was twelve o'clock, so the priest took himself off.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV\n\n\nAs soon as he had gone out Julien wept desperately and for a long time.\nHe gradually admitted to himself that if madame de Renal had been at\nBesancon he would have confessed his weakness to her. The moment when\nhe was regretting the absence of this beloved woman he heard Mathilde's\nstep.\n\n\"The worst evil of being in prison,\" he thought \"is one's inability to\nclose one's door.\" All Mathilde said only irritated him.\n\nShe told him that M. de Valenod had had his nomination to the\nprefectship in his pocket on the day of his trial, and had consequently\ndared to defy M. de Frilair and give himself the pleasure of condemning\nhim to death.\n\n\"Why did your friend take it into his head,\" M. de Frilair just said\nto me, \"to awaken and attack the petty vanity of that bourgeois\naristocracy. Why talk about caste? He pointed out to them what they\nought to do in their own political interest; the fools had not been\ngiving it a thought and were quite ready to weep. That caste interest\nintervened and blinded their eyes to the horror of condemning a man to\ndeath. One must admit that M. Sorel is very inexperienced. If we do not\nsucceed in saving him by a petition for a reprieve, his death will be a\nkind of suicide.\"\n\nMathilde was careful not to tell Julien a matter concerning which she\nhad now no longer any doubts; it was that the abbe de Frilair seeing\nthat Julien was ruined, had thought that it would further his ambitious\nprojects to try and become his successor.\n\n\"Go and listen to a mass for me,\" he said to Mathilde, almost beside\nhimself with vexation and impotent rage, and leave me a moment in\npeace. Mathilde who was already very jealous of madame de Renal's\nvisits and who had just learned of her departure realised the cause of\nJulien's bad temper and burst into tears.\n\nHer grief was real; Julien saw this and was only the more irritated. He\nhad a crying need of solitude, and how was he to get it?\n\nEventually Mathilde, after having tried to melt him by every possible\nargument, left him alone. But almost at the same moment, Fouque\npresented himself.\n\n\"I need to be alone,\" he said, to this faithful friend, and as he saw\nhim hesitate: \"I am composing a memorial for my petition for pardon ...\none thing more ... do me a favour, and never speak to me about death.\nIf I have need of any especial services on that day, let me be the\nfirst to speak to you about it.\"\n\nWhen Julien had eventually procured solitude, he found himself more\nprostrate and more cowardly than he had been before. The little force\nwhich this enfeebled soul still possessed had all been spent in\nconcealing his condition from mademoiselle de la Mole.\n\nTowards the evening he found consolation in this idea.\n\n\"If at the very moment this morning, when death seemed so ugly to\nme, I had been given notice of my execution, the public eye would\nhave acted as a spur to glory, my demeanour would perhaps have had a\ncertain stiffness about it, like a nervous fop entering a salon. A few\npenetrating people, if there are any amongst these provincial might\nhave managed to divine my weakness.... But no one would have seen it.\"\n\nAnd he felt relieved of part of his unhappiness. \"I am a coward at this\nvery moment,\" he sang to himself, \"but no one will know it.\"\n\nAn even more unpleasant episode awaited him on the following day. His\nfather had been announcing that he would come and see him for some time\npast: the old white-haired carpenter appeared in Julien's cell before\nhe woke up.\n\nJulien felt weak, he was anticipating the most unpleasant reproaches.\nHis painful emotion was intensified by the fact that on this particular\nmorning he felt a keen remorse for not loving his father.\n\n\"Chance placed us next to each other in the world,\" he said to himself,\nwhile the turnkey was putting the cell a little in order, \"and we have\npractically done each other all the harm we possibly could. He has come\nto administer the final blow at the moment of my death.\"\n\nAs soon as they were without witnesses, the old man commenced his stern\nreproaches.\n\nJulien could not restrain his tears. \"What an unworthy weakness,\" he\nsaid to himself querulously. \"He will go about everywhere exaggerating\nmy lack of courage: what a triumph for the Valenod, and for all the\nfatuous hypocrites who rule in Verrieres! They are very great in\nFrance, they combine all the social advantages. But hitherto, I could\nat any rate say to myself, it is true they are in receipt of money, and\nthat all the honours lavished on them, but I have a noble heart.\n\n\"But here is a witness whom everyone will believe, and who will testify\nto the whole of Verrieres that I shewed weakness when confronted with\ndeath, and who will exaggerate it into the bargain! I shall be taken\nfor a coward in an ordeal which comes home to all!\"\n\nJulien was nearly desperate. He did not know how to get rid of his\nfather. He felt it absolutely beyond his strength to invent a ruse\ncapable of deceiving so shrewd an old man.\n\nHis mind rapidly reviewed all the alternatives. \"I have saved some\nmoney,\" he suddenly exclaimed.\n\nThis inspiration produced a change in the expression of the old man and\nin Julien's own condition.\n\n\"How ought I to dispose of it?\" continued Julien more quietly. The\nresult had freed him from any feeling of inferiority.\n\nThe old carpenter was burning not to let the money slip by him, but\nit seemed that Julien wanted to leave part of it to his brothers. He\ntalked at length and with animation. Julien felt cynical.\n\n\"Well, the Lord has given me a message with regard to my will. I will\ngive a thousand francs to each of my brothers and the rest to you.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the old man. \"The rest is due to me: but since God\nhas been gracious enough to touch your heart, your debts ought to be\npaid if you wish to die like a good Christian. There are, moreover, the\nexpenses of your board and your education, which I advanced to you,\nbut which you are not thinking of.\"\n\n\"Such is paternal love,\" repeated Julien to himself, dejectedly, when\nhe was at last alone. Soon the gaoler appeared.\n\n\"Monsieur, I always bring my visitors a good bottle of champagne after\nnear relations have come to see them. It is a little dear, six francs a\nbottle, but it rejoices the heart.\"\n\n\"Bring three glasses,\" said Julien to him, with a childish eagerness,\n\"and bring in two of the prisoners whom I have heard walking about\nin the corridor.\" The gaoler brought two men into him who had once\nbeen condemned to the gallows, and had now been convicted of the same\noffence again, and were preparing to return to penal servitude. They\nwere very cheerful scoundrels, and really very remarkable by reason of\ntheir subtlety, their courage, and their coolness.\n\n\"If you give me twenty francs,\" said one of them to Julien, \"I will\ntell you the story of my life in detail. It's rich.\"\n\n\"But you will lie,\" said Julien.\n\n\"Not me,\" he answered, \"my friend there, who is jealous of my twenty\nfrancs will give me away if I say anything untrue.\"\n\nHis history was atrocious. It was evidence of a courageous heart which\nhad only one passion--that of money.\n\nAfter their departure Julien was no longer the same man. All his anger\nwith himself had disappeared. The awful grief which had been poisoned\nand rendered more acute by the weakness of which he had been a victim\nsince madame de Renal's departure had turned to melancholy.\n\n\"If I had been less taken in by appearances,\" he said to himself, \"I\nwould have had a better chance of seeing that the Paris salons are full\nof honest men like my father, or clever scoundrels like those felons.\nThey are right. The men in the salons never get up in the morning with\nthis poignant thought in their minds, how am I going to get my dinner?\nThey boast about their honesty and when they are summoned on the jury,\nthey take pride in convicting the man who has stolen a silver dish\nbecause he felt starving.\n\n\"But if there is a court, and it's a question of losing or winning a\nportfolio, my worthy salon people will commit crimes exactly similar to\nthose, which the need of getting a dinner inspired those two felons to\nperpetrate.\n\n\"There is no such thing as natural law, the expression is nothing\nmore than a silly anachronism well worthy of the advocate-general who\nharried me the other day, and whose grandfather was enriched by one of\nthe confiscations of Louis XIV. There is no such thing as right, except\nwhen there is a law to forbid a certain thing under pain of punishment.\n\n\"Before law existed, the only natural thing was the strength of the\nlion, or the need of a creature who was cold or hungry, to put it\nin one word, need. No, the people whom the world honours are merely\nvillains who have had the good fortune not to have been caught\nred-handed. The prosecutor whom society put on my track was enriched by\nan infamous act. I have committed a murder, and I am justly condemned,\nbut the Valenod who has condemned me, is by reason alone of that very\ndeed, a hundred times more harmful to society.\n\n\"Well,\" added Julien sadly but not angrily, \"in spite of his avarice,\nmy father is worth more than all those men. He never loved me.\nThe disgrace I bring upon him by an infamous death has proved the\nlast straw. That fear of lacking money, that distorted view of the\nwickedness of mankind, which is called avarice, make him find a\ntremendous consolation and sense of security in a sum of three or four\nhundred louis, which I have been able to leave him. Some Sunday, after\ndinner, he will shew his gold to all the envious men in Verrieres.\n'Which of you would not be delighted to have a son guillotined at a\nprice like this,' will be the message they will read in his eyes.\"\n\nThis philosophy might be true, but it was of such a character as to\nmake him wish for death. In this way five long days went by. He was\npolite and gentle to Mathilde, whom he saw was exasperated by the\nmost violent jealousy. One evening Julien seriously thought of taking\nhis own life. His soul was demoralised by the deep unhappiness in\nwhich madame de Renal's departure had thrown him. He could no longer\nfind pleasure in anything, either in real life or in the sphere of\nthe imagination. Lack of exercise began to affect his health, and\nto produce in him all the weakness and exaltation of a young German\nstudent. He began to lose that virile disdain which repels with a\ndrastic oath certain undignified ideas which besiege the soul of the\nunhappy.\n\n\"I loved truth.... Where is it? Hypocrisy everywhere or at any rate\ncharlatanism. Even in the most virtuous, even in the greatest,\" and his\nlips assumed an expression of disgust. \"No, man cannot trust man.\"\n\n\"Madame de ---- when she was making a collection for her poor orphans,\nused to tell me that such and such a prince had just given ten louis, a\nsheer lie. But what am I talking about. Napoleon at St. Helena ... Pure\ncharlatanism like the proclamation in favour of the king of Rome.\n\n\"Great God! If a man like that at a time when misfortune ought to\nsummon him sternly to his duty will sink to charlatanism, what is one\nto expect from the rest of the human species?\"\n\n\"Where is truth? In religion. Yes,\" he added, with a bitter smile\nof utter contempt. \"In the mouth of the Maslons, the Frilairs, the\nCastanedes--perhaps in that true Christianity whose priests were not\npaid any more than were the apostles. But St. Paul was paid by the\npleasure of commanding, speaking, getting himself talked about.\"\n\n\"Oh, if there were only a true religion. Fool that I am. I see a Gothic\ncathedral and venerable stained-glass windows, and my weak heart\nconjures up the priest to fit the scene. My soul would understand him,\nmy soul has need of him. I only find a nincompoop with dirty hair.\nAbout as comforting as a chevalier de Beauvoisis.\n\n\"But a true priest, a Massillon, a Fenelon. Massillon sacrificed\nDubois. Saint-Simon's memoirs have spoilt the illusion of Fenelon, but\nhe was a true priest anyway. In those days, tender souls could have a\nplace in the world where they could meet together. We should not then\nhave been isolated. That good priest would have talked to us of God.\nBut what God? Not the one of the Bible, a cruel petty despot, full of\nvindictiveness, but the God of Voltaire, just, good, infinite.\"\n\nHe was troubled by all the memories of that Bible which he knew by\nheart. \"But how on earth, when the deity is three people all at the\nsame time, is one to believe in the great name of GOD, after the\nfrightful way in which our priests have abused it.\"\n\n\"Living alone. What a torture.\"\n\n\"I am growing mad and unreasonable,\" said Julien to himself, striking\nhis forehead. \"I am alone here in this cell, but I have not lived\nalone on earth. I had the powerful idea of duty. The duty which rightly\nor wrongly I laid down for myself, has been to me like the trunk of a\nsolid tree which I could lean on during the storm, I stumbled, I was\nagitated. After all I was only a man, but I was not swept away.\n\n\"It must be the damp air of this cell which made me think of being\nalone.\n\n\"Why should I still play the hypocrite by cursing hypocrisy? It is\nneither death, nor the cell, nor the damp air, but madame de Renal's\nabsence which prostrates me. If, in order to see her at Verrieres, I\nhad to live whole weeks at Verrieres concealed in the cellars of her\nhouse, would I complain?\"\n\n\"The influence of my contemporaries wins the day,\" he said aloud, with\na bitter laugh. \"Though I am talking to myself and within an ace of\ndeath, I still play the hypocrite. Oh you nineteenth century! A hunter\nfires a gun shot in the forest, his quarry falls, he hastens forward\nto seize it. His foot knocks against a two-foot anthill, knocks down\nthe dwelling place of the ants, and scatters the ants and their eggs\nfar and wide. The most philosophic among the ants will never be able to\nunderstand that black, gigantic and terrifying body, the hunter's boot,\nwhich suddenly invaded their home with incredible rapidity, preceded by\na frightful noise, and accompanied by flashes of reddish fire.\"\n\n\"In the same way, death, life and eternity, are very simple things for\nanyone who has organs sufficiently vast to conceive them. An ephemeral\nfly is born at nine o'clock in the morning in the long summer days, to\ndie at five o'clock in the evening. How is it to understand the word\n'night'?\"\n\n\"Give it five more hours of existence, and it will see night, and\nunderstand its meaning.\"\n\n\"So, in my case, I shall die at the age of twenty-three. Give me five\nmore years of life in order to live with madame de Renal.\"\n\nHe began to laugh like Mephistopheles. How foolish to debate these\ngreat problems.\n\n\"(1). I am as hypocritical as though there were someone there to listen\nto me.\n\n\"(2). I am forgetting to live and to love when I have so few days left\nto live. Alas, madame de Renal is absent; perhaps her husband will\nnot let her come back to Besancon any more, to go on compromising her\nhonour.\"\n\n\"That is what makes me lonely, and not the absence of a God who is\njust, good and omnipotent, devoid of malice, and in no wise greedy of\nvengeance.\"\n\n\"Oh, if He did exist. Alas I should fall at His feet. I have deserved\ndeath, I should say to Him, but oh Thou great God, good God, indulgent\nGod, give me back her whom I love!\"\n\nBy this time the night was far advanced. After an hour or two of\npeaceful sleep, Fouque arrived.\n\nJulien felt strongly resolute, like a man who sees to the bottom of his\nsoul.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV\n\n\n\"I cannot play such a trick on that poor abbe Chas-Bernard, as to\nsummon him,\" he said to Fouque: \"it would prevent him from dining for\nthree whole days.--But try and find some Jansenist who is a friend of\nM. Pirard.\"\n\nFouque was impatiently waiting for this suggestion. Julien acquitted\nhimself becomingly of all the duty a man owes to provincial opinion.\nThanks to M. the abbe de Frilair, and in spite of his bad choice of a\nconfessor, Julien enjoyed in his cell the protection of the priestly\ncongregation; with a little more diplomacy he might have managed to\nescape. But the bad air of the cell produced its effect, and his\nstrength of mind diminished. But this only intensified his happiness at\nmadame de Renal's return.\n\n\"My first duty is towards you, my dear,\" she said as she embraced him;\n\"I have run away from Verrieres.\"\n\nJulien felt no petty vanity in his relations with her, and told her all\nhis weaknesses. She was good and charming to him.\n\nIn the evening she had scarcely left the prison before she made the\npriest, who had clung on to Julien like a veritable prey, go to her\naunt's: as his only object was to win prestige among the young women\nwho belonged to good Besancon society, madame de Renal easily prevailed\nupon him to go and perform a novena at the abbey of Bray-le-Haut.\n\nNo words can do justice to the madness and extravagance of Julien's\nlove.\n\nBy means of gold, and by using and abusing the influence of her aunt,\nwho was devout, rich and well-known, madame de Renal managed to see him\ntwice a day.\n\nAt this news, Mathilde's jealousy reached a pitch of positive madness.\nM. de Frilair had confessed to her that all his influence did not go\nso far as to admit of flouting the conventions by allowing her to\nsee her sweetheart more than once every day. Mathilde had madame de\nRenal followed so as to know the smallest thing she did. M. de Frilair\nexhausted all the resources of an extremely clever intellect in order\nto prove to her that Julien was unworthy of her.\n\nPlunged though she was in all these torments, she only loved him the\nmore, and made a horrible scene nearly every day.\n\nJulien wished, with all his might, to behave to the very end like an\nhonourable man towards this poor young girl whom he had so strangely\ncompromised, but the reckless love which he felt for madame de Renal\nswept him away at every single minute. When he could not manage to\npersuade Mathilde of the innocence of her rival's visits by all his\nthin excuses, he would say to himself: \"at any rate the end of the\ndrama ought to be quite near. The very fact of not being able to lie\nbetter will be an excuse for me.\"\n\nMademoiselle de La Mole learnt of the death of the marquis de\nCroisenois. The rich M. de Thaler had indulged in some unpleasant\nremarks concerning Mathilde's disappearance: M. de Croisenois went\nand asked him to recant them: M. de Thaler showed him some anonymous\nletters which had been sent to him, and which were full of details so\nartfully put together that the poor marquis could not help catching a\nglimpse of the truth.\n\nM. de Thaler indulged in some jests which were devoid of all taste.\nMaddened by anger and unhappiness, M. de Croisenois demanded such\nunqualified satisfaction, that the millionaire preferred to fight a\nduel. Stupidity triumphed, and one of the most lovable of men met with\nhis death before he was twenty-four.\n\nThis death produced a strange and morbid impression on Julien's\ndemoralised soul.\n\n\"Poor Croisenois,\" he said to Mathilde, \"really behaved very reasonably\nand very honourably towards us; he had ample ground for hating me and\npicking a quarrel with me, by reason of your indiscretion in your\nmother's salon; for the hatred which follows on contempt is usually\nfrenzied.\"\n\nM. de Croisenois' death changed all Julien's ideas concerning\nMathilde's future. He spent several days in proving to her that she\nought to accept the hand of M. de Luz. \"He is a nervous man, not too\nmuch of a Jesuit, and will doubtless be a candidate,\" he said to her.\n\"He has a more sinister and persevering ambition than poor Croisenois,\nand as there has never been a dukedom in his family, he will be only\ntoo glad to marry Julien Sorel's widow.\"\n\n\"A widow, though, who scorns the grand passions,\" answered Mathilde\ncoldly, \"for she has lived long enough to see her lover prefer to\nher after six months another woman who was the origin of all their\nunhappiness.\"\n\n\"You are unjust! Madame de Renal's visits will furnish my advocate\nat Paris, who is endeavouring to procure my pardon, with the subject\nmatter for some sensational phrases; he will depict the murderer\nhonoured by the attention of his victim. That may produce an\nimpression, and perhaps some day or other, you will see me provide the\nplot of some melodrama or other, etc., etc.\"\n\nA furious and impotent jealousy, a prolonged and hopeless unhappiness\n(for even supposing Julien was saved, how was she to win back his\nheart?), coupled with her shame and anguish at loving this unfaithful\nlover more than ever had plunged mademoiselle de la Mole into a gloomy\nsilence, from which all the careful assiduity of M. de Frilair was as\nlittle able to draw her as the rugged frankness of Fouque.\n\nAs for Julien, except in those moments which were taken up by\nMathilde's presence, he lived on love with scarcely a thought for the\nfuture.\n\n\"In former days,\" Julien said to her, \"when I might have been so happy,\nduring our walks in the wood of Vergy, a frenzied ambition swept my\nsoul into the realms of imagination. Instead of pressing to my heart\nthat charming arm which is so near my lips, the thoughts of my future\ntook me away from you; I was engaged in countless combats which I\nshould have to sustain in order to lay the foundations of a colossal\nfortune. No, I should have died without knowing what happiness was if\nyou had not come to see me in this prison.\"\n\nTwo episodes ruffled this tranquil life. Julien's confessor, Jansenist\nthough he was, was not proof against an intrigue of the Jesuits, and\nbecame their tool without knowing it.\n\nHe came to tell him one day that unless he meant to fall into the awful\nsin of suicide, he ought to take every possible step to procure his\npardon. Consequently, as the clergy have a great deal of influence with\nthe minister of Justice at Paris, an easy means presented itself; he\nought to become converted with all publicity.\n\n\"With publicity,\" repeated Julien. \"Ha, Ha! I have caught you at it--I\nhave caught you as well, my father, playing a part like any missionary.\"\n\n\"Your youth,\" replied the Jansenist gravely, \"the interesting\nappearance which Providence has given you, the still unsolved mystery\nof the motive for your crime, the heroic steps which mademoiselle de\nla Mole has so freely taken on your behalf, everything, up to the\nsurprising affection which your victim manifests towards you, has\ncontributed to make you the hero of the young women of Besancon.\nThey have forgotten everything, even politics, on your account. Your\nconversion will reverberate in their hearts and will leave behind it a\ndeep impression. You can be of considerable use to religion, and I was\nabout to hesitate for the trivial reason that in a similar circumstance\nthe Jesuits would follow a similar course. But if I did, even in the\none case which has escaped their greedy clutches they would still be\nexercising their mischief. The tears which your conversation will\ncause to be shed will annul the poisonous effect of ten editions of\nVoltaire's works.\"\n\n\"And what will be left for me,\" answered Julien, coldly, \"if I despise\nmyself? I have been ambitious; I do not mean to blame myself in any\nway. Further, I have acted in accordance with the code of the age. Now\nI am living from day to day. But I should make myself very unhappy\nif I were to yield to what the locality would regard as a piece of\ncowardice....\"\n\nMadame de Renal was responsible for the other episode which affected\nJulien in quite another way. Some intriguing woman friend or other had\nmanaged to persuade this naive and timid soul that it was her duty\nto leave for St. Cloud, and go and throw herself at the feet of King\nCharles X.\n\nShe had made the sacrifice of separating from Julien, and after\na strain as great as that, she no longer thought anything of the\nunpleasantness of making an exhibition of herself, though in former\ntimes she would have thought that worse than death.\n\n\"I will go to the king. I will confess freely that you are my lover.\nThe life of a man, and of a man like Julien, too, ought to prevail over\nevery consideration. I will tell him that it was because of jealousy\nthat you made an attempt upon my life. There are numerous instances of\npoor young people who have been saved in such a case by the clemency of\nthe jury or of the king.\"\n\n\"I will leave off seeing you; I will shut myself up in my prison,\"\nexclaimed Julien, \"and you can be quite certain that if you do not\npromise me to take no step which will make a public exhibition of us\nboth, I will kill myself in despair the day afterwards. This idea of\ngoing to Paris is not your own. Tell me the name of the intriguing\nwoman who suggested it to you.\n\n\"Let us be happy during the small number of days of this short life.\nLet us hide our existence; my crime was only too self-evident.\nMademoiselle de la Mole enjoys all possible influence at Paris. Take\nit from me that she has done all that is humanly possible. Here in\nthe provinces I have all the men of wealth and prestige against me.\nYour conduct will still further aggravate those rich and essentially\nmoderate people to whom life comes so easy.... Let us not give the\nMaslons, the Valenods, and the thousand other people who are worth more\nthan they, anything to laugh about.\"\n\nJulien came to find the bad air of the cell unbearable. Fortunately,\nnature was rejoicing in a fine sunshine on the day when they announced\nto him that he would have to die, and he was in a courageous vein.\nHe found walking in the open air as delicious a sensation as the\nnavigator, who has been at sea for a long time, finds walking on the\nground. \"Come on, everything is going all right,\" he said to himself.\n\"I am not lacking in courage.\"\n\nHis head had never looked so poetical as at that moment when it was on\nthe point of falling. The sweet minutes which he had formerly spent in\nthe woods of Vergy crowded back upon his mind with extreme force.\n\nEverything went off simply, decorously, and without any affectation on\nhis part.\n\nTwo days before he had said to Fouque: \"I cannot guarantee not to\nshow some emotion. This dense, squalid cell gives me fits of fever in\nwhich I do not recognise myself, but fear?--no! I shall not be seen to\nflinch.\"\n\nHe had made his arrangements in advance for Fouque to take Mathilde and\nmadame de Renal away on the morning of his last day.\n\n\"Drive them away in the same carriage,\" he had said. \"Do you see that\nthe post-horses do not leave off galloping. They will either fall into\neach other's arms, or manifest towards each other a mortal hatred.\nIn either case the poor women will have something to distract them a\nlittle from their awful grief.\"\n\nJulien had made madame de Renal swear that she would live to look after\nMathilde's son.\n\n\"Who knows? Perhaps we have still some sensations after our death,\" he\nhad said one day to Fouque. \"I should like to rest, for rest is the\nright word, in that little grotto in the great mountain which dominates\nVerrieres. Many a time, as I have told you, I have spent the night\nalone in that grotto, and as my gaze would plunge far and wide over the\nrichest provinces of France, ambition would inflame my heart. In those\ndays it was my passion.... Anyway, I hold that grotto dear, and one\ncannot dispute that its situation might well arouse the desires of the\nphilosopher's soul.... Well, you know! those good priests of Besancon\nwill make money out of everything. If you know how to manage it, they\nwill sell you my mortal remains.\"\n\nFouque succeeded in this melancholy business. He was passing the night\nalone in his room by his friend's body when, to his great surprise, he\nsaw Mathilde come in. A few hours before he had left her ten leagues\nfrom Besancon. Her face and eyes looked distraught.\n\n\"I want to see him,\" she said.\n\nFouque had not the courage either to speak or get up. He pointed with\nhis finger to a big blue cloak on the floor; there was wrapped in it\nall that remained of Julien.\n\nShe threw herself on her knees. The memory of Boniface de la Mole, and\nof Marguerite of Navarre gave her, no doubt, a superhuman courage. Her\ntrembling hands undid the cloak. Fouque turned away his eyes.\n\nHe heard Mathilde walking feverishly about the room. She lit several\ncandles. When Fouque could bring himself to look at her, she had placed\nJulien's head on a little marble table in front of her, and was kissing\nit on the forehead.\n\nMathilde followed her lover to the tomb which he had chosen.

In Chapter 43, the incident of greatest importance is, of course, Mme. de Renal's visit with Julien. Then in almost a sentence, Stendhal indicates that \"three days after these visits had been taking place,\" M. de Renal recalls her home. The end of the chapter elaborates another short incident, the interview of the priest, and Chapter 44 opens with the immediate reaction of Julien after the priest has left. This is typical of Stendhal's treatment of time and events. A single chapter develops one incident , culminates it , and introduces a second . The long-awaited event is the reunion of Mme. de Renal with Julien. Stendhal tells us that Julien has never known such happiness, although the author's \"pudeur\" prevents him, as usual, from elaborating the ecstatic happiness that both enjoy during this supreme moment. He passes over it with: \"much later, when they were able to speak.\" Mme. de Renal loves Julien as a human should love only God. This is no doubt the love that Stendhal would have wanted to receive. Mme. de Renal's sadness and admission of her disgrace prompt a \"new happiness\" in Julien. In Stendhal's conception of love, one constantly makes new discoveries in the object, which increases one's love for her. We are now aware of the extent of Julien's love for Mme. de Renal and of how instrumental it has been in his calm acceptance of the death penalty up to this point. Imagining himself bereft of her love, Julien was prepared for death. Now, a new possibility of happiness opens up before him, and he will really know the terror of the condemned man. The priest's visit serves to materialize Julien's despair, and thereafter, he sees death as horrible. It was no doubt Stendhal's \"pudeur\" that prevented him from giving titles to the last four chapters in the original version of the novel. It is as if the suggestion of privacy were thus made after Julien has been condemned to death. Within one short chapter, Julien moves from the heights of bliss to the depths of despair. Weeping about his own death, Julien will be visited, in Chapter 44, by three more \"misfortunes\": the visits of Mathilde and of his father, and exposure to the criminals with whom he shares a bottle of champagne. From these he will draw food for meditation. During these meditations, the reader will witness, for the last time, Julien's solitude. There exists in this chapter the same movement as in the preceding one, but in reverse: From the depths of despair, Julien will emerge \"strong and resolute, as a man who sees clearly into his own heart.\" Julien finally learns about the machinations of Mathilde and Frilair. The latter, no doubt in an effort to mitigate the betrayal he has suffered personally from Valenod, has tried to shift the blame for Julien's conviction to Julien himself. Frilair sees the courtroom oration as an invitation for condemnation to death. Julien has great difficulty in concealing his despair from Mathilde. His remark concerning the prisoner's public situation vis-a-vis the world sets the tone for the chapter. Just as in life outside, Julien is forced to adopt a hypocritical air in dealing with his visitors to protect what remains of his courage. The interlude of the prisoners is at once a moment of respite, of relief -- an escape from the horror of the present moment -- thereby permitting Julien to transform his self-reproach and grief into a more objective melancholy, and a pendant to the visit by his father. Both incidents are inspirational to his musings in the latter part of the chapter. The prisoner episode is reminiscent of the appearance of Geronomo at the Renal home in Part I, which constituted a sort of poetic escape from the misfortunes of the family. Here, there is a more macabre note. Greed for money has motivated the life of this criminal, otherwise endowed with a brave heart. Thus taken out of himself, Julien is able to recapture the necessary detachment to arrive at the re-creation of the required attitude before death. From Julien's meditations result some of the very important ingredients of beylism: the need to see man for what he is, not to be taken in, not to betray one's real nature; the danger of trading the present moment of happiness, so hard to come by, for sterile meditations about the unfathomable; in the absence of any ethical basis of society, the necessity of the creation of and adherence to a private code of morality based upon duty toward oneself. Five days elapsed during Chapter 44. Stendhal terminates his novel with rapidity. One would be hard put to say over what extent of time the action takes place in the final chapter. It opens as a continuation of the final scene of the preceding chapter: Fouque awakens Julien, the latter having regained his composure and resolution. Stendhal is winding up, moving from Julien's relationship to Mme. de Renal, to Mathilde, almost without transition. Julien admits to Mme. de Renal that he mistook, at the time, the real happiness he had known with her in Vergy. Mathilde is insanely jealous of Mme. de Renal's visits, and Julien's own role toward Mathilde has now become almost paternal, just as Mme. de Renal's love for him still has a maternal character. Stendhal's refusal to indulge in hyperbolic description and pathos is evidenced by his very sparse treatment of the execution of Julien, which has been termed literary euthanasia. We are told that the weather was beautiful and that Julien was poetic, courageous, observant of decorum. Stendhal even makes Julien \"speak\" after the narration of his death, as instructions to Fouque concerning burial are given. Note the final utilization of the \"high place\" motif in the burial of Julien. The cell has been the scene of his last happiness, and the heights culminate this representation beyond death. It is fitting that Mathilde be portrayed in this macabre scene retrieving Julien's head. It permits her to play the final scene in the drama from the past which she has re-enacted in her affair with Julien. There is likewise a kind of poetic justice attained thereby -- her \"amour de tete\" is recompensed. One wonders at the future of Mathilde de la Mole. Stendhal has hinted in a previous chapter that Frilair's attempts to replace Julien had not yet been noticed by Mathilde. As for Mme. de Renal, her death is the logical consequence of her character and conduct. She and Julien have shared a more vital identity. Mathilde and Mme. de Renal, each reflecting aspects of Julien, are complementary.","summary_length":332.0,"analysis_length":1131.0,"chap_int":45,"previous summary id":["part 2, chapter 44"],"previous chapter":["After Madame de Renal has left his cell, Julien can hear Mathilde coming to visit.

Antipholus is still at the marketplace. He fumes about how he'll give it to everyone once he's bailed out, and he spots E. Dromio just in time to think he's saved. When E. Dromio relates that all he's brought is a piece of rope , E. Dromio receives a beating. E. Dromio laments that this is his usual undeserved payment, but doesn't mention that E. Antipholus never asked him for any bail money. Adriana, Luciana, the Courtesan, and a schoolmaster named Pinch all enter the scene. This is reason enough for E. Antipholus to again beat E. Dromio, at which point all the women descend on E. Antipholus, treating him like he's a raging lunatic. They plead with Pinch, who is a schoolmaster and a conjurer, to exorcise whatever demon possesses E. Antipholus. Now E. Antipholus starts beating Pinch as well. Everyone's stories then begin to work against each other, as E. Antipholus insists that he's not mad. He asks whether this witch-doctor is the man Adriana dined with, and the reason he was locked out of his own house. Adriana insists that E. Antipholus was at dinner, and E. Antipholus and E. Dromio insist they were not. E. Antipholus also is a bit unhappy about being arrested. Adriana promises she sent the bail money via Dromio. Poor E. Dromio is certain that he was neither asked to bring the money, nor given any money, and he certainly didn't deliver the money, as everyone is sure of. Basically, everyone seems crazy, and Pinch concludes the men are possessed and must be bound and put into a dark room for their own good. E. Antipholus is driven into greater fury - he declares his wife a false harlot, and promises to pluck out her eyes with his bare hands. After a bit of a scuffle, E. Dromio is tied up, and he and E. Antipholus are taken away. Adriana then tries to deal with her husband's debt. The officer explains the debt was called in by Angelo the goldsmith for a certain necklace. Adriana notes she never got the necklace her husband had spoken of, and this is when the Courtesan pipes up. The Courtesan says E. Antipholus ran into her house and took a ring from her, promising a gold chain in return. She says she saw Antipholus earlier, wearing the chain. Adriana, confused, and not the recipient of the chain, asks to be taken to Angelo the goldsmith to hear the whole truth. Before they can all leave, S. Antipholus runs in with his sword drawn and S. Dromio in tow. Luciana speaks, shocked that the men are loose again. Adriana decides they should run off and get help to tie the men up again. As the officer runs off with the women, S. Antipholus and S. Dromio are left alone, marveling at the fact that these \\\"witches\\\" fear their swords. S. Antipholus hurriedly tells S. Dromio to go grab their things from the Centaur inn so they can leave Ephesus quickly. S. Dromio thinks out loud that S. Antipholus might be being a bit hasty about departing. After all, everyone's so nice to them, and gives them gifts of gold. In fact, if it weren't for \\\"the mountain of mad flesh\\\" that wanted to mount him , S. Dromio might be happy to stay. S. Antipholus insists on leaving ASAP.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"SCENE IV.\n\nA street.\n\n  _Enter _ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus_ and the _Officer_._\n\n_Ant.

Antipholus is still at the marketplace, waiting for S. Dromio to come tell him about whether any ships are leaving. S.

He's convinced the place is overrun with sorcery, and his mind is being played with. S. Dromio then arrives with the gold to pay E. Antipholus's debt, and tries to give it to S. Antipholus. S. Dromio then has to explain to the confused S. Antipholus that he was recently arrested, which one would think a person would remember. S. Antipholus, however, just wants to know about the ships he asked S. Dromio to look for. He is certain he already told S. Antipholus about a departing ship a long time ago, only to be told to bring money for bail instead. S. Antipholus, rather than investigate the matter further, simply declares the two of them seem insane as they wander in an illusion. A Courtesan enters, seeming another vision of the devil. Of course she's familiar with E. Antipholus, but S. Antipholus only recognizes in her the usual courtesanly stuff--gaudy but sweet temptation. S. Antipholus and S. Dromio joke happily about light, which they pun on. They call the Courtesan light, as the devil himself was an angel of light, and they also twist the notion that the woman is \"light,\" meaning \"easy.\" Finally, they decide that she is light like fire, which will burn. Anyway, the Courtesan talks about the dinner she just had with E. Antipholus, where he took a ring from her worth forty ducats, and promised her a gold chain in exchange. She notes S. Antipholus wears the chain, but when she asks for it, or her ring back, he runs away. The Courtesan, out a ring and a customer, decides she'll go to his wife, which is a dangerous but useful tactic.

Dromio of Syracuse dashes up to him, carrying the gold that Adriana sent to free Antipholus of Ephesus from jail. This Antipholus, of course, has no idea why his servant is bringing him money and immediately asks Dromio whether there are ships in the harbor on which they can book passage out of Ephesus. As master and slave converse, the Courtesan, at whose home Antipholus of Ephesus ate dinner, comes upon them and asks Antipholus S. for a ring that he borrowed from her during the meal. He and Dromio decide that she is a witch and flee, leaving the Courtesan convinced that he is mad. She resolves to go to Adriana's home and tell her that her husband has stolen the ring and demand repayment. Meanwhile, Dromio of Ephesus encounters Antipholus of Ephesus in an officer's custody. His master demands to know where the money is to pay his way out of jail; Dromio, baffled, replies that he has brought the rope's end that Antipholus had earlier sent him to buy. Antipholus flies into a rage and tries to assault his slave, halting only at the sudden appearance of Adriana, Luciana, the Courtesan, and a would-be sorcerer named Doctor Pinch. The women plan to have the doctor use exorcism to cure Antipholus' supposed madness. Antipholus protests, and he argues with Adriana: she claims that he dined at home, while her husband  tells her that he was shut out of his own house. Pinch declares that both master and slave are mad, and they are bound and taken to Adriana's house; Adriana promises the officer to make good all her husband's debts. He tells her that Antipholus owes money to Angelo the goldsmith for a gold chain, and the Courtesan says that she saw Antipholus with the item; Adriana, of course, has never seen the chain. As they talk, Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse rush in with drawn swords, and everyone else flees, mistaking them for Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus, who, they assume, have escaped from Pinch. Remarking that even witches are afraid of swords, the Syracusan Antipholus orders his slave to take their belongings on board a ship.\", \"analysis\": \"iv - Commentary The portrait of Ephesus as a place of enchantments continues through these scenes. Antipholus of Ephesus' bafflement at being hailed on the street by complete strangers leads him to comment that \\\"sure, these are but imaginary wiles, \/ and Lapland sorcerers inhabit here .\\\" His decision to blame \\\"Lapland sorcerers,\\\" however, seems to mask a deeper insecurity, since his reference to \\\"imaginary wiles\\\"  suggests that he may be beginning to doubt his own sanity. As his sense of self erodes, his hysteria mounts and his panic at the Courtesan's rather innocuous words and subsequent decision to run around with a drawn sword suggests a man teetering on the brink of panic. But, as the confusing events multiply and the conflicting stories offered by Antipholus of Ephesus and Adriana come into conflict , even the Ephesians themselves become convinced that magic is afoot--or, rather, madness that can be cured by magic. The magic is absurd rather than sinister, however: Antipholus of Syracuse's forebodings about sorcerers and witches are realized only in the ludicrous mountebank Doctor Pinch, whose incantation ) reminds the audience of the blurred lines that define the setting--he offers a Christian prayer in a supposedly pre-Christian city. The character of the Doctor--who is described, somewhat oddly, as a schoolmaster and a conjurer--defines the comic tone of the play. In Shakespeare's tragedies , magic is a destructive force; here, sorcery is a hobby of schoolteachers and, ultimately, a sham.\"}","chapter":"SCENE III.\n\nA public place.\n\n  _Enter _ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse_._\n\n_Ant.

Thou gaoler, thou,\nI am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them\nTo make a rescue?\n\n_Off._          Masters, let him go:\nHe is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.\n\n_Pinch._ Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.                  110\n\n    [_They offer to bind Dro.

Sister, go you with me.\n    [_Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan._]\nSay now; whose suit is he arrested at?\n\n_Off._ One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?\n\n_Adr._ I know the man.

Antipholus of Ephesus' bafflement at being hailed on the street by complete strangers leads him to comment that \"sure, these are but imaginary wiles, \/ and Lapland sorcerers inhabit here .\" His decision to blame \"Lapland sorcerers,\" however, seems to mask a deeper insecurity, since his reference to \"imaginary wiles\"  suggests that he may be beginning to doubt his own sanity. As his sense of self erodes, his hysteria mounts and his panic at the Courtesan's rather innocuous words and subsequent decision to run around with a drawn sword suggests a man teetering on the brink of panic. But, as the confusing events multiply and the conflicting stories offered by Antipholus of Ephesus and Adriana come into conflict , even the Ephesians themselves become convinced that magic is afoot--or, rather, madness that can be cured by magic. The magic is absurd rather than sinister, however: Antipholus of Syracuse's forebodings about sorcerers and witches are realized only in the ludicrous mountebank Doctor Pinch, whose incantation ) reminds the audience of the blurred lines that define the setting--he offers a Christian prayer in a supposedly pre-Christian city. The character of the Doctor--who is described, somewhat oddly, as a schoolmaster and a conjurer--defines the comic tone of the play. In Shakespeare's tragedies , magic is a destructive force; here, sorcery is a hobby of schoolteachers and, ultimately, a sham.","summary_length":391.0,"analysis_length":243.0,"chap_int":4,"previous summary id":["act iv, scene iii"],"previous chapter":["S. Antipholus is still at the marketplace, waiting for S. Dromio to come tell him about whether any ships are leaving. S. Antipholus wonders at his good luck; it seems everyone in the whole city knows him and is kind to him, though he has no idea who they are. He's convinced the place is overrun with sorcery, and his mind is being played with. S. Dromio then arrives with the gold to pay E. Antipholus's debt, and tries to give it to S. Antipholus. S. Dromio then has to explain to the confused S. Antipholus that he was recently arrested, which one would think a person would remember. S. Antipholus, however, just wants to know about the ships he asked S. Dromio to look for. He is certain he already told S. Antipholus about a departing ship a long time ago, only to be told to bring money for bail instead. S. Antipholus, rather than investigate the matter further, simply declares the two of them seem insane as they wander in an illusion. A Courtesan enters, seeming another vision of the devil. Of course she's familiar with E. Antipholus, but S. Antipholus only recognizes in her the usual courtesanly stuff--gaudy but sweet temptation. S. Antipholus and S. Dromio joke happily about light, which they pun on. They call the Courtesan light, as the devil himself was an angel of light, and they also twist the notion that the woman is \"light,\" meaning \"easy.\" Finally, they decide that she is light like fire, which will burn. Anyway, the Courtesan talks about the dinner she just had with E. Antipholus, where he took a ring from her worth forty ducats, and promised her a gold chain in exchange. She notes S. Antipholus wears the chain, but when she asks for it, or her ring back, he runs away. The Courtesan, out a ring and a customer, decides she'll go to his wife, which is a dangerous but useful tactic. The Courtesan is sure Antipholus is mad, and she intends to tell Adriana that Antipholus ran into her house and stole her valuable ring."],"next summary id":"act 4, scenes 3-4","next chapter":"Antipholus of Syracuse, exploring the city, remarks that people he has never met are continually greeting him, thanking him for favors, showing him goods he has ordered, and so on.

Flamineo follows them. Flamineo tells Vittoria to stop praying if that's what she's doing, and listen to him--he has worldly business to discuss. He demands money from her, since she is the executor of the Brachiano's will . She writes out a tiny sum, saying she'll only give him what Cain received after he killed Abel. . Flamineo says he has cases of jewels left by Brachiano that are worth more than she gave him--he'll bring them in a moment. He exits. Zanche tells Vittoria to try to calm Flamineo down, since he's clearly desperate. Flamineo re-enters with two cases of pistols. Flamineo tells Vittoria he's going to kill--this, he claims, is what Brachiano told him to do, being jealous that Vittoria would get with someone else. Flamineo is then going to commit suicide, voluntarily. Vittoria asks Flamineo if he's become an atheist and doesn't mind going to hell. How can he avoid thinking about the millions who will arise to damnation at the resurrection? She also tells Zanche to cry for help--when she does, Flamineo threatens to kill her too. Flamineo says these arguments don't move him--they're feminine and emotional. Zanche tells Vittoria to pretend to agree to die, but to convince Flamineo to kill himself first. She makes her case and it seems to work. Flamineo gives them the guns. He speculates on where he'll go in the afterlife, somewhat comically. They shoot, and run towards him, treading on his body. As Flamineo \\\"dies\\\" he asks them to kill themselves. They reveal that they faked him out. As Vittoria triumphantly believes she's sending him to hell, she makes scornful comments condemning him as he acts like he's smelling the soot and feeling the flames of hell as he dies. But Flamineo gets up and reveals that the pistols weren't really loaded with bullets. He was just testing Vittoria's loyalty. He now says he'll live to punish her for betraying him and warns men against wives who will betray them in the same kind of way, taking lovers as soon as they've died. Suddenly, Lodovico and Gasparo bust in, announcing that they're there to avenge Isabella. Flamineo finally recognizes who they really are. They admit that Mulinassar was really Francisco, visiting for vengeance. Flamineo laments that his fate has caught up with him. He claims it's better to just have good fortune than to gain wisdom. Vittoria pleads for mercy--but Gasparo says it's not going to happen. And Lodovico points out that he's getting back at Flamineo for the time he hit him. Flamineo refuses to beg to heaven out loud and when Lodovico asks him what's he's thinking about at the end, he says he's thinking of nothing. Vittoria tells them to kill her before Zanche. She speaks very defiantly, claiming she's unafraid to die. Zanche is defiant, too. Gasparo and Lodovico strike at once and kill all three. Vittoria cheekily says that, now, all Lodovico and Gasparo have to do to get famous is murder some innocent baby. As she dies Vittoria laments her family's sins, claiming that's why she was led astray. Flamineo says he loves his sister's bravery--she's not so bad, he says, since many women that seemed virtuous were really secretly vicious. Vittoria expresses confusion as to where her soul is headed, in death. Flamineo gives a speech, saying that death just frees us from dying and from being fortune's slaves. He refuses to look to heaven as he dies, looking only to himself. Yet he feels like he's \\\"in a mist.\\\" Vittoria dies after saying she regrets having ever met \\\"great men.\\\" Flamineo's speech continues: he warns people not to be too hopeful about life, especially if they serve great men. He admits that his life was a \\\"black charnel\\\" and says that it all seems utterly pointless and painful. He dies. Giovanni enters with the ambassadors. He asks Lodovico if he's responsible for these deaths. Lodovico admits it and says that he was acting under orders of Giovanni's own uncle, Francisco, who was the same Moor who had infiltrated the court . Giovanni orders Lodovico off to torture and execution. Lodovico says that he's extremely happy he was able to commit this act of revenge, and will find torture and the gallows as calm and soothing as sound sleep. Giovanni speaks the last line in the play, warning guilty men against committing evil, since evil deeds can quickly collapse and ruin the people who committed them.\", \"analysis\": \"\"}","chapter":"SCENE VI\n\n\nEnter Vittoria with a book in her hand, Zanche; Flamineo following them\n\n\nFlam.

To most assur'd damnation?\n\n\nVit.   Oh, thou most cursed devil!\n\n\nZan.   Thou art caught----\n\n\nVit.   In thine own engine.  I tread the fire out\n  That would have been my ruin.\n\n\nFlam.

Flamineo follows them. Flamineo tells Vittoria to stop praying if that's what she's doing, and listen to him--he has worldly business to discuss. He demands money from her, since she is the executor of the Brachiano's will . She writes out a tiny sum, saying she'll only give him what Cain received after he killed Abel. . Flamineo says he has cases of jewels left by Brachiano that are worth more than she gave him--he'll bring them in a moment. He exits. Zanche tells Vittoria to try to calm Flamineo down, since he's clearly desperate. Flamineo re-enters with two cases of pistols. Flamineo tells Vittoria he's going to kill--this, he claims, is what Brachiano told him to do, being jealous that Vittoria would get with someone else. Flamineo is then going to commit suicide, voluntarily. Vittoria asks Flamineo if he's become an atheist and doesn't mind going to hell. How can he avoid thinking about the millions who will arise to damnation at the resurrection? She also tells Zanche to cry for help--when she does, Flamineo threatens to kill her too. Flamineo says these arguments don't move him--they're feminine and emotional. Zanche tells Vittoria to pretend to agree to die, but to convince Flamineo to kill himself first. She makes her case and it seems to work. Flamineo gives them the guns. He speculates on where he'll go in the afterlife, somewhat comically. They shoot, and run towards him, treading on his body. As Flamineo \"dies\" he asks them to kill themselves. They reveal that they faked him out. As Vittoria triumphantly believes she's sending him to hell, she makes scornful comments condemning him as he acts like he's smelling the soot and feeling the flames of hell as he dies. But Flamineo gets up and reveals that the pistols weren't really loaded with bullets. He was just testing Vittoria's loyalty. He now says he'll live to punish her for betraying him and warns men against wives who will betray them in the same kind of way, taking lovers as soon as they've died. Suddenly, Lodovico and Gasparo bust in, announcing that they're there to avenge Isabella. Flamineo finally recognizes who they really are. They admit that Mulinassar was really Francisco, visiting for vengeance. Flamineo laments that his fate has caught up with him. He claims it's better to just have good fortune than to gain wisdom. Vittoria pleads for mercy--but Gasparo says it's not going to happen. And Lodovico points out that he's getting back at Flamineo for the time he hit him. Flamineo refuses to beg to heaven out loud and when Lodovico asks him what's he's thinking about at the end, he says he's thinking of nothing. Vittoria tells them to kill her before Zanche. She speaks very defiantly, claiming she's unafraid to die. Zanche is defiant, too. Gasparo and Lodovico strike at once and kill all three. Vittoria cheekily says that, now, all Lodovico and Gasparo have to do to get famous is murder some innocent baby. As she dies Vittoria laments her family's sins, claiming that's why she was led astray. Flamineo says he loves his sister's bravery--she's not so bad, he says, since many women that seemed virtuous were really secretly vicious. Vittoria expresses confusion as to where her soul is headed, in death. Flamineo gives a speech, saying that death just frees us from dying and from being fortune's slaves. He refuses to look to heaven as he dies, looking only to himself. Yet he feels like he's \"in a mist.\" Vittoria dies after saying she regrets having ever met \"great men.\" Flamineo's speech continues: he warns people not to be too hopeful about life, especially if they serve great men. He admits that his life was a \"black charnel\" and says that it all seems utterly pointless and painful. He dies. Giovanni enters with the ambassadors. He asks Lodovico if he's responsible for these deaths. Lodovico admits it and says that he was acting under orders of Giovanni's own uncle, Francisco, who was the same Moor who had infiltrated the court . Giovanni orders Lodovico off to torture and execution. Lodovico says that he's extremely happy he was able to commit this act of revenge, and will find torture and the gallows as calm and soothing as sound sleep. Giovanni speaks the last line in the play, warning guilty men against committing evil, since evil deeds can quickly collapse and ruin the people who committed them.","summary_analysis":null,"summary_length":752.0,"analysis_length":1.0,"chap_int":6,"previous summary id":["act 5","act 5, scene 5"],"previous chapter":["Act 5 opens in Padua, where Brachiano and Vittoria have fled. Brachiano and Vittoria cross the stage in a glorious wedding procession, followed by Flamineo, Marcelo, Hortensio, Cornelia, Zanche, and the ambassadors. The party exits, but Flamineo and Hortensio remain behind. Hortensio and Flamineo discuss the Moor, named Mulinassar, who has recently arrived at court, and Flamineo expresses approval of the Moor's experience with state affairs and warfare. His is further pleased that Mulinassar has agreed to aid Brachiano in the impending war with Francisco. He finally explains the presence of the two gentlemen accompanying Mulinassar: they are Hungarian noblemen who are entering a Capuchin monastery after having fought in a crusade. As the audience alone knows, Mulinassar is actually Francisco in disguise, and the Hungarian gentleman are Lodovico, Gasparo, and Antonelli in disguise. Brachiano enters with Mulinassar, the Hungarian gentlemen, Fernese, Carlo, and Pedro. Brachiano welcomes the Moor and asks him to stay for his wedding festivities. Brachiano, Flamineo, and Hortensio leave, and Carlo and Pedro welcome the conspirators. Together, they all discuss how to best kill Brachiano. Hearing Flamineo returning, all the conspirators exit, except for Francisco. Flamineo, Marcello, and Zanche enter. Marcello asks why Zanche follows them, and Flamineo makes an off-color joke about his erection and her ability to end it. Zanche resolves to later speak to her \"countryman\" Mulinassar, and exits the stage. Flamineo asks Mulinassar for some war stories, but the latter refuses to brag about himself. Flamineo then advises the Moor on how to best obtain his payment from Brachiano. Hortensio, a young lord, and Zanche re-enter. The former informs Flamineo that the games are about to begin, and Flamineo then badmouths him behind his back to Mulinassar . Hortensio tells Flamineo that his lover, Zanche, has arrived, and Flamineo admits that they sleep together but also that he cannot trust her. He had promised to marry her, but he now regrets that promise and wants to avoid her. Zanche accuses him of falling out of love with her, and he claims that he is a better lover because his lack of \"heat\" prevents him from contracting venereal disease. When Zanche accuses him of falling in love with the \"painted\" courtiers, he replies that only a fool gives up what he has for what he wants. Cornelia then enters, and immediately assaults Zanche. Flamineo leaps to the Moor's defense, threatening to lock his mother in the stocks. Marcello aids Cornelia, striking Zanche again and calling her a whore. He then explains that she has been bragging that Flamineo will marry her. While the two brothers argue with one other, Mulinassar enters, distracting Zanche. Zanche, clearly attracted to him, admits that she has fallen in love with Flamineo, which he explains is unwise. She promises him a dowry to offset her lack of virtue, and Francisco remarks aside that Zanche's confidence may be very helpful in aiding his schemes. Scene 2 Marcello and Cornelia are together alone on stage. Cornelia confronts her son about court gossip claiming Marcello is set to duel with someone. He denies it, and asks his mother to back off. Suddenly, Flamineo appears brandishing Marcello's sword. He fatally stabs his brother, and leaves. Hortensio, Carlo, and Pedro arrive right after Marcello dies. Cornelia refuses to admit that Marcello is dead, and pleads with Hortensio and Carlo to fetch help. Brachiano enters, sees Marcello dead, and asks Flamineo if he committed the crime. Cornelia, however, asserts that it was Hortensio's crime, since he refused to aid the dying man. Clearly mentally unhinged, she then begs Flamineo for his forgiveness. Brachiano tells Flamineo that he cannot pardon the murder, but will allow a lease on Flamineo's life which the man must renew every evening. While Brachiano delivers this sentence, Lodovico poisons his helmet's mouthpiece, which evokes the method of Isabella's death. Scene 3 As Scene 3 opens, several unnamed knights are engaged in battle as part of the tournament being held to celebrate the wedding. Brachiano, Flamineo, Giovanni, Vittoria, and the disguised Francisco enter. Brachiano desperately calls for an armorer because he feels like his head is on fire. He soon realizes he has been poisoned, and he sends the armorer to be tortured. Doctors arrive and discover the poison is fatal, at which point Brachiano delivers a speech blaming Francisco and Fate\/Death. Lodovico and Gasparo arrive dressed as Franciscan monks, seemingly to deliver the last rites, and all but Mulinassar and Flamineo withdraw. Flamineo remarks how quickly great men lose friends and flatterers once they are in trouble, telling the disguised Francisco that the Duke cared more for money than he did for his subject's lives. Lodovico re-enters to tell them that Brachiano is delirious and dying. Brachiano is then brought in on a bed alongside Vittoria and the disguised murderers. He rails against Vittoria, accusing her of causing him misery. He hallucinates images of the devil and of Flamineo dancing with money on a tightrope. Gasparo and Lodovico begin to hypocritically intone Brachiano's last rites in Latin. They ask everyone to leave so that they may have religious privacy. Once everyone has left, they reveal their true identities to Brachiano, and curse him. He desperately calls for Vittoria, who rushes in but is quickly sent away again by Gasparo and Lodovico. To speed the death, Lodovico strangles Brachiano, and then everyone else re-enters. Flamineo and Mulinassar discuss Brachiano's death; they suggest Francisco as the likely murderer, and Flamineo admits he would like to speak with Brachiano once more. Flamineo exits, and Lodovico enters from the shadows to suggest Francisco manipulate Zanche, who is attracted to him and thinks him a Moor like her, to learn secrets. Zanche and Francisco flirt, talking of their dreams. Francisco claims he had a dream in which he placed a blanket over Zanche's naked body, which tickled her. Zanche then tells Francisco how Isabella and Camillo died, and explains how she and Vittoria are planning to sneak out later that night. She gives the disguised Francisco a dowry, and asks him to meet her later. She exits, only to immediately re-enter to specify that he should meet her at midnight in the chapel. When she finally exits, Francisco explains to Lodovico that they will achieve great glory through their actions, and use that glory to get rid of the crime's taint. Scene 4 Giovanni enters to find Flamineo and Gasparo speaking. Giovanni asks Flamineo to leave him, but Flamineo instead tells a fable emphasizing how great Giovanni can become now that his father is dead and he is \"in the saddle.\" Giovanni chastizes him for insufficient grief, and exits. Flamineo remarks that he does not trust Giovanni, and a courtier enters, telling Flamineo that Giovanni has ordered him to leave court. After the courtier exits, Francisco enters to tell Flamineo that Cornelia is currently distraught and burying Marcello. Cornelia, Zanche, and other assorted women enter. Cornelia, clearly somewhat insane, is murmuring distractedly about flowers for Marcello's grave. She does not recognize Flamineo, although she does call him the \"grave-maker,\" a pun on grave-digger and murderer. She sings a song over Marcello's body in an attempt to bless and protect his grave. She then leaves with the rest of the women, and Flamineo asks Francisco to let him be alone. In a soliloquy, Flamineo contemplates his corrupt life at court and his own failed plans. Suddenly, Brachiano's ghost appears, holding a pot of lilies with a skull buried beneath them. Flamineo unleashes a flurry of questions to the ghost, questioning what hell is like and whether Flamineo will also soon die. The ghost remains silent, but throws dirt on Flamineo, revealing the skull underneath the lilies. Frightened by all the misfortune around him, Flamineo runs off to kill his sister, hoping that will resolve everything. Scene 5 Francisco and Lodovico enter, unaware that Hortensio hides behind them. Lodovico advises Francisco to leave the city before he gets caught or dragged into further evil. Francisco agrees, and promises to immortalize Lodovico's name if the latter dies in carrying out their plan. The two men exit, and Hortensio, now aware of the deception and conspiracies, races off to raise an army of men. Scene 6 Vittoria and Zanche enter, followed by Flamineo. Flamineo interrupts Vittoria's prayers to demand payment for his service to Brachiano. Vittoria, outraged over his murder of Marcello, writes down that she will give him what God gave Cain. Angered, Flamineo storms out, and Zanche cautions Vittoria to be kinder to him. Flamineo rushes back in with a pair of pistols, and threatens Vittoria. She asks him to calm down, reminding him that she has no children and so he will inherit all that she owns. Flamineo explains to her that he swore an oath to Brachiano that neither he nor Vittoria would outlive him by longer than four hours, and that it is unlikely that any other authority will allow them to live. When Vittoria recognizes his resolve, she argues they should commit a dual suicide, and that Flamineo should go first. Zache adds that she will join them, but that Flamineo must show them how to properly kill themselves. Flamineo agrees, and instructs Zanche to shoot him and then Vittoria. The two women promise to follow the plan, and Flamineo gives them the guns. They then admit they have deceived him, and Vittoria ignores his insults to invoke the Furies, triumphant in her revenge. Zanche tells him that they will frame his murder like a suicide and thereby avoid any punishment for his death. Zanche shoots him. In the midst of a murmuring speech about hellish burning, Flamineo reveals that he has deceived them by not actually loading the guns with bullets. He curses both them and womankind in general before brandishing different weapons towards them. Lodovico, Gasparo, Carlo and Pedro suddenly barge in. They reveal their true identities, as well as that of the departed Mulinassar. Flamineo pleads with them to let him kill Vittoria, but they tie him to a pillar. Vittoria asks that Francisco kill her himself, but Gasparo explains nastily that great men recruit others to do their dirty work. Lodovico lashes out at Flamineo, explaining that he wishes he could kill him over and over again. When he says he will kill Zanche first, Vittoria begs him to kill her first. The women bravely confront their executioners, taunting that they will never cry. Simultaneously, the three men stab Flamineo, Vittoria, and Zanche. Vittoria and Flamineo taunt their executioners before reconciling with one another. Zanche dies, then Vittoria. As Flamineo finally dies, the English Ambassador bursts onto the stage, followed by Giovanni and the rest of the guards and ambassadors. The guards uses guns to capture the conspirators, and then announce their intention to incarcerate them in the dungeon. All exit.","Francisco, Lodovico, and Hortensio enter. Hortensio is listening in. Lodovico says that it's too dangerous for Francisco to stick around and risk his life--he's done enough already. Lodovico vows to finish the vengeance on his own . He exits. Francisco bids Lodovico farewell and says that he'll make sure he's famous and remembered if he dies during the attempt. Francisco exits. Hortensio overhears all this and says he senses something evil is afoot. He heads off to raise some guards from the citadel."],"next summary id":"act 5, scene 6","next chapter":"Vittoria enters holding a book, along with Zanche. Flamineo follows them.

Flamineo says these arguments don't move him--they're feminine and emotional. Zanche tells Vittoria to pretend to agree to die, but to convince Flamineo to kill himself first. She makes her case and it seems to work. Flamineo gives them the guns. He speculates on where he'll go in the afterlife, somewhat comically. They shoot, and run towards him, treading on his body. As Flamineo \"dies\" he asks them to kill themselves. They reveal that they faked him out. As Vittoria triumphantly believes she's sending him to hell, she makes scornful comments condemning him as he acts like he's smelling the soot and feeling the flames of hell as he dies. But Flamineo gets up and reveals that the pistols weren't really loaded with bullets. He was just testing Vittoria's loyalty. He now says he'll live to punish her for betraying him and warns men against wives who will betray them in the same kind of way, taking lovers as soon as they've died. Suddenly, Lodovico and Gasparo bust in, announcing that they're there to avenge Isabella. Flamineo finally recognizes who they really are. They admit that Mulinassar was really Francisco, visiting for vengeance. Flamineo laments that his fate has caught up with him. He claims it's better to just have good fortune than to gain wisdom. Vittoria pleads for mercy--but Gasparo says it's not going to happen. And Lodovico points out that he's getting back at Flamineo for the time he hit him. Flamineo refuses to beg to heaven out loud and when Lodovico asks him what's he's thinking about at the end, he says he's thinking of nothing. Vittoria tells them to kill her before Zanche. She speaks very defiantly, claiming she's unafraid to die. Zanche is defiant, too. Gasparo and Lodovico strike at once and kill all three. Vittoria cheekily says that, now, all Lodovico and Gasparo have to do to get famous is murder some innocent baby. As she dies Vittoria laments her family's sins, claiming that's why she was led astray. Flamineo says he loves his sister's bravery--she's not so bad, he says, since many women that seemed virtuous were really secretly vicious. Vittoria expresses confusion as to where her soul is headed, in death. Flamineo gives a speech, saying that death just frees us from dying and from being fortune's slaves. He refuses to look to heaven as he dies, looking only to himself. Yet he feels like he's \"in a mist.\" Vittoria dies after saying she regrets having ever met \"great men.\" Flamineo's speech continues: he warns people not to be too hopeful about life, especially if they serve great men. He admits that his life was a \"black charnel\" and says that it all seems utterly pointless and painful. He dies. Giovanni enters with the ambassadors. He asks Lodovico if he's responsible for these deaths. Lodovico admits it and says that he was acting under orders of Giovanni's own uncle, Francisco, who was the same Moor who had infiltrated the court . Giovanni orders Lodovico off to torture and execution. Lodovico says that he's extremely happy he was able to commit this act of revenge, and will find torture and the gallows as calm and soothing as sound sleep. Giovanni speaks the last line in the play, warning guilty men against committing evil, since evil deeds can quickly collapse and ruin the people who committed them."}

Finally, Prospero makes up his mind against revenge, and makes a speech that signifies his renunciation of magic; the accused and the other nobles enter the magic circle that Prospero has made, and stand there, enchanted, while he speaks. Prospero charges Alonso with throwing Prospero and his daughter out of Italy, and Antonio and Sebastian with being part of this crime. Prospero announces Ariel's freedom after Ariel sees the party back to Naples, and Ariel sings a song out of joy. Alonso and Prospero are reconciled after Alonso declares his remorse and repents his wrongs to Prospero and Miranda, and Prospero finally wins back his dukedom from Antonio. Prospero, perhaps unwillingly, also says that he forgives Antonio and Sebastian, though he calls them \\\"wicked\\\" and expresses his reservations about letting them off the hook. After despairing that his son is dead, Alonso finds out that his son Ferdinand is indeed alive, and the two are reunited; then, Ferdinand and Miranda's engagement is announced, and is approved before the whole party by Alonso and Prospero. Gonzalo rejoices that on the voyage, such a good match was made, and that the brothers are reunited, and some of the bad blood between them is now flushed out. Ariel has readied Alonso's boat for their departure, and the boatswain shows up again, telling them about what happened to all of the sailors during the tempest. Caliban apologizes to Prospero for taking the foolish Stephano as his master, and Prospero, at last, acknowledges Caliban, and takes him as his own. Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban's plot is exposed to the whole group, and is immediately forgiven. Prospero invites everyone to pass one last night in the island at his dwelling, and promises to tell the story of his and Miranda's survival, and of the devices of his magic. The play ends with Prospero addressing the audience, telling them that they hold an even greater power than Prospero the character, and can decide what happens next.\", \"analysis\": \"Prospero's first words suggest an alchemic metaphor; the words \\\"gather to a head\\\" denote things coming to a climax, but also liquid coming to a boil, and Prospero's \\\"project\\\" is a kind of scientific experiment as well. Prospero, with his somewhat sinister studies in magic and strange powers, is a figure reminiscent of an alchemist as well, though his experiments are more involved with human nature than metallurgy. Allusions to classical literature also appear in this act, but this time to Ovid rather than Virgil. Prospero's speech, starting at line 33, is very much reminiscent of one of Medea's speeches in the Metamorphoses: both speeches run roughly \\\"ye elvesby whose aid I have bedimmed, called forth,given fire, and rifted,\\\" and Shakespeare's language is too similar to Ovid's in its syntax, commanding and formal tone, and implications to be merely incidental. There are also a few interesting allusions to English folk beliefs in Prospero's speeches, one of them with the \\\"green sour ringlets\\\" that he mentions . These \\\"ringlets\\\" that he is referring to are fairy rings, or small circles of sour grass caused by the roots of toadstools; according to folk tales, these rings were made by fairies dancing. Suddenly appearing \\\"midnight mushrooms,\\\" as Prospero calls them, were thought to be another sign of fairies' overnight activities. The \\\"curfew\\\" that Prospero mentions in the same speech marked the beginning of the time of night when spirits were believed to walk abroad, and fairies and other creatures were believed to cause their mischief then. When Prospero at last confronts Alonso and his brothers, he uses another ocean metaphor to describe the gradual process of Prospero's spell falling from them, and their minds returning to reason. Understanding, in Prospero's estimation, is the sea, and confusion is the shore at low tide, waiting to be cleared of its \\\"foul and muddy\\\" covering. Though they are still charmed as Prospero speaks like this, gradually understanding will reach them, like the sea on an \\\"approaching tide\\\" . The surprise of Ferdinand alive on the island is nicely set up by one of Alonso's statements; upon being told that Prospero lost a daughter, in a manner of speaking, Alonso exclaims, \\\"o, that they were living both in Naples, the king and queen there!\\\" . The statement is perhaps too tidy a foreshadowing of the revelation that Ferdinand and Miranda are in fact alive, and will be united as king and queen; but, as in Act 1, an urgently expressed wish of one of the characters is fulfilled by the economical workings of the plot. Ferdinand and Miranda's pairing is a prime example of the political marriage, used frequently to cement unions between former enemies, as in this case; and they were also not uncommon in England, with Elizabeth's oft-proposed matches to French and Spanish royalty, and James I's strategic alliances forged with the marriages of his own children occurring in the era of this play. Ferdinand and Miranda metaphorically reduce their parents' political wrangling over \\\"kingdoms\\\" into a game of chess. Allegorically, the game of chess often represented political conflict over a prize, and here, the stakes are the realm that Miranda and Ferdinand will inherit. Although Ferdinand and Miranda are a confirmed couple by the end of the play, their discussion over the game foreshadows some political movement looming in their own future. Miranda makes an accusation, at least partly in jest, that Ferdinand will \\\"play false\\\"; the baseless charge recalls Prospero's false cry of treason against Ferdinand, in the first act . Yet, Miranda openly admits to complicity in any cheating that Ferdinand might commit: \\\"for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, and I would call it fair play,\\\" she assures him, her remark forecasting that the same ambition, deceit, and struggle that marked their parents' lives shall also be present in their own . As for Miranda, her famous exclamation of \\\"o brave new world that has such people in't\\\" can hardly be taken at its cheery face value, when Miranda's knowledge and the context around the statement are considered . The remark comes only ten lines after Miranda's half-joking, politically minded statements to Ferdinand; and, considering Miranda's typical tone and manner in the play, a wide-eyed expression of wonder would be out of character. The remark could have been spurred purely by the briefly worded reunion of Alonso and his son Ferdinand; however, coming so soon after Sebastian's less-than-exuberant remark, and with so little buildup, it is unlikely that Miranda's remark can be construed in a purely positive way. Also, Prospero's reply, \\\"'tis new to thee,\\\" sounds more like a remark correcting her assumption about the outside world, than a simple, rather unnecessary, and prosaic affirmation. The tone of Miranda's utterance is complicated by a great many factors, and its meaning is a great deal less straightforward than it suggests when taken out of context and character. As for the closure of this play, do not be misled by Gonzalo's typically optimistic appraisal of the situation. Gonzalo rejoices that \\\"Ferdinandfound a wife Prospero his dukedomand all of us ourselves,\\\" conveniently omitting any mention of Caliban's fate, or Sebastian and Antonio's lack of salvation . As with many of Shakespeare's comedies, with which this play is loosely grouped, the resolution is anything but cut and dry. There is a parallel lack of closure in Love's Labours Lost, in which the ladies of France swear at the end to leave off any discussion of marriage for an additional year; and in Twelfth Night, at the end of which Orsino and Viola's union is indefinitely postponed. Also, in Much Ado about Nothing, when Hero reveals herself to Claudio, he says no words of apology or love; a happy resolution can be read into the situation, but there is no reply at all from Claudio to such a major development, either in words or gestures in the stage directions. Shakespeare's comedies might be considered to have \\\"happy endings\\\"; but, the conclusions of these plays, even more so than with tragedies like Hamlet, are rarely simple in their implications, or harmonized in their meaning and tone. Prospero is finally aligned with Medea, a representation of dark magic, like Sycorax, in this act, further complicating his characterization. Prospero makes a rather strange claim in this act, that is brought up nowhere else in the play; he echoes Medea's claim in the Metamorphoses that he can call up dead men from their graves, which seems to be included merely to further identify Prospero with the figure of Medea. Sycorax, the witch whom Prospero takes every opportunity to disparage but whom he resembles in his use of force, manipulative use of his magic, and past history, is actually based upon Ovid's portrayal of Medea; and, the relation between Prospero and Sycorax\/Medea becomes more apparent in Prospero's speech, based upon the words of Medea. Medea and Sycorax represent a dark side of magic that is also present in Prospero; Prospero uses his magic for devious, selfish, and questionable purposes, and with him, it is difficult to separate the good-intentioned magic he uses from the bad. Prospero himself has a mixed view of his own magic; he recognizes how his fascination with magic lost him his dukedom, and almost caused his loss of control, and therefore cannot maintain his magical practices and his role as a man of action in the real world. He also chooses to give up his magic when he leaves the island, revealing a mixed view of magic in Prospero himself. Prospero's battle against his fabricated characterization of Sycorax is resolved when he finally accepts Caliban, her offspring, and the dark qualities that Caliban represents to him; \\\"this thing of darkness I \/ acknowledge mine,\\\" Prospero says, bringing closure to his struggles against Caliban and his allegedly evil mother . Prospero's relinquishing of his magic is coincident with the disclosure of his methods and devices; his magic is spoiled, just like any kind of magic, when the boatswain comes forth and tells of the strange fate of the ship, complete with some remarkably vivid sound imagery. Prospero's powers cannot survive the trial of being revealed, and his promise to tell Alonso of his devices and tricks is the final act of his resignation. As for Caliban, the wrongs done to him are not redressed, and the poetic, noble sentiments that he shows within the play, especially in his beautiful speech about the island, do not reappear. \\\"How fine my master is,\\\" Caliban exclaims; he fully proves himself a born servant, by apologizing to Prospero for taking the foolish, drunken Stephano for his master, and submitting himself to Prospero more willfully than ever . Trinculo and Stephano's ill-conceived murder plot is simply laughed off by the party, and Prospero shows no signs of treating Caliban with anything other than veiled contempt. Although Prospero does finally accept Caliban, he also still regards Caliban as being \\\"as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape\\\"; Prospero upholds his civilized superiority over this native, though to acknowledge Caliban and to also dislike his ways of being are completely contradictory views. A major theme running through the entire work is forgiveness versus vengeance; Prospero causes the tempest out of a wish for revenge, but by the end of the work, he decides to forgive the crimes against him, fabricated or otherwise. He finally declares this intent, with his words alluding to the proverb \\\"to be able to do harm and not do it is noble.\\\" The same sentiment is also offered up in Shakespeare's Sonnet 94: \\\"they that have power to hurt and will do noneRightly do inherit heaven's graces,\\\" that poem runs. At last, Prospero renounces the anger and resentment that marked his tone throughout the play, especially in scene 2 of the first act. Prospero declares his brothers \\\"penitent,\\\" though they are not; Alonso expresses his regret, but Antonio, who has the most to be sorry for, expresses no remorse. The circle of forgiveness remains unresolved by the end of the play, but, in a moment of irony, Prospero believes that closure has been reached. Throughout the play, Prospero does direct a disproportionate amount of blame toward Alonso, leading him to abduct and enslave Alonso's son Ferdinand; when confronting his brothers, Prospero actually calls Antonio \\\"a furtherer in the act,\\\" a great understatement of Antonio's actual role as prime perpetrator of the crime against Prospero. Alonso expresses complete penitence, asking Prospero to \\\"pardon me my wrongs\\\"; and he achieves some sort of reconciliation with Prospero, through his willingness to cooperate with Prospero's wishes of reconciliation. Also ironic is that the only crime that Prospero charges Antonio with is conspiring to kill Alonso, which Prospero himself arranged through Ariel; although Prospero focused his great anger on Antonio almost exclusively in Act 1, by the end of the play, he has, quite ironically, forgotten his primary motivation in causing the tempest and bringing his brothers and their companions to the island. As for Antonio and Sebastian, they are not satisfactorily redeemed by the end of the play, and Prospero's forgiveness, though openly and freely declared at first, is almost rescinded when he finally addresses the pair. His previously conciliatory tone turns threatening, as he says he could \\\"justify them traitors\\\" if he wished to do so . He even states that \\\"to call brother would even infect mouth,\\\" which is hardly an expression of forgiveness; but, in a strange paradox of sentiment, he completes his sentence with the words \\\"I do forgive thy rankest fault,\\\" turning an insult and a threat into some approximation of absolution . Also, Sebastian returns to his characteristic sarcasm, calling Ferdinand's survival \\\"a most high miracle\\\"; and his unimpressed tone is additional proof that not only is Sebastian not sorry for any wrongs, he is completely unchanged by the events of the play . In the end, the play's concern with political legitimacy is resolved by the disinheritance of the usurper, though it is unresolved in the case of Caliban. Prospero has again secured his dukedom, and also his daughter's power and marriage; and so, with Prospero's main goals achieved, the play ends. However, in an epilogue spoken by Prospero in rhymed couplets, Prospero steps outside the confines of the play to address the audience, as a character from within a fiction. The audience of the play, he says, are the ones who hold the power over his fate, and must finally forgive him for his deeds; a larger world surrounding the play is revealed, with the audience recreating the role of the author, which Prospero himself recreates, in turn, from within the play. No other Shakespeare play has quite this kind of un-ended ending to it; but, the sentiment is completely fitting, coming as it does after a play in which unfinished business is such a recurrent, pervasive theme.\"}","chapter":"ACT V. SCENE I.\n\n_Before the cell of Prospero._\n\n  _Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL._\n\n_Pros._ Now does my project gather to a head:\nMy charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time\nGoes upright with his carriage. How's the day?\n\n_Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\nYou said our work should cease.\n\n_Pros._                       I did say so,                          5\nWhen first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,\nHow fares the king and's followers?\n\n_Ari._                            Confined together\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\nIn the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;                    10\nThey cannot budge till your release. The king,\nHis brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\nHim that you term'd, sir, \"The good old lord, Gonzalo;\"             15\nHis tears run down his beard, like winter's drops\nFrom eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em,\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\nWould become tender.\n\n_Pros._            Dost thou think so, spirit?\n\n_Ari._ Mine would, sir, were I human.\n\n_Pros._                             And mine shall.                 20\nHast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\nOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,\nOne of their kind, that relish all as sharply,\nPassion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?\nThough with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,             25\nYet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury\nDo I take part: the rarer action is\nIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\nNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:                        30\nMy charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,\nAnd they shall be themselves.\n\n_Ari._                      I'll fetch them, sir.    [_Exit._\n\n_Pros._ Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;\nAnd ye that on the sands with printless foot\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him                         35\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\nWhereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\nIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid--                           40\nWeak masters though ye be--I have bedimm'd\nThe noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds.\nAnd 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault\nSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\nHave I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak                      45\nWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontory\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up\nThe pine and cedar: graves at my command\nHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic                           50\nI here abjure; and, when I have required\nSome heavenly music,--which even now I do,--\nTo work mine end upon their senses, that\nThis airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,                               55\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\nI'll drown my book.                    [_Solemn music._\n\n  _Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture,\n  attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,\n  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle\n  which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO\n  observing, speaks:_\n\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\nNow useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,                  60\nFor you are spell-stopp'd.\nHoly Gonzalo, honourable man,\nMine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,\nFall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night,                           65\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\nTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,\nMy true preserver, and a loyal sir\nTo him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces                        70\nHome both in word and deed. Most cruelly\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.\nThou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\nYou, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,                       75\nExpell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,--\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,--\nWould here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,\nUnnatural though thou art. Their understanding\nBegins to swell; and the approaching tide                           80\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shore,\nThat now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them\nThat yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,\nFetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:\nI will discase me, and myself present                               85\nAs I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;\nThou shalt ere long be free.\n\n_ARIEL sings and helps to attire him._\n\n    Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\n    In a cowslip's bell I lie;\n    There I couch when owls do cry.                                 90\n    On the bat's back I do fly\n    After summer merrily.\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.\n\n_Pros._ Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;             95\nBut yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.\nTo the king's ship, invisible as thou art:\nThere shalt thou find the mariners asleep\nUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswain\nBeing awake, enforce them to this place,                           100\nAnd presently, I prithee.\n\n_Ari._ I drink the air before me, and return\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.

When did you lose you daughter?\n\n_Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords\nAt this encounter do so much admire,\nThat they devour their reason, and scarce think                    155\nTheir eyes do offices of truth, their words\nAre natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have\nBeen justled from your senses, know for certain\nThat I am Prospero, and that very duke\nWhich was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely                160\nUpon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,\nTo be the Lord on't. No more yet of this;\nFor 'tis a chronicle of day by day,\nNot a relation for a breakfast, nor\nBefitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;                        165\nThis cell's my court: here have I few attendants,\nAnd subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.\nMy dukedom since you have given me again,\nI will requite you with as good a thing;\nAt least bring forth a wonder, to content ye                       170\nAs much as me my dukedom.\n\n  _Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess._\n\n_Mir._ Sweet lord, you play me false.\n\n_Fer._                              No, my dear'st love,\nI would not for the world.\n\n_Mir._ Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\nAnd I would call it fair play.\n\n_Alon._                      If this prove                         175\nA vision of the island, one dear son\nShall I twice lose.\n\n_Seb._            A most high miracle!\n\n_Fer._ Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;\nI have cursed them without cause.

She\nIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\nOf whom so often I have heard renown,\nBut never saw before; of whom I have\nReceived a second life; and second father                          195\nThis lady makes him to me.\n\n_Alon._                  I am hers:\nBut, O, how oddly will it sound that I\nMust ask my child forgiveness!\n\n_Pros._                      There, sir, stop:\nLet us not burthen our remembrances with\nA heaviness that's gone.\n\n_Gon._                 I have inly wept,                           200\nOr should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,\nAnd on this couple drop a blessed crown!\nFor it is you that have chalk'd forth the way\nWhich brought us hither.\n\n_Alon._                I say, Amen, Gonzalo!\n\n_Gon._ Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue                 205\nShould become kings of Naples? O, rejoice\nBeyond a common joy! and set it down\nWith gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage\nDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\nAnd Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife                           210\nWhere he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom\nIn a poor isle, and all of us ourselves\nWhen no man was his own.\n\n_Alon._ [_to Fer. and Mir._] Give me your hands:\nLet grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\nThat doth not wish you joy!\n\n_Gon._                    Be it so! Amen!                          215\n\n  _Re-enter ARIEL, with the _Master_ and _Boatswain_ amazedly\n  following._\n\nO, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:\nI prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\nThis fellow could not drown.

Similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes\nits nominative. For example, _Tempest_, IV. 1. 262, 'Lies at my mercy\nall mine enemies,' and _Measure for Measure_, II. 1. 22, 'What knows the\nlaws, &c.' We correct it in those passages where the occurrence of a\nvulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. In the mouth of a\nBoatswain it can offend no one. We therefore leave it.\n\n\nNOTE II.\n\nI. 1. 57-59. _Mercy on us!--we split, &c._ It may be doubtful whether\nthe printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches to express\n'a confused noise within.' Without question such was the author's\nmeaning. Rowe, however, and subsequent editors, printed them as part of\nGonzalo's speech. Capell was the first editor who gave the true\narrangement.\n\n\nNOTE III.\n\nI. 2. 173. _princesses._ See Mr Sidney Walker's _Shakespeare's\nVersification_, p. 243 sqq. 'The plurals of substantives ending in _s_,\nin certain instances, in _se_, _ss_, _ce_, and sometimes _ge_, ... are\nfound without the usual addition of _s_ or _es_, in pronunciation at\nleast, although in many instances the plural affix is added in printing,\nwhere the metre shows that it is not to be pronounced.'\n\nIn this and other instances, we have thought it better to trust to the\near of the reader for the rhythm than to introduce an innovation in\northography which might perplex him as to the sense. The form\n'princesses,' the use of which in Shakespeare's time was doubted by one\nof our correspondents, is found in the _History of King Leir_.\n\nRowe's reading 'princes' might be defended on the ground that the\nsentiment is general, and applicable to royal children of both sexes; or\nthat Sir Philip Sidney, in the first book of the _Arcadia_, calls Pamela\nand Philoclea 'princes.'\n\n\nNOTE IV.\n\nI. 2. 298. The metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is\ndefective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely\nsatisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as\nthey are printed in the Folio. The defect, indeed, in the metre of line\n298 has not been noticed except by Hanmer, who makes a line thus:\n\n  'Do so, and after two days I'll discharge thee.'\n\nPossibly it ought to be printed thus:\n\n              'Do so; and\n  After two days\n  I will discharge thee.'\n\nThere is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene,\nanother of seven, 235.\n\nThere is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as Shakespeare wrote\nthem, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four\nhours (I. 2. 240 and V. 1. 186), yet Ariel's ministry is not to end till\nthe voyage to Naples shall be over. Prospero, too, repeats his promise,\nand marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude,\n'within two days,' I. 2. 420. Possibly 'Invisible' (301) should have a\nline to itself. Words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked\nemphasis.\n\nBut the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare's language passes so\nrapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even\nhovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than\nmetrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made\nwith diffidence and received with doubt.\n\n\nNOTE V.\n\nI. 2. 377, 378:\n\n  _Courtsied when you have and kiss'd_\n  _The wild waves whist._\n\nThis punctuation seems to be supported by what Ferdinand says (391,\n392):\n\n  'The music crept by me upon the waters,\n  Allaying both their fury and my passion, &c.'\n\nAt the end of the stanza we have printed _Hark, hark! ... The watch-dogs\nbark_ as that part of the burthen which 'sweet sprites bear.' The other\npart is borne by distant watch-dogs.\n\n\nNOTE VI.\n\nI. 2. 443. _I fear you have done yourself some wrong._ See this phrase\nused in a similar sense, _Measure for Measure_, I. 11. 39.\n\n\nNOTE VII.\n\nII. 1. 27. _Which, of he or Adrian._ 'Of' is found in the same\nconstruction, _Midsummer Night's Dream_, III. 2. 336,\n\n  'Now follow if thou darest to try whose right,\n  Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.'\n\n\nNOTE VIII.\n\nII. 1. 157. _Of its own kind._ There is no doubt, as Dr Guest has shewn,\nthat 'it,' which is the reading of the 1st and 2nd folios, was commonly\nused as a genitive in Shakespeare's time, as it is still in some\nprovincial dialects. 'Its,' however, was coming into use. One instance\noccurs in this play, I. 11. 95, 'in its contrary.'\n\n\nNOTE IX.\n\nII. 1. 241. _she that from whom._ Mr Spedding writes: 'The received\nemendation is not satisfactory to me. I would rather read, \"She\nthat--From whom? All were sea-swallow'd &c., i.e. from whom should she\nhave note? The report from Naples will be that all were drowned. We\nshall be the only survivors.\" The break in the construction seems to me\ncharacteristic of the speaker. But you must read the whole speech to\nfeel the effect.'\n\n\nNOTE X.\n\nII. 1. 249-251. All editors except Mr Staunton have printed in italics\n(or between inverted commas) only as far as '_Naples?_', but as '_keep_'\nis printed with a small k in the folios, they seem to sanction the\narrangement given in our text.\n\n\nNOTE XI.\n\nII. 1. 267. _Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe._ Mr Singer and\nMr Dyce have changed ''twere' to 'it were' for the sake of the metre.\nBut then the first part of the line must be read with a wrong emphasis.\nThe proper emphasis clearly falls on the first, third, and fifth\nsyllables, 'AY, sir; WHERE lies THAT?' See Preface.\n\n\nNOTE XII.\n\nII. 2. 165. Before 'here; bear my bottle' Capell inserts a stage\ndirection [_To Cal._], but it appears from III. 2. 62, that Trinculo was\nentrusted with the office of bottle-bearer.\n\n\nNOTE XIII.\n\nIII. 1. 15. _Most busy lest, when I do it._ As none of the proposed\nemendations can be regarded as certain, we have left the reading of F1,\nthough it is manifestly corrupt. The spelling 'doe' makes Mr Spedding's\nconjecture 'idlest' for 'I doe it' more probable.\n\n\nNOTE XIV.\n\nIII. 3. 17. The stage direction, which we have divided into two parts,\nis placed all at once in the folios after 'as when they are fresh'\n[Solemne and strange Musicke; and Prosper on the top (invisible:) Enter\n... depart].\n\nPope transferred it to follow Sebastian's words, 'I say, to night: no\nmore.'\n\n\nNOTE XV.\n\nIII. 3. 48. _Each putter out of five for one._ See Beaumont and\nFletcher, _The Noble Gentleman_, I. 1. (Vol. II. p. 261, ed. Moxon):\n'The return will give you five for one.'

Finally, Prospero makes up his mind against revenge, and makes a speech that signifies his renunciation of magic; the accused and the other nobles enter the magic circle that Prospero has made, and stand there, enchanted, while he speaks. Prospero charges Alonso with throwing Prospero and his daughter out of Italy, and Antonio and Sebastian with being part of this crime. Prospero announces Ariel's freedom after Ariel sees the party back to Naples, and Ariel sings a song out of joy. Alonso and Prospero are reconciled after Alonso declares his remorse and repents his wrongs to Prospero and Miranda, and Prospero finally wins back his dukedom from Antonio. Prospero, perhaps unwillingly, also says that he forgives Antonio and Sebastian, though he calls them \"wicked\" and expresses his reservations about letting them off the hook. After despairing that his son is dead, Alonso finds out that his son Ferdinand is indeed alive, and the two are reunited; then, Ferdinand and Miranda's engagement is announced, and is approved before the whole party by Alonso and Prospero. Gonzalo rejoices that on the voyage, such a good match was made, and that the brothers are reunited, and some of the bad blood between them is now flushed out. Ariel has readied Alonso's boat for their departure, and the boatswain shows up again, telling them about what happened to all of the sailors during the tempest. Caliban apologizes to Prospero for taking the foolish Stephano as his master, and Prospero, at last, acknowledges Caliban, and takes him as his own. Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban's plot is exposed to the whole group, and is immediately forgiven. Prospero invites everyone to pass one last night in the island at his dwelling, and promises to tell the story of his and Miranda's survival, and of the devices of his magic. The play ends with Prospero addressing the audience, telling them that they hold an even greater power than Prospero the character, and can decide what happens next.","summary_analysis":"Prospero's first words suggest an alchemic metaphor; the words \"gather to a head\" denote things coming to a climax, but also liquid coming to a boil, and Prospero's \"project\" is a kind of scientific experiment as well. Prospero, with his somewhat sinister studies in magic and strange powers, is a figure reminiscent of an alchemist as well, though his experiments are more involved with human nature than metallurgy. Allusions to classical literature also appear in this act, but this time to Ovid rather than Virgil. Prospero's speech, starting at line 33, is very much reminiscent of one of Medea's speeches in the Metamorphoses: both speeches run roughly \"ye elvesby whose aid I have bedimmed, called forth,given fire, and rifted,\" and Shakespeare's language is too similar to Ovid's in its syntax, commanding and formal tone, and implications to be merely incidental. There are also a few interesting allusions to English folk beliefs in Prospero's speeches, one of them with the \"green sour ringlets\" that he mentions . These \"ringlets\" that he is referring to are fairy rings, or small circles of sour grass caused by the roots of toadstools; according to folk tales, these rings were made by fairies dancing. Suddenly appearing \"midnight mushrooms,\" as Prospero calls them, were thought to be another sign of fairies' overnight activities. The \"curfew\" that Prospero mentions in the same speech marked the beginning of the time of night when spirits were believed to walk abroad, and fairies and other creatures were believed to cause their mischief then. When Prospero at last confronts Alonso and his brothers, he uses another ocean metaphor to describe the gradual process of Prospero's spell falling from them, and their minds returning to reason. Understanding, in Prospero's estimation, is the sea, and confusion is the shore at low tide, waiting to be cleared of its \"foul and muddy\" covering. Though they are still charmed as Prospero speaks like this, gradually understanding will reach them, like the sea on an \"approaching tide\" . The surprise of Ferdinand alive on the island is nicely set up by one of Alonso's statements; upon being told that Prospero lost a daughter, in a manner of speaking, Alonso exclaims, \"o, that they were living both in Naples, the king and queen there!\" . The statement is perhaps too tidy a foreshadowing of the revelation that Ferdinand and Miranda are in fact alive, and will be united as king and queen; but, as in Act 1, an urgently expressed wish of one of the characters is fulfilled by the economical workings of the plot. Ferdinand and Miranda's pairing is a prime example of the political marriage, used frequently to cement unions between former enemies, as in this case; and they were also not uncommon in England, with Elizabeth's oft-proposed matches to French and Spanish royalty, and James I's strategic alliances forged with the marriages of his own children occurring in the era of this play. Ferdinand and Miranda metaphorically reduce their parents' political wrangling over \"kingdoms\" into a game of chess. Allegorically, the game of chess often represented political conflict over a prize, and here, the stakes are the realm that Miranda and Ferdinand will inherit. Although Ferdinand and Miranda are a confirmed couple by the end of the play, their discussion over the game foreshadows some political movement looming in their own future. Miranda makes an accusation, at least partly in jest, that Ferdinand will \"play false\"; the baseless charge recalls Prospero's false cry of treason against Ferdinand, in the first act . Yet, Miranda openly admits to complicity in any cheating that Ferdinand might commit: \"for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, and I would call it fair play,\" she assures him, her remark forecasting that the same ambition, deceit, and struggle that marked their parents' lives shall also be present in their own . As for Miranda, her famous exclamation of \"o brave new world that has such people in't\" can hardly be taken at its cheery face value, when Miranda's knowledge and the context around the statement are considered . The remark comes only ten lines after Miranda's half-joking, politically minded statements to Ferdinand; and, considering Miranda's typical tone and manner in the play, a wide-eyed expression of wonder would be out of character. The remark could have been spurred purely by the briefly worded reunion of Alonso and his son Ferdinand; however, coming so soon after Sebastian's less-than-exuberant remark, and with so little buildup, it is unlikely that Miranda's remark can be construed in a purely positive way. Also, Prospero's reply, \"'tis new to thee,\" sounds more like a remark correcting her assumption about the outside world, than a simple, rather unnecessary, and prosaic affirmation. The tone of Miranda's utterance is complicated by a great many factors, and its meaning is a great deal less straightforward than it suggests when taken out of context and character. As for the closure of this play, do not be misled by Gonzalo's typically optimistic appraisal of the situation. Gonzalo rejoices that \"Ferdinandfound a wife Prospero his dukedomand all of us ourselves,\" conveniently omitting any mention of Caliban's fate, or Sebastian and Antonio's lack of salvation . As with many of Shakespeare's comedies, with which this play is loosely grouped, the resolution is anything but cut and dry. There is a parallel lack of closure in Love's Labours Lost, in which the ladies of France swear at the end to leave off any discussion of marriage for an additional year; and in Twelfth Night, at the end of which Orsino and Viola's union is indefinitely postponed. Also, in Much Ado about Nothing, when Hero reveals herself to Claudio, he says no words of apology or love; a happy resolution can be read into the situation, but there is no reply at all from Claudio to such a major development, either in words or gestures in the stage directions. Shakespeare's comedies might be considered to have \"happy endings\"; but, the conclusions of these plays, even more so than with tragedies like Hamlet, are rarely simple in their implications, or harmonized in their meaning and tone. Prospero is finally aligned with Medea, a representation of dark magic, like Sycorax, in this act, further complicating his characterization. Prospero makes a rather strange claim in this act, that is brought up nowhere else in the play; he echoes Medea's claim in the Metamorphoses that he can call up dead men from their graves, which seems to be included merely to further identify Prospero with the figure of Medea. Sycorax, the witch whom Prospero takes every opportunity to disparage but whom he resembles in his use of force, manipulative use of his magic, and past history, is actually based upon Ovid's portrayal of Medea; and, the relation between Prospero and Sycorax\/Medea becomes more apparent in Prospero's speech, based upon the words of Medea. Medea and Sycorax represent a dark side of magic that is also present in Prospero; Prospero uses his magic for devious, selfish, and questionable purposes, and with him, it is difficult to separate the good-intentioned magic he uses from the bad. Prospero himself has a mixed view of his own magic; he recognizes how his fascination with magic lost him his dukedom, and almost caused his loss of control, and therefore cannot maintain his magical practices and his role as a man of action in the real world. He also chooses to give up his magic when he leaves the island, revealing a mixed view of magic in Prospero himself. Prospero's battle against his fabricated characterization of Sycorax is resolved when he finally accepts Caliban, her offspring, and the dark qualities that Caliban represents to him; \"this thing of darkness I \/ acknowledge mine,\" Prospero says, bringing closure to his struggles against Caliban and his allegedly evil mother . Prospero's relinquishing of his magic is coincident with the disclosure of his methods and devices; his magic is spoiled, just like any kind of magic, when the boatswain comes forth and tells of the strange fate of the ship, complete with some remarkably vivid sound imagery. Prospero's powers cannot survive the trial of being revealed, and his promise to tell Alonso of his devices and tricks is the final act of his resignation. As for Caliban, the wrongs done to him are not redressed, and the poetic, noble sentiments that he shows within the play, especially in his beautiful speech about the island, do not reappear. \"How fine my master is,\" Caliban exclaims; he fully proves himself a born servant, by apologizing to Prospero for taking the foolish, drunken Stephano for his master, and submitting himself to Prospero more willfully than ever . Trinculo and Stephano's ill-conceived murder plot is simply laughed off by the party, and Prospero shows no signs of treating Caliban with anything other than veiled contempt. Although Prospero does finally accept Caliban, he also still regards Caliban as being \"as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape\"; Prospero upholds his civilized superiority over this native, though to acknowledge Caliban and to also dislike his ways of being are completely contradictory views. A major theme running through the entire work is forgiveness versus vengeance; Prospero causes the tempest out of a wish for revenge, but by the end of the work, he decides to forgive the crimes against him, fabricated or otherwise. He finally declares this intent, with his words alluding to the proverb \"to be able to do harm and not do it is noble.\" The same sentiment is also offered up in Shakespeare's Sonnet 94: \"they that have power to hurt and will do noneRightly do inherit heaven's graces,\" that poem runs. At last, Prospero renounces the anger and resentment that marked his tone throughout the play, especially in scene 2 of the first act. Prospero declares his brothers \"penitent,\" though they are not; Alonso expresses his regret, but Antonio, who has the most to be sorry for, expresses no remorse. The circle of forgiveness remains unresolved by the end of the play, but, in a moment of irony, Prospero believes that closure has been reached. Throughout the play, Prospero does direct a disproportionate amount of blame toward Alonso, leading him to abduct and enslave Alonso's son Ferdinand; when confronting his brothers, Prospero actually calls Antonio \"a furtherer in the act,\" a great understatement of Antonio's actual role as prime perpetrator of the crime against Prospero. Alonso expresses complete penitence, asking Prospero to \"pardon me my wrongs\"; and he achieves some sort of reconciliation with Prospero, through his willingness to cooperate with Prospero's wishes of reconciliation. Also ironic is that the only crime that Prospero charges Antonio with is conspiring to kill Alonso, which Prospero himself arranged through Ariel; although Prospero focused his great anger on Antonio almost exclusively in Act 1, by the end of the play, he has, quite ironically, forgotten his primary motivation in causing the tempest and bringing his brothers and their companions to the island. As for Antonio and Sebastian, they are not satisfactorily redeemed by the end of the play, and Prospero's forgiveness, though openly and freely declared at first, is almost rescinded when he finally addresses the pair. His previously conciliatory tone turns threatening, as he says he could \"justify them traitors\" if he wished to do so . He even states that \"to call brother would even infect mouth,\" which is hardly an expression of forgiveness; but, in a strange paradox of sentiment, he completes his sentence with the words \"I do forgive thy rankest fault,\" turning an insult and a threat into some approximation of absolution . Also, Sebastian returns to his characteristic sarcasm, calling Ferdinand's survival \"a most high miracle\"; and his unimpressed tone is additional proof that not only is Sebastian not sorry for any wrongs, he is completely unchanged by the events of the play . In the end, the play's concern with political legitimacy is resolved by the disinheritance of the usurper, though it is unresolved in the case of Caliban. Prospero has again secured his dukedom, and also his daughter's power and marriage; and so, with Prospero's main goals achieved, the play ends. However, in an epilogue spoken by Prospero in rhymed couplets, Prospero steps outside the confines of the play to address the audience, as a character from within a fiction. The audience of the play, he says, are the ones who hold the power over his fate, and must finally forgive him for his deeds; a larger world surrounding the play is revealed, with the audience recreating the role of the author, which Prospero himself recreates, in turn, from within the play. No other Shakespeare play has quite this kind of un-ended ending to it; but, the sentiment is completely fitting, coming as it does after a play in which unfinished business is such a recurrent, pervasive theme.","summary_length":351.0,"analysis_length":2143.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["act iv"],"previous chapter":["Prospero stops Ferdinand's punishment, and decides to finally give Miranda to him, since he has proven his love for her through his service. Prospero accepts the union, but issues them a warning; if Ferdinand takes Miranda's virginity before a ceremony can be performed, then their union will be cursed. Ferdinand swears to Prospero that they shall wait until the ceremony to consummate their marriage, and then Prospero calls upon Ariel to perform one of his last acts of magic. A betrothal masque is performed for the party by some of Prospero's magical spirits; Juno, Ceres, and Iris are the goddesses who are represented within the masque, and the play speaks about the bounties of a good marriage, and blesses the happy couple. This act of magic so captivates Prospero that he forgets Caliban's plot to kill him; for a moment, he almost loses control, but manages to pull himself out of his reverie and take action. Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo come looking for Prospero, and swipe a few garments of Prospero's on their way. Caliban still wants very much to kill Prospero, and carry out this plot; however, Trinculo and Stephano are very drunk, as usual, and prove completely incapable of anything but petty theft. Prospero catches themnot difficult, since they are making a huge amount of noise--and sends Ariel after them as they flee."],"next summary id":"act v","next chapter":"Prospero finally has all under his control; Ariel has apprehended Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio, and they are all waiting for Prospero's judgment.

He wants to plead that now is the time, not later as some believe. It is the unity of the colonists and not their numbers that is their great strength. They have the largest body of disciplined civilian forces of any country. The colonies singly cannot survive but all together they are strong. The land army is sufficient, but Paine makes a plea for building a navy. The colonies are not in debt; they only need to leave posterity a settled form of government. They have already spent millions to get the stamp acts repealed. The momentum should be used for a greater purpose, to gain independence. He gives a list of costs for building a navy, saying what a valuable asset it is, and how America is situated to have a great navy. They have the timber and knowledge of shipbuilding. They are no longer a little people but moving toward greatness. He speaks of Britain's mighty navy but predicts an American navy could beat it. Paine lists the rich stores of saltpeter, gunpowder, and small arms the country has. Americans have a character of courage, so why hesitate?America is not in an infant state as some believe. It is at the proper size for venturing to war without much to lose, and with much to gain. It is a young nation in formation, and this time will never come again. He believes that the government should protect religious diversity. They have to go to war, for there is no one who can mediate this quarrel. He does not expect support from France or Spain, but the Americans should publish a manifesto to foreign powers explaining their grieves and reasons for leaving Britain. On the other hand, as British subjects, they have no right to approach other governments to negotiate. The sooner Americans undertake this venture, the better it will be, rather than put it off until it becomes more difficult.\", \"analysis\": \"Commentary On the Present Ability of America, With Some Miscellaneous Reflections In this section Paine tries to make it seem that everyone agrees on independence, but they just want to put it off. He moves past trying to convince readers of the justice of the cause and instead, explains why Americans are ready for war and will be successful. His vision of an American navy is powerful and compelling, showing that the country is far beyond being a colony. It is already mature and should be on its own. It needs to be able to negotiate with other countries as a separate and sovereign power. Paine makes a point of the readiness of the colonials. The colonial people were very well prepared to break away from Britain and rule themselves. Every village had a town hall used to debating local issues. It had a standing civilian militia that drilled and stood ready to march. The colonies had a network set up, a Committee of Correspondence, a resistance force with newspapers, pamphlets , to disperse the ideas that would propel the colonists to fight for their rights. Paine was an important part of this propaganda machine. The Committee circulated the news of British atrocities against the colonials, such as forcing the colonies to buy British products at high prices and with a tax, such as the taxed tea that the colonials threw into the Boston Harbor . The British put tariffs on non-British products. The colonials wanted to conduct their own trade. Most of them were property owners fighting for their own land.\"}","chapter":"I HAVE never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath\nnot confessed his opinion, that a separation between the countries,\nwould take place one time or other: And there is no instance, in\nwhich we have shewn less judgment, than in endeavouring to describe,\nwhat we call, the ripeness or fitness of the Continent for\nindependance.\n\nAs all men allow the measure, and vary only in their opinion of the\ntime, let us, in order to remove mistakes, take a general survey of\nthings, and endeavour, if possible, to find out the VERY time. But\nwe need not go far, the inquiry ceases at once, for, the TIME HATH\nFOUND US. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things\nprove the fact.\n\nIt is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies;\nyet our present numbers are sufficient to repel the force of all the\nworld. The Continent hath, at this time, the largest body of armed\nand disciplined men of any power under Heaven; and is just arrived at\nthat pitch of strength, in which, no single colony is able to support\nitself, and the whole, when united, can accomplish the matter, and\neither more, or, less than this, might be fatal in its effects. Our\nland force is already sufficient, and as to naval affairs, we cannot\nbe insensible, that Britain would never suffer an American man of war\nto be built, while the continent remained in her hands. Wherefore, we\nshould be no forwarder an hundred years hence in that branch, than we\nare now; but the truth is, we should be less so, because the timber\nof the country is every day diminishing, and that, which will remain\nat last, will be far off and difficult to procure.\n\nWere the continent crowded with inhabitants, her sufferings under\nthe present circumstances would be intolerable. The more sea port\ntowns we had, the more should we have both to defend and to loose.\nOur present numbers are so happily proportioned to our wants, that no\nman need be idle. The diminution of trade affords an army, and the\nnecessities of an army create a new trade.\n\nDebts we have none; and whatever we may contract on this account\nwill serve as a glorious memento of our virtue. Can we but leave\nposterity with a settled form of government, an independant\nconstitution of it's own, the purchase at any price will be cheap.\nBut to expend millions for the sake of getting a few vile acts\nrepealed, and routing the present ministry only, is unworthy the\ncharge, and is using posterity with the utmost cruelty; because it is\nleaving them the great work to do, and a debt upon their backs, from\nwhich, they derive no advantage. Such a thought is unworthy a man of\nhonor, and is the true characteristic of a narrow heart and a pedling\npolitician.\n\nThe debt we may contract doth not deserve our regard if the work be\nbut accomplished. No nation ought to be without a debt. A national\ndebt is a national bond; and when it bears no interest, is in no case\na grievance. Britain is oppressed with a debt of upwards of one\nhundred and forty millions sterling, for which she pays upwards of\nfour millions interest. And as a compensation for her debt, she has a\nlarge navy; America is without a debt, and without a navy; yet for\nthe twentieth part of the English national debt, could have a navy as\nlarge again.

Tar, timber, iron, and cordage\nare her natural produce. We need go abroad for nothing. Whereas the\nDutch, who make large profits by hiring out their ships of war to the\nSpaniards and Portuguese, are obliged to import most of the materials\nthey use. We ought to view the building a fleet as an article of\ncommerce, it being the natural manufactory of this country. It is the\nbest money we can lay out. A navy when finished is worth more than it\ncost. And is that nice point in national policy, in which commerce\nand protection are united. Let us build; if we want them not, we can\nsell; and by that means replace our paper currency with ready gold\nand silver.\n\nIn point of manning a fleet, people in general run into great\nerrors; it is not necessary that one fourth part should be sailor.\nThe Terrible privateer, Captain Death, stood the hottest engagement\nof any ship last war, yet had not twenty sailors on board, though her\ncomplement of men was upwards of two hundred. A few able and social\nsailors will soon instruct a sufficient number of active landmen in\nthe common work of a ship. Wherefore, we never can be more capable to\nbegin on maritime matters than now, while our timber is standing, our\nfisheries blocked up, and our sailors and shipwrights out of employ.\nMen of war, of seventy and eighty guns were built forty years ago in\nNew England, and why not the same now? Ship-building is America's\ngreatest pride, and in which, she will in time excel the whole world.\nThe great empires of the east are mostly inland, and consequently\nexcluded from the possibility of rivalling her. Africa is in a state\nof barbarism; and no power in Europe, hath either such an extent of\ncoast, or such an internal supply of materials. Where nature hath\ngiven the one, she has withheld the other; to America only hath she\nbeen liberal of both. The vast empire of Russia is almost shut out\nfrom the sea; wherefore, her boundless forests, her tar, iron, and\ncordage are only articles of commerce.\n\nIn point of safety, ought we to be without a fleet? We are not the\nlittle people now, which we were sixty years ago; at that time we\nmight have trusted our property in the streets, or fields rather; and\nslept securely without locks or bolts to our doors or windows. The\ncase now is altered, and our methods of defence, ought to improve\nwith our increase of property. A common pirate, twelve months ago,\nmight have come up the Delaware, and laid the city of Philadelphia\nunder instant contribution, for what sum he pleased; and the same\nmight have happened to other places. Nay, any daring fellow, in a\nbrig of fourteen or sixteen guns, might have robbed the whole\nContinent, and carried off half a million of money. These are\ncircumstances which demand our attention, and point out the necessity\nof naval protection.\n\nSome, perhaps, will say, that after we have made it up with\nBritain, she will protect us. Can we be so unwise as to mean, that\nshe shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose? Common sense\nwill tell us, that the power which hath endeavoured to subdue us, is\nof all others, the most improper to defend us. Conquest may be\neffected under the pretence of friendship; and ourselves, after a\nlong and brave resistance, be at last cheated into slavery. And if\nher ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how\nis she to protect us? A navy three or four thousand miles off can be\nof little use, and on sudden emergencies, none at all. Wherefore, if\nwe must hereafter protect ourselves, why not do it for ourselves? Why\ndo it for another?\n\nThe English list of ships of war, is long and formidable, but not a\ntenth part of them are at any time fit for service, numbers of them\nnot in being; yet their names are pompously continued in the list, if\nonly a plank be left of the ship: and not a fifth part, of such as\nare fit for service, can be spared on any one station at one time.\nThe East, and West Indies, Mediterranean, Africa, and other parts\nover which Britain extends her claim, make large demands upon her\nnavy. From a mixture of prejudice and inattention, we have contracted\na false notion respecting the navy of England, and have talked as if\nwe should have the whole of it to encounter at once, and for that\nreason, supposed, that we must have one as large; which not being\ninstantly practicable, have been made use of by a set of disguised\nTories to discourage our beginning thereon. Nothing can be farther\nfrom truth than this; for if America had only a twentieth part of the\nnaval force of Britain, she would be by far an over match for her;\nbecause, as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our\nwhole force would be employed on our own coast, where we should, in\nthe long run, have two to one the advantage of those who had three or\nfour thousand miles to sail over, before they could attack us, and\nthe same distance to return in order to refit and recruit. And\nalthough Britain by her fleet, hath a check over our trade to Europe,\nwe have as large a one over her trade to the West Indies, which, by\nlaying in the neighbourhood of the Continent, is entirely at its\nmercy.\n\nSome method might be fallen on to keep up a naval force in time of\npeace, if we should not judge it necessary to support a constant\nnavy. If premiums were to be given to merchants, to build and employ\nin their service, ships mounted with twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty\nguns, (the premiums to be in proportion to the loss of bulk to the\nmerchants) fifty or sixty of those ships, with a few guard ships on\nconstant duty, would keep up a sufficient navy, and that without\nburdening ourselves with the evil so loudly complained of in England,\nof suffering their fleet, in time of peace to lie rotting in the\ndocks. To unite the sinews of commerce and defence is sound policy;\nfor when our strength and our riches, play into each other's hand, we\nneed fear no external enemy.\n\nIn almost every article of defence we abound. Hemp flourishes even\nto rankness, so that we need not want cordage. Our iron is superior\nto that of other countries. Our small arms equal to any in the world.\nCannons we can cast at pleasure. Saltpetre and gunpowder we are every\nday producing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Resolution is our\ninherent character, and courage hath never yet forsaken us.\nWherefore, what is it that we want? Why is it that we hesitate? From\nBritain we can expect nothing but ruin. If she is once admitted to\nthe government of America again, this Continent will not be worth\nliving in. Jealousies will be always arising; insurrections will be\nconstantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them? Who will\nventure his life to reduce his own countrymen to a foreign obedience?\nThe difference between Pennsylvania and Connecticut, respecting some\nunlocated lands, shews the insignificance of a British government,\nand fully proves, that nothing but Continental authority can regulate\nContinental matters.\n\nAnother reason why the present time is preferable to all others,\nis, that the fewer our numbers are, the more land there is yet\nunoccupied, which instead of being lavished by the king on his\nworthless dependents, may be hereafter applied, not only to the\ndischarge of the present debt, but to the constant support of\ngovernment. No nation under heaven hath such an advantage as this.\n\nThe infant state of the Colonies, as it is called, so far from\nbeing against, is an argument in favor of independance. We are\nsufficiently numerous, and were we more so, we might be less united.\nIt is a matter worthy of observation, that the more a country is\npeopled, the smaller their armies are. In military numbers, the\nancients far exceeded the moderns: and the reason is evident, for\ntrade being the consequence of population, men become too much\nabsorbed thereby to attend to any thing else. Commerce diminishes the\nspirit, both of patriotism and military defence. And history\nsufficiently informs us, that the bravest achievements were always\naccomplished in the non age of a nation. With the increase of\ncommerce, England hath lost its spirit. The city of London,\nnotwithstanding its numbers, submits to continued insults with the\npatience of a coward. The more men have to lose, the less willing are\nthey to venture. The rich are in general slaves to fear, and submit\nto courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a Spaniel.\n\nYouth is the seed time of good habits, as well in nations as in\nindividuals. It might be difficult, if not impossible, to form the\nContinent into one government half a century hence. The vast variety\nof interests, occasioned by an increase of trade and population,\nwould create confusion. Colony would be against colony. Each being\nable might scorn each other's assistance; and while the proud and\nfoolish gloried in their little distinctions, the wise would lament,\nthat the union had not been formed before. Wherefore, the PRESENT\nTIME is the TRUE TIME for establishing it. The intimacy which is\ncontracted in infancy, and the friendship which is formed in\nmisfortune, are, of all others, the most lasting and unalterable. Our\npresent union is marked with both these characters: we are young, and\nwe have been distressed; but our concord hath withstood our troubles,\nand fixes a memorable area for posterity to glory in.\n\nThe present time, likewise, is that peculiar time, which never\nhappens to a nation but once, VIZ. the time of forming itself into\na government. Most nations have let slip the opportunity, and by that\nmeans have been compelled to receive laws from their conquerors,\ninstead of making laws for themselves. First, they had a king, and\nthen a form of government; whereas, the articles or charter of\ngovernment, should be formed first, and men delegated to execute them\nafterwards: but from the errors of other nations, let us learn\nwisdom, and lay hold of the present opportunity--TO BEGIN GOVERNMENT\nAT THE RIGHT END.\n\nWhen William the Conqueror subdued England, he gave them law at the\npoint of the sword; and until we consent, that the seat of\ngovernment, in America, be legally and authoritatively occupied, we\nshall be in danger of having it filled by some fortunate ruffian, who\nmay treat us in the same manner, and then, where will be our freedom?\nWhere our property?\n\nAs to religion, I hold it to be the indispensible duty of all\ngovernment, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I\nknow of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let\na man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of\nprinciple, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to\npart with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that\nhead. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all\ngood society. For myself, I fully and conscientiously believe, that\nit is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of\nreligious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our\nChristian kindness. Were we all of one way of thinking, our religious\ndispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal\nprinciple, I look on the various denominations among us, to be like\nchildren of the same family, differing only, in what is called, their\nChristian names.\n\nIn page [III par 47], I threw out a few thoughts on\nthe propriety of a Continental Charter, (for I only presume to offer\nhints, not plans) and in this place, I take the liberty of\nrementioning the subject, by observing, that a charter is to be\nunderstood as a bond of solemn obligation, which the whole enters\ninto, to support the right of every separate part, whether or\nreligion, personal freedom, or property. A firm bargain and a right\nreckoning make long friends.\n\nIn a former page I likewise mentioned the necessity of a large and\nequal representation; and there is no political matter which more\ndeserves our attention. A small number of electors, or a small number\nof representatives, are equally dangerous. But if the number of the\nrepresentatives be not only small, but unequal, the danger is\nincreased. As an instance of this, I mention the following; when the\nAssociators petition was before the House of Assembly of\nPennsylvania; twenty-eight members only were present, all the Bucks\ncounty members, being eight, voted against it, and had seven of the\nChester members done the same, this whole province had been governed\nby two counties only, and this danger it is always exposed to. The\nunwarrantable stretch likewise, which that house made in their last\nsitting, to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of that\nprovince, ought to warn the people at large, how they trust power out\nof their own hands. A set of instructions for the Delegates were put\ntogether, which in point of sense and business would have dishonored\na schoolboy, and after being approved by a FEW, a VERY FEW\nwithout doors, were carried into the House, and there passed IN\nBEHALF OF THE WHOLE COLONY; whereas, did the whole colony know, with\nwhat ill-will that House hath entered on some necessary public\nmeasures, they would not hesitate a moment to think them unworthy of\nsuch a trust.\n\nImmediate necessity makes many things convenient, which if\ncontinued would grow into oppressions. Expedience and right are\ndifferent things. When the calamities of America required a\nconsultation, there was no method so ready, or at that time so\nproper, as to appoint persons from the several Houses of Assembly for\nthat purpose; and the wisdom with which they have proceeded hath\npreserved this continent from ruin. But as it is more than probable\nthat we shall never be without a CONGRESS, every well wisher to good\norder, must own, that the mode for choosing members of that body,\ndeserves consideration. And I put it as a question to those, who make\na study of mankind, whether REPRESENTATION AND ELECTION is not too\ngreat a power for one and the same body of men to possess? When we\nare planning for posterity, we ought to remember, that virtue is not\nhereditary.\n\nIt is from our enemies that we often gain excellent maxims, and are\nfrequently surprised into reason by their mistakes. Mr. Cornwall (one\nof the Lords of the Treasury) treated the petition of the New York\nAssembly with contempt, because THAT House, he said, consisted but\nof twenty-six members, which trifling number, he argued, could not\nwith decency be put for the whole. We thank him for his involuntary\nhonesty. [*Note 1]\n\nTO CONCLUDE, however strange it may appear to some, or however\nunwilling they may be to think so, matters not, but many strong and\nstriking reasons may be given, to shew, that nothing can settle our\naffairs so expeditiously as an open and determined declaration for\nindependance. Some of which are,\n\nFIRST--It is the custom of nations, when any two are at war, for\nsome other powers, not engaged in the quarrel, to step in as\nmediators, and bring about the preliminaries of a peace: but while\nAmerica calls herself the Subject of Great Britain, no power, however\nwell disposed she may be, can offer her mediation. Wherefore, in our\npresent state we may quarrel on for ever.\n\nSECONDLY--It is unreasonable to suppose, that France or Spain\nwill give us any kind of assistance, if we mean only, to make use of\nthat assistance for the purpose of repairing the breach, and\nstrengthening the connection between Britain and America; because,\nthose powers would be sufferers by the consequences.\n\nTHIRDLY--While we profess ourselves the subjects of Britain, we\nmust, in the eye of foreign nations, be considered as rebels. The\nprecedent is somewhat dangerous to THEIR PEACE, for men to be in\narms under the name of subjects; we, on the spot, can solve the\nparadox: but to unite resistance and subjection, requires an idea\nmuch too refined for the common understanding.\n\nFOURTHLY--Were a manifesto to be published, and despatched to\nforeign courts, setting forth the miseries we have endured, and the\npeaceable methods we have ineffectually used for redress; declaring,\nat the same time, that not being able, any longer, to live happily or\nsafely under the cruel disposition of the British court, we had been\ndriven to the necessity of breaking off all connections with her; at\nthe same time, assuring all such courts of our peacable disposition\ntowards them, and of our desire of entering into trade with them:\nSuch a memorial would produce more good effects to this Continent,\nthan if a ship were freighted with petitions to Britain.\n\nUnder our present denomination of British subjects, we can neither\nbe received nor heard abroad: The custom of all courts is against us,\nand will be so, until, by an independance, we take rank with other\nnations.\n\nThese proceedings may at first appear strange and difficult; but,\nlike all other steps which we have already passed over, will in a\nlittle time become familiar and agreeable; and, until an independance\nis declared, the Continent will feel itself like a man who continues\nputting off some unpleasant business from day to day, yet knows it\nmust be done, hates to set about it, wishes it over, and is\ncontinually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity.\n\nNote 1  Those who would fully understand of what great consequence a\nlarge and equal representation is to a state, should read Burgh's\npolitical Disquisitions.","chapter_length":4184.0,"summary_name":"Chapter 4","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210212220739\/https:\/\/www.novelguide.com\/common-sense\/summaries\/chap4","summary_text":"On the Present Ability of America, With Some Miscellaneous Reflections The author claims he has never met a person who did not believe America and Britain would one day separate.

He moves past trying to convince readers of the justice of the cause and instead, explains why Americans are ready for war and will be successful. His vision of an American navy is powerful and compelling, showing that the country is far beyond being a colony. It is already mature and should be on its own. It needs to be able to negotiate with other countries as a separate and sovereign power. Paine makes a point of the readiness of the colonials. The colonial people were very well prepared to break away from Britain and rule themselves. Every village had a town hall used to debating local issues. It had a standing civilian militia that drilled and stood ready to march. The colonies had a network set up, a Committee of Correspondence, a resistance force with newspapers, pamphlets , to disperse the ideas that would propel the colonists to fight for their rights. Paine was an important part of this propaganda machine. The Committee circulated the news of British atrocities against the colonials, such as forcing the colonies to buy British products at high prices and with a tax, such as the taxed tea that the colonials threw into the Boston Harbor . The British put tariffs on non-British products. The colonials wanted to conduct their own trade. Most of them were property owners fighting for their own land.","summary_length":352.0,"analysis_length":262.0,"chap_int":4,"previous summary id":["chapter 3"],"previous chapter":["on Thoughts on the Present State of American Affairs Again the author claims to offer \"simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense\" . He will give facts and let the reason of the reader judge for itself. He mentions that volumes have been written already on the pros and cons of separation from England, but now, \"the period of debate is closed. Arms, as the last resource, decide the contest\" . Paine claims that the king has chosen this route by his action. Parliament was prepared to make some slight concessions to Americans but only for a time. Now, the larger view must be taken. The author claims Americans must act for posterity: \"The sun never shone on a cause of greater worth\" . Everything has changed since the 19th of April with the British troops attacking American colonists at Lexington and Concord. This is a new era, and reconciliation is no longer a possibility. Now the injuries of Americans will be discussed. First, he considers the argument that Americans flourished under British protection, and it must therefore continue to be good for them. No, says, Paine, the child has to grow up and leave the parent country . Second, some say Britain protects us from our enemies. Actually, British troops are in America to protect British property, for America is their rich subservient colony. Next, he considers the argument that Britain is the only unifying factor in the colonies that are actually unrelated to one another. Paine says that many colonists did not come from England but from other European countries. Europe is thus the parent of Americans, not England. At any rate, England has made itself the enemy of Americans through its behavior of attack and plunder. Americans do not need Britain. They are rich and dedicated to trade with all of Europe. It is in Europe's interest to have a free America. There is no advantage to remaining with Britain but there are many disadvantages, such as being dragged into European wars. There is the great distance between the two countries that makes it ridiculous for one to rule the other. Separation is inevitable, and this is the right time. Americans are in a precarious situation not knowing if their property is secure while Britain rules. He gives as example the prosperous city of Boston, now under siege. How can we go back and trust a government that has put fire and sword to our citizens? He is not exaggerating, he says, but appealing to \"those feelings and affections which nature justifies\" . Americans have already exhausted every peaceful means. To think the British will change is foolish. They repealed the Stamp Act, but a year or two later there were other taxes and tariffs. The British government cannot do justice in the ruling of America, for it is already too large and complicated. How can a continent be governed by an island? The King is an enemy of liberty and insists on being America's lawgiver. America can never be first in the thoughts of the British government. It cannot attract emigrants when its government is insecure. Finally, it is only continental independence that can keep the land free of civil war. As a republic it can foster equality that will bring peace to the land. In this historical moment, Americans have the chance to invent a better human government. The author gives a few of his ideas of what the new government should be like, such as fostering freedom of religion, and proposes a Continental Congress or Conference to come up with a Charter of the United Colonies. There will be equality and no king, for in America \"THE LAW IS KING\" . There are injuries that cannot be forgiven, so Britain and America must part."],"next summary id":"chapter 4","next chapter":"On the Present Ability of America, With Some Miscellaneous Reflections The author claims he has never met a person who did not believe America and Britain would one day separate.

Right about then Diomedes declares that Antony is not quite dead, but mostly dying. The lovers call to each other. Antony announces that it can never be said that Caesar's valor overthrew Antony; rather, Antony's valor made him overthrow himself. Cleopatra agrees that there's nobility in the fact that no man conquered Antony except Antony himself. Antony calls out to her to come down and give him a final kiss, but she dares not leave the monument for fear that Caesar will catch her and place her in his victory parade. Instead, she begs those around her to help pull her lover's dying body to her. She notes he's heavy, his strength having turned into dull weight, and she wishes her kisses might bring him back to life. Everyone watching is rather moved. Antony begs Cleopatra, with his dying breaths, to seek her honor and safety with Caesar and the one trustworthy man around Caesar--Proculeius. She replies she can't have both her honor and her safety, and that she will resolve this matter with her own hands, rather than seeking pardon from Caesar.

After having rested for two days, the men had tried to find the secret entrance to the treasure chamber, but to no avail. Giving up, they returned to Loo and prepared for their longer journey back to their own country. Ignosi finds their intent to leave disturbing, going so far as to question Quatermain's priorities in loving the precious diamonds more than their friendship. Quatermain replies that, just as Ignosi longed for his homeland when he joined the men in their quest, so do the white men long for their own homes. Somewhat mollified, Ignosi declares that Quatermain, Sir Henry, and Good are the only white men who will ever enter Kukuanaland; he warns the men that any other whites who approach will not be welcomed, and if they do not leave of their own accord they will be driven off or killed. He then declares the names of the three men--their \\\"African\\\" names, will be remembered as the names of gods among the Kukuanas, passed on for generations but never uttered aloud. Just before they leave, Good is approached by a young Kukuana woman bearing flowers. She eagerly desires to see Good's \\\"beautiful white legs\\\" before he leaves. At first Good balks at the prospect of showing his legs, but the cajoling of Sir Henry and Quatermain lead him to roll his pants-leg up to the knee. The woman and several other onlookers stare in awe at Good's white leg before Good makes his departure. The men learn of an alternate--and less perilous--route away from Kukuanaland, along which there is said to be an oasis. The men readily choose this path over the dangers of thirst and wild animals. Infadoos and a group of Kukuanas escort the men as far as the borders of Kukuanaland, then bid them farewell. Before leaving, Good makes Infadoos a gift of his spare monocle, giving the old Kukuana a token of his esteem and a physical badge of honor among the Kukuanas. Three days later the men reach the oasis and make camp by its refreshing waters. As Quatermain surveys the oasis, he comes across a hut . A white man clothed in animal skins, comes out of the hut and looks upon him. Quatermain asks his companions to verify that he is not hallucinating, when Sir Henry recognizes the white man as his brother George. When the men cry out in delight, another figure--this time a black man--exits the hut and addresses Quatermain. This is Jim, whom Quatermain had sent to deliver a note to George over two years ago. As it turns out, George had attempted to reach King Solomon's mines by this route rather than the more dangerous desert way. While camping at the oasis and preparing to head into Kukuanaland, a boulder fell and crushed his leg. Unable to climb the mountains or return the way he came, George settled in to survive at the oasis as long as he could. With Jim's help he built the hut and hunted game, which provided both food and clothing for the men. For two years they have lived this way, never anticipating seeing another human face, let alone these familiar faces. Sir Henry relates his own adventures to his brother, and he concludes with Quatermain showing George the diamonds retrieved from Solomon's treasure chamber. George declares that at least the men have gotten some benefit from their expedition, but Sir Henry insists that the diamonds belong to Quatermain and Good--he only sought to find his brother. Quatermain and Good secretly decide between them to give Sir Henry a third of the diamonds or, if he will not take them, to give them to George, whom they believe has suffered even more than they in his pursuit of King Solomon's Mines. Sir Henry reluctantly agrees. The men make their return journey, taking turns bearing the limping George back to Durban. There Quatermain takes his leave of the other men as they return to England. As Quatermain is writing the final lines of his narrative, a letter arrives from Sir Henry. Sir Henry urges Quatermain to come to England and take up residence near him; a house has recently gone up for sale and the proceeds from selling off a few of the diamonds will pay for the residence. To further entice Quatermain, Sir Henry has had Quatermain's son Harry visit and quite enjoys the young man's company. Quatermain is touched by Sir Henry's desire to have his friend nearby, and ends the narrative declaring his intention to return to England.\", \"analysis\": \"Good's gift to Infadoos is reminiscent of the cargo cult, in which artifacts from a strange culture are made objects of admiration or even worship by another culture.  Good's \\\"glass eye\\\" had fascinated the Kukuanas from the first moment they saw him.  By giving Infadoos a spare monocle, Good imparts to Infadoos a level of respect among the Kukuanas.  Although often an object of humor, it is Good who seems to be most connected to the Kukuanas. The three white men are deified among the Kukuanas.  Their practice of remembering the men's names by never uttering them aloud is strange to the men, but reflects the sanctity with which they regard these men.  However, even as he honors them, Ignosi tells the white men that no other whites will be allowed in Kukuanaland.  Ignosi has seen their influence, and does not wish it to continue among his people.  This final closing of the borders by Ignosi is interesting in that the new king sees the dangers of allowing white\/European culture to infiltrate his land.  Just as he owes his throne to the three white men to some extent, so does he recognize that an imperialistic nation could use force, guile, or technology to place their own favored man on the throne at any time.  Ignosi chooses instead to keep the Kukuanas insular and avoid the negative influence of Europe. At the same time, Ignosi holds these three specific white men in high regard.  When they tell him of their desire to depart, Ignosi says, \\\"It is the bright stones that ye love more than me, your friend\\\" .  In response to this charge of materialism, Quatermain replies that just as Ignosi longed for his homeland, so too do these men long to return to their own nation.  This assuages Ignosi, but it leaves the reader with a sense that the diamonds have become disproportionately valuable to the men--even Sir Henry Curtis has not mentioned his brother lately--and thus the pretext for their adventure has become an empty goal. Haggard leaves no loose ends in his novel.  The purpose of Sir Henry's quest--to find his brother or news of him--is finally achieved, although somewhat by accident.  Sir Henry had become convinced that Neville died en route to Solomon's Mines.  What he did not foresee was that Neville would become incapacitated on the way and never complete the journey, yet still live.  Also, George Neville took a different route than that indicated by da Silvestra's map, and so the evidence of his journey could not be found along the path of Sir Henry's expedition. Although the finding of Sir Henry's brother feels a bit like convenient coincidence, the details of his story mesh well with the events of Quatermain's narrative.  The lack of evidence  and information regarding Neville left Sir Henry in despair, but the lack was not due to his death in the wilderness, but due to his taking a different route and meeting an unexpected obstacle. Although George Neville denies it, the blame for his injury is in some part the fault of Jim, the African hunter of Quatermain's acquaintance.  Although probably intended as a plot device, it is interesting to note that George's injury and Sir Henry's subsequent anxiety and trials are partially the fault of an African native.  Haggard could not have George simply meet with an accident--thus making the man incompetent and no fit brother for the mighty Sir Henry Curtis.  He had to place the burden of the mistake upon another character--a minor African character--in order to meet the expectations of his readership. The issue of materialism is again raised.  Quatermain and Good readily agree to share a third of their diamonds with Sir Henry and, when he refuses, with George Neville as recompense for his suffering in quest for them.  Neville accepts where Sir Henry did not.  Again, Sir Henry Curtis is the ideal hero--brave, compassionate--and in this case content with his station in life and his income level.  Quatermain is no hero--he wants the money, but mostly for his son--but he is human, and thus makes a better point of view character for the novel than would Sir Henry. The story finishes with a letter.  Sir Henry has already made the acquaintance of Quatermain's son and likes the young many very much.  He wants Quatermain to join him and Good in England, where a nearby house has recently opened up.  In this way, the three bachelors can live in luxury and peace for their remaining days.  Quatermain, although restless and a born hunter and explorer, considers taking Sir Henry up on the offer.  He wants to see his son grow up and succeed, and it is in England that he can best achieve that goal.  Like Odysseus, Quatermain is now in a position to retire and finish his son's training in manhood, knowing that his legacy is secure.\"}","chapter":"Ten days from that eventful morning found us once more in our old\nquarters at Loo; and, strange to say, but little the worse for our\nterrible experience, except that my stubbly hair came out of the\ntreasure cave about three shades greyer than it went in, and that Good\nnever was quite the same after Foulata's death, which seemed to move\nhim very greatly. I am bound to say, looking at the thing from the\npoint of view of an oldish man of the world, that I consider her\nremoval was a fortunate occurrence, since, otherwise, complications\nwould have been sure to ensue. The poor creature was no ordinary native\ngirl, but a person of great, I had almost said stately, beauty, and of\nconsiderable refinement of mind. But no amount of beauty or refinement\ncould have made an entanglement between Good and herself a desirable\noccurrence; for, as she herself put it, \"Can the sun mate with the\ndarkness, or the white with the black?\"\n\nI need hardly state that we never again penetrated into Solomon's\ntreasure chamber. After we had recovered from our fatigues, a process\nwhich took us forty-eight hours, we descended into the great pit in the\nhope of finding the hole by which we had crept out of the mountain, but\nwith no success. To begin with, rain had fallen, and obliterated our\nspoor; and what is more, the sides of the vast pit were full of\nant-bear and other holes. It was impossible to say to which of these we\nowed our salvation. Also, on the day before we started back to Loo, we\nmade a further examination of the wonders of the stalactite cave, and,\ndrawn by a kind of restless feeling, even penetrated once more into the\nChamber of the Dead. Passing beneath the spear of the White Death we\ngazed, with sensations which it would be quite impossible for me to\ndescribe, at the mass of rock that had shut us off from escape,\nthinking the while of priceless treasures beyond, of the mysterious old\nhag whose flattened fragments lay crushed beneath it, and of the fair\ngirl of whose tomb it was the portal. I say gazed at the \"rock,\" for,\nexamine as we could, we could find no traces of the join of the sliding\ndoor; nor, indeed, could we hit upon the secret, now utterly lost, that\nworked it, though we tried for an hour or more. It is certainly a\nmarvellous bit of mechanism, characteristic, in its massive and yet\ninscrutable simplicity, of the age which produced it; and I doubt if\nthe world has such another to show.\n\nAt last we gave it up in disgust; though, if the mass had suddenly\nrisen before our eyes, I doubt if we should have screwed up courage to\nstep over Gagool's mangled remains, and once more enter the treasure\nchamber, even in the sure and certain hope of unlimited diamonds. And\nyet I could have cried at the idea of leaving all that treasure, the\nbiggest treasure probably that in the world's history has ever been\naccumulated in one spot. But there was no help for it. Only dynamite\ncould force its way through five feet of solid rock.\n\nSo we left it. Perhaps, in some remote unborn century, a more fortunate\nexplorer may hit upon the \"Open Sesame,\" and flood the world with gems.\nBut, myself, I doubt it. Somehow, I seem to feel that the tens of\nmillions of pounds' worth of jewels which lie in the three stone\ncoffers will never shine round the neck of an earthly beauty. They and\nFoulata's bones will keep cold company till the end of all things.\n\nWith a sigh of disappointment we made our way back, and next day\nstarted for Loo. And yet it was really very ungrateful of us to be\ndisappointed; for, as the reader will remember, by a lucky thought, I\nhad taken the precaution to fill the wide pockets of my old shooting\ncoat and trousers with gems before we left our prison-house, also\nFoulata's basket, which held twice as many more, notwithstanding that\nthe water bottle had occupied some of its space. A good many of these\nfell out in the course of our roll down the side of the pit, including\nseveral of the big ones, which I had crammed in on the top in my coat\npockets. But, comparatively speaking, an enormous quantity still\nremained, including ninety-three large stones ranging from over two\nhundred to seventy carats in weight. My old shooting coat and the\nbasket still held sufficient treasure to make us all, if not\nmillionaires as the term is understood in America, at least exceedingly\nwealthy men, and yet to keep enough stones each to make the three\nfinest sets of gems in Europe. So we had not done so badly.\n\nOn arriving at Loo we were most cordially received by Ignosi, whom we\nfound well, and busily engaged in consolidating his power, and\nreorganising the regiments which had suffered most in the great\nstruggle with Twala.\n\nHe listened with intense interest to our wonderful story; but when we\ntold him of old Gagool's frightful end he grew thoughtful.\n\n\"Come hither,\" he called, to a very old Induna or councillor, who was\nsitting with others in a circle round the king, but out of ear-shot.\nThe ancient man rose, approached, saluted, and seated himself.\n\n\"Thou art aged,\" said Ignosi.\n\n\"Ay, my lord the king! Thy father's father and I were born on the same\nday.\"\n\n\"Tell me, when thou wast little, didst thou know Gagaoola the witch\ndoctress?\"\n\n\"Ay, my lord the king!\"\n\n\"How was she then--young, like thee?\"\n\n\"Not so, my lord the king! She was even as she is now and as she was in\nthe days of my great grandfather before me; old and dried, very ugly,\nand full of wickedness.\"\n\n\"She is no more; she is dead.\"\n\n\"So, O king! then is an ancient curse taken from the land.\"\n\n\"Go!\"\n\n\"_Koom!_ I go, Black Puppy, who tore out the old dog's throat. _Koom!_\"\n\n\"Ye see, my brothers,\" said Ignosi, \"this was a strange woman, and I\nrejoice that she is dead. She would have let you die in the dark place,\nand mayhap afterwards she had found a way to slay me, as she found a\nway to slay my father, and set up Twala, whom her black heart loved, in\nhis place. Now go on with the tale; surely there never was its like!\"\n\nAfter I had narrated all the story of our escape, as we had agreed\nbetween ourselves that I should, I took the opportunity to address\nIgnosi as to our departure from Kukuanaland.\n\n\"And now, Ignosi,\" I said, \"the time has come for us to bid thee\nfarewell, and start to see our own land once more. Behold, Ignosi, thou\ncamest with us a servant, and now we leave thee a mighty king. If thou\nart grateful to us, remember to do even as thou didst promise: to rule\njustly, to respect the law, and to put none to death without a cause.\nSo shalt thou prosper. To-morrow, at break of day, Ignosi, thou wilt\ngive us an escort who shall lead us across the mountains. Is it not so,\nO king?\"\n\nIgnosi covered his face with his hands for a while before answering.\n\n\"My heart is sore,\" he said at last; \"your words split my heart in\ntwain. What have I done to you, Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, that\nye should leave me desolate? Ye who stood by me in rebellion and in\nbattle, will ye leave me in the day of peace and victory? What will\nye--wives? Choose from among the maidens! A place to live in? Behold,\nthe land is yours as far as ye can see. The white man's houses? Ye\nshall teach my people how to build them. Cattle for beef and milk?\nEvery married man shall bring you an ox or a cow. Wild game to hunt?\nDoes not the elephant walk through my forests, and the river-horse\nsleep in the reeds? Would ye make war? My Impis wait your word. If\nthere is anything more which I can give, that will I give you.\"\n\n\"Nay, Ignosi, we want none of these things,\" I answered; \"we would seek\nour own place.\"\n\n\"Now do I learn,\" said Ignosi bitterly, and with flashing eyes, \"that\nye love the bright stones more than me, your friend. Ye have the\nstones; now ye would go to Natal and across the moving black water and\nsell them, and be rich, as it is the desire of a white man's heart to\nbe. Cursed for your sake be the white stones, and cursed he who seeks\nthem. Death shall it be to him who sets foot in the place of Death to\nfind them. I have spoken. White men, ye can go.\"\n\nI laid my hand upon his arm. \"Ignosi,\" I said, \"tell us, when thou\ndidst wander in Zululand, and among the white people of Natal, did not\nthine heart turn to the land thy mother told thee of, thy native place,\nwhere thou didst see the light, and play when thou wast little, the\nland where thy place was?\"\n\n\"It was even so, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"In like manner, Ignosi, do our hearts turn to our land and to our own\nplace.\"\n\nThen came a silence. When Ignosi broke it, it was in a different voice.\n\n\"I do perceive that now as ever thy words are wise and full of reason,\nMacumazahn; that which flies in the air loves not to run along the\nground; the white man loves not to live on the level of the black or to\nhouse among his kraals. Well, ye must go, and leave my heart sore,\nbecause ye will be as dead to me, since from where ye are no tidings\ncan come to me.\n\n\"But listen, and let all your brothers know my words. No other white\nman shall cross the mountains, even if any man live to come so far. I\nwill see no traders with their guns and gin. My people shall fight with\nthe spear, and drink water, like their forefathers before them. I will\nhave no praying-men to put a fear of death into men's hearts, to stir\nthem up against the law of the king, and make a path for the white folk\nwho follow to run on. If a white man comes to my gates I will send him\nback; if a hundred come I will push them back; if armies come, I will\nmake war on them with all my strength, and they shall not prevail\nagainst me. None shall ever seek for the shining stones: no, not an\narmy, for if they come I will send a regiment and fill up the pit, and\nbreak down the white columns in the caves and choke them with rocks, so\nthat none can reach even to that door of which ye speak, and whereof\nthe way to move it is lost. But for you three, Incubu, Macumazahn, and\nBougwan, the path is always open; for, behold, ye are dearer to me than\naught that breathes.\n\n\"And ye would go. Infadoos, my uncle, and my Induna, shall take you by\nthe hand and guide you with a regiment. There is, as I have learned,\nanother way across the mountains that he shall show you. Farewell, my\nbrothers, brave white men. See me no more, for I have no heart to bear\nit. Behold! I make a decree, and it shall be published from the\nmountains to the mountains; your names, Incubu, Macumazahn, and\nBougwan, shall be \"_hlonipa_\" even as the names of dead kings, and he\nwho speaks them shall die.[1] So shall your memory be preserved in the\nland for ever.\n\n\"Go now, ere my eyes rain tears like a woman's. At times as ye look\nback down the path of life, or when ye are old and gather yourselves\ntogether to crouch before the fire, because for you the sun has no more\nheat, ye will think of how we stood shoulder to shoulder, in that great\nbattle which thy wise words planned, Macumazahn; of how thou wast the\npoint of the horn that galled Twala's flank, Bougwan; whilst thou stood\nin the ring of the Greys, Incubu, and men went down before thine axe\nlike corn before a sickle; ay, and of how thou didst break that wild\nbull Twala's strength, and bring his pride to dust. Fare ye well for\never, Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, my lords and my friends.\"\n\nIgnosi rose and looked earnestly at us for a few seconds. Then he threw\nthe corner of his karross over his head, so as to cover his face from\nus.\n\nWe went in silence.\n\n\nNext day at dawn we left Loo, escorted by our old friend Infadoos, who\nwas heart-broken at our departure, and by the regiment of Buffaloes.\nEarly as was the hour, all the main street of the town was lined with\nmultitudes of people, who gave us the royal salute as we passed at the\nhead of the regiment, while the women blessed us for having rid the\nland of Twala, throwing flowers before us as we went. It was really\nvery affecting, and not the sort of thing one is accustomed to meet\nwith from natives.\n\nOne ludicrous incident occurred, however, which I rather welcomed, as\nit gave us something to laugh at.\n\nJust before we reached the confines of the town, a pretty young girl,\nwith some lovely lilies in her hand, ran forward and presented them to\nGood--somehow they all seemed to like Good; I think his eye-glass and\nsolitary whisker gave him a fictitious value--and then said that she\nhad a boon to ask.\n\n\"Speak on,\" he answered.\n\n\"Let my lord show his servant his beautiful white legs, that his\nservant may look upon them, and remember them all her days, and tell of\nthem to her children; his servant has travelled four days' journey to\nsee them, for the fame of them has gone throughout the land.\"\n\n\"I'll be hanged if I do!\" exclaimed Good excitedly.\n\n\"Come, come, my dear fellow,\" said Sir Henry, \"you can't refuse to\noblige a lady.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" replied Good obstinately; \"it is positively indecent.\"\n\nHowever, in the end he consented to draw up his trousers to the knee,\namidst notes of rapturous admiration from all the women present,\nespecially the gratified young lady, and in this guise he had to walk\ntill we got clear of the town.\n\nGood's legs, I fear, will never be so greatly admired again. Of his\nmelting teeth, and even of his \"transparent eye,\" the Kukuanas wearied\nmore or less, but of his legs never.\n\nAs we travelled, Infadoos told us that there was another pass over the\nmountains to the north of the one followed by Solomon's Great Road, or\nrather that there was a place where it was possible to climb down the\nwall of cliff which separates Kukuanaland from the desert, and is\nbroken by the towering shapes of Sheba's Breasts. It appeared, also,\nthat rather more than two years previously a party of Kukuana hunters\nhad descended this path into the desert in search of ostriches, whose\nplumes are much prized among them for war head-dresses, and that in the\ncourse of their hunt they had been led far from the mountains and were\nmuch troubled by thirst. Seeing trees on the horizon, however, they\nwalked towards them, and discovered a large and fertile oasis some\nmiles in extent, and plentifully watered. It was by way of this oasis\nthat Infadoos suggested we should return, and the idea seemed to us a\ngood one, for it appeared that we should thus escape the rigours of the\nmountain pass. Also some of the hunters were in attendance to guide us\nto the oasis, from which, they stated, they could perceive other\nfertile spots far away in the desert.[2]\n\nTravelling easily, on the night of the fourth day's journey we found\nourselves once more on the crest of the mountains that separate\nKukuanaland from the desert, which rolled away in sandy billows at our\nfeet, and about twenty-five miles to the north of Sheba's Breasts.\n\nAt dawn on the following day, we were led to the edge of a very\nprecipitous chasm, by which we were to descend the precipice, and gain\nthe plain two thousand and more feet below.\n\nHere we bade farewell to that true friend and sturdy old warrior,\nInfadoos, who solemnly wished all good upon us, and nearly wept with\ngrief. \"Never, my lords,\" he said, \"shall mine old eyes see the like of\nyou again. Ah! the way that Incubu cut his men down in the battle! Ah!\nfor the sight of that stroke with which he swept off my brother Twala's\nhead! It was beautiful--beautiful! I may never hope to see such\nanother, except perchance in happy dreams.\"\n\nWe were very sorry to part from him; indeed, Good was so moved that he\ngave him as a souvenir--what do you think?--an _eye-glass_; afterwards\nwe discovered that it was a spare one. Infadoos was delighted,\nforeseeing that the possession of such an article would increase his\nprestige enormously, and after several vain attempts he actually\nsucceeded in screwing it into his own eye. Anything more incongruous\nthan the old warrior looked with an eye-glass I never saw. Eye-glasses\ndo not go well with leopard-skin cloaks and black ostrich plumes.\n\nThen, after seeing that our guides were well laden with water and\nprovisions, and having received a thundering farewell salute from the\nBuffaloes, we wrung Infadoos by the hand, and began our downward climb.\nA very arduous business it proved to be, but somehow that evening we\nfound ourselves at the bottom without accident.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Sir Henry that night, as we sat by our fire and\ngazed up at the beetling cliffs above us, \"I think that there are worse\nplaces than Kukuanaland in the world, and that I have known unhappier\ntimes than the last month or two, though I have never spent such queer\nones. Eh! you fellows?\"\n\n\"I almost wish I were back,\" said Good, with a sigh.\n\nAs for myself, I reflected that all's well that ends well; but in the\ncourse of a long life of shaves, I never had such shaves as those which\nI had recently experienced. The thought of that battle makes me feel\ncold all over, and as for our experience in the treasure chamber--!\n\n\nNext morning we started on a toilsome trudge across the desert, having\nwith us a good supply of water carried by our five guides, and camped\nthat night in the open, marching again at dawn on the morrow.\n\nBy noon of the third day's journey we could see the trees of the oasis\nof which the guides spoke, and within an hour of sundown we were\nwalking once more upon grass and listening to the sound of running\nwater.\n\n\n[1] This extraordinary and negative way of showing intense respect is\nby no means unknown among African people, and the result is that if, as\nis usual, the name in question has a significance, the meaning must be\nexpressed by an idiom or other word. In this way a memory is preserved\nfor generations, or until the new word utterly supplants the old.\n\n[2] It often puzzled all of us to understand how it was possible that\nIgnosi's mother, bearing the child with her, should have survived the\ndangers of her journey across the mountains and the desert, dangers\nwhich so nearly proved fatal to ourselves. It has since occurred to me,\nand I give the idea to the reader for what it is worth, that she must\nhave taken this second route, and wandered out like Hagar into the\nwilderness. If she did so, there is no longer anything inexplicable\nabout the story, since, as Ignosi himself related, she may well have\nbeen picked up by some ostrich hunters before she or the child was\nexhausted, was led by them to the oasis, and thence by stages to the\nfertile country, and so on by slow degrees southwards to Zululand.--A.Q.\n\n\nAnd now I come to perhaps the strangest adventure that happened to us\nin all this strange business, and one which shows how wonderfully\nthings are brought about.\n\nI was walking along quietly, some way in front of the other two, down\nthe banks of the stream which runs from the oasis till it is swallowed\nup in the hungry desert sands, when suddenly I stopped and rubbed my\neyes, as well I might. There, not twenty yards in front of me, placed\nin a charming situation, under the shade of a species of fig-tree, and\nfacing to the stream, was a cosy hut, built more or less on the Kafir\nprinciple with grass and withes, but having a full-length door instead\nof a bee-hole.\n\n\"What the dickens,\" said I to myself, \"can a hut be doing here?\" Even\nas I said it the door of the hut opened, and there limped out of it a\n_white man_ clothed in skins, and with an enormous black beard. I\nthought that I must have got a touch of the sun. It was impossible. No\nhunter ever came to such a place as this. Certainly no hunter would\never settle in it. I stared and stared, and so did the other man, and\njust at that juncture Sir Henry and Good walked up.\n\n\"Look here, you fellows,\" I said, \"is that a white man, or am I mad?\"\n\nSir Henry looked, and Good looked, and then all of a sudden the lame\nwhite man with a black beard uttered a great cry, and began hobbling\ntowards us. When he was close he fell down in a sort of faint.\n\nWith a spring Sir Henry was by his side.\n\n\"Great Powers!\" he cried, \"_it is my brother George!_\"\n\nAt the sound of this disturbance, another figure, also clad in skins,\nemerged from the hut, a gun in his hand, and ran towards us. On seeing\nme he too gave a cry.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he halloed, \"don't you know me, Baas? I'm Jim the hunter.\nI lost the note you gave me to give to the Baas, and we have been here\nnearly two years.\" And the fellow fell at my feet, and rolled over and\nover, weeping for joy.\n\n\"You careless scoundrel!\" I said; \"you ought to be well\n_sjambocked_\"--that is, hided.\n\nMeanwhile the man with the black beard had recovered and risen, and he\nand Sir Henry were pump-handling away at each other, apparently without\na word to say. But whatever they had quarrelled about in the past--I\nsuspect it was a lady, though I never asked--it was evidently forgotten\nnow.\n\n\"My dear old fellow,\" burst out Sir Henry at last, \"I thought you were\ndead. I have been over Solomon's Mountains to find you. I had given up\nall hope of ever seeing you again, and now I come across you perched in\nthe desert, like an old _assvoegel_.\"[1]\n\n\"I tried to cross Solomon's Mountains nearly two years ago,\" was the\nanswer, spoken in the hesitating voice of a man who has had little\nrecent opportunity of using his tongue, \"but when I reached here a\nboulder fell on my leg and crushed it, and I have been able to go\nneither forward nor back.\"\n\nThen I came up. \"How do you do, Mr. Neville?\" I said; \"do you remember\nme?\"\n\n\"Why,\" he said, \"isn't it Hunter Quatermain, eh, and Good too? Hold on\na minute, you fellows, I am getting dizzy again. It is all so very\nstrange, and, when a man has ceased to hope, so very happy!\"\n\nThat evening, over the camp fire, George Curtis told us his story,\nwhich, in its way, was almost as eventful as our own, and, put shortly,\namounted to this. A little less than two years before, he had started\nfrom Sitanda's Kraal, to try to reach Suliman's Berg. As for the note I\nhad sent him by Jim, that worthy lost it, and he had never heard of it\ntill to-day. But, acting upon information he had received from the\nnatives, he headed not for Sheba's Breasts, but for the ladder-like\ndescent of the mountains down which we had just come, which is clearly\na better route than that marked out in old Dom Silvestra's plan. In the\ndesert he and Jim had suffered great hardships, but finally they\nreached this oasis, where a terrible accident befell George Curtis. On\nthe day of their arrival he was sitting by the stream, and Jim was\nextracting the honey from the nest of a stingless bee which is to be\nfound in the desert, on the top of a bank immediately above him. In so\ndoing he loosened a great boulder of rock, which fell upon George\nCurtis's right leg, crushing it frightfully. From that day he had been\nso lame that he found it impossible to go either forward or back, and\nhad preferred to take the chances of dying in the oasis to the\ncertainty of perishing in the desert.\n\nAs for food, however, they got on pretty well, for they had a good\nsupply of ammunition, and the oasis was frequented, especially at\nnight, by large quantities of game, which came thither for water. These\nthey shot, or trapped in pitfalls, using the flesh for food, and, after\ntheir clothes wore out, the hides for clothing.\n\n\"And so,\" George Curtis ended, \"we have lived for nearly two years,\nlike a second Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday, hoping against hope\nthat some natives might come here to help us away, but none have come.\nOnly last night we settled that Jim should leave me, and try to reach\nSitanda's Kraal to get assistance. He was to go to-morrow, but I had\nlittle hope of ever seeing him back again. And now _you_, of all people\nin the world, _you_, who, as I fancied, had long ago forgotten all\nabout me, and were living comfortably in old England, turn up in a\npromiscuous way and find me where you least expected. It is the most\nwonderful thing that I have ever heard of, and the most merciful too.\"\n\nThen Sir Henry set to work, and told him the main facts of our\nadventures, sitting till late into the night to do it.\n\n\"By Jove!\" said George Curtis, when I showed him some of the diamonds:\n\"well, at least you have got something for your pains, besides my\nworthless self.\"\n\nSir Henry laughed. \"They belong to Quatermain and Good. It was a part\nof the bargain that they should divide any spoils there might be.\"\n\nThis remark set me thinking, and having spoken to Good, I told Sir\nHenry that it was our joint wish that he should take a third portion of\nthe diamonds, or, if he would not, that his share should be handed to\nhis brother, who had suffered even more than ourselves on the chance of\ngetting them. Finally, we prevailed upon him to consent to this\narrangement, but George Curtis did not know of it until some time\nafterwards.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nHere, at this point, I think that I shall end my history. Our journey\nacross the desert back to Sitanda's Kraal was most arduous, especially\nas we had to support George Curtis, whose right leg was very weak\nindeed, and continually threw out splinters of bone. But we did\naccomplish it somehow, and to give its details would only be to\nreproduce much of what happened to us on the former occasion.\n\nSix months from the date of our re-arrival at Sitanda's, where we found\nour guns and other goods quite safe, though the old rascal in charge\nwas much disgusted at our surviving to claim them, saw us all once more\nsafe and sound at my little place on the Berea, near Durban, where I am\nnow writing. Thence I bid farewell to all who have accompanied me\nthrough the strangest trip I ever made in the course of a long and\nvaried experience.\n\nP.S.--Just as I had written the last word, a Kafir came up my avenue of\norange trees, carrying a letter in a cleft stick, which he had brought\nfrom the post. It turned out to be from Sir Henry, and as it speaks for\nitself I give it in full.\n\n  October 1, 1884.\n  Brayley Hall, Yorkshire.\n\n  My Dear Quatermain,\n\n  I send you a line a few mails back to say that the three of us,\n  George, Good, and myself, fetched up all right in England. We got\n  off the boat at Southampton, and went up to town. You should have\n  seen what a swell Good turned out the very next day, beautifully\n  shaved, frock coat fitting like a glove, brand new eye-glass,\n  etc., etc. I went and walked in the park with him, where I met\n  some people I know, and at once told them the story of his\n  \"beautiful white legs.\"\n\n  He is furious, especially as some ill-natured person has printed\n  it in a Society paper.\n\n  To come to business, Good and I took the diamonds to Streeter's to\n  be valued, as we arranged, and really I am afraid to tell you what\n  they put them at, it seems so enormous. They say that of course it\n  is more or less guess-work, as such stones have never to their\n  knowledge been put on the market in anything like such quantities.\n  It appears that (with the exception of one or two of the largest)\n  they are of the finest water, and equal in every way to the best\n  Brazilian stones. I asked them if they would buy them, but they\n  said that it was beyond their power to do so, and recommended us\n  to sell by degrees, over a period of years indeed, for fear lest\n  we should flood the market. They offer, however, a hundred and\n  eighty thousand for a very small portion of them.\n\n  You must come home, Quatermain, and see about these things,\n  especially if you insist upon making the magnificent present of\n  the third share, which does _not_ belong to me, to my brother\n  George. As for Good, he is _no good_. His time is too much\n  occupied in shaving, and other matters connected with the vain\n  adorning of the body. But I think he is still down on his luck\n  about Foulata. He told me that since he had been home he hadn't\n  seen a woman to touch her, either as regards her figure or the\n  sweetness of her expression.\n\n  I want you to come home, my dear old comrade, and to buy a house\n  near here. You have done your day's work, and have lots of money\n  now, and there is a place for sale quite close which would suit\n  you admirably. Do come; the sooner the better; you can finish\n  writing the story of our adventures on board ship. We have refused\n  to tell the tale till it is written by you, for fear lest we shall\n  not be believed. If you start on receipt of this you will reach\n  here by Christmas, and I book you to stay with me for that. Good\n  is coming, and George; and so, by the way, is your boy Harry\n  (there's a bribe for you). I have had him down for a week's\n  shooting, and like him. He is a cool young hand; he shot me in the\n  leg, cut out the pellets, and then remarked upon the advantages of\n  having a medical student with every shooting party!\n\n  Good-bye, old boy; I can't say any more, but I know that you will\n  come, if it is only to oblige\n\n  Your sincere friend,\n  Henry Curtis.\n\n  P.S.--The tusks of the great bull that killed poor Khiva have now\n  been put up in the hall here, over the pair of buffalo horns you\n  gave me, and look magnificent; and the axe with which I chopped\n  off Twala's head is fixed above my writing-table. I wish that we\n  could have managed to bring away the coats of chain armour. Don't\n  lose poor Foulata's basket in which you brought away the diamonds.\n\n  H.C.\n\nTo-day is Tuesday. There is a steamer going on Friday, and I really\nthink that I must take Curtis at his word, and sail by her for England,\nif it is only to see you, Harry, my boy, and to look after the printing\nof this history, which is a task that I do not like to trust to anybody\nelse.\n\n\nALLAN QUATERMAIN.\n\n\n[1] Vulture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":5160.0,"summary_name":"Chapters 19 and 20","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200804024551\/https:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/king-solomons-mines\/study-guide\/summary-chapters-19-and-20","summary_text":"Ten days after escaping the dark chambers of Solomon's treasure store, Quatermain, Sir Henry, and Good find themselves back in Loo. After having rested for two days, the men had tried to find the secret entrance to the treasure chamber, but to no avail. Giving up, they returned to Loo and prepared for their longer journey back to their own country. Ignosi finds their intent to leave disturbing, going so far as to question Quatermain's priorities in loving the precious diamonds more than their friendship. Quatermain replies that, just as Ignosi longed for his homeland when he joined the men in their quest, so do the white men long for their own homes. Somewhat mollified, Ignosi declares that Quatermain, Sir Henry, and Good are the only white men who will ever enter Kukuanaland; he warns the men that any other whites who approach will not be welcomed, and if they do not leave of their own accord they will be driven off or killed. He then declares the names of the three men--their \"African\" names, will be remembered as the names of gods among the Kukuanas, passed on for generations but never uttered aloud. Just before they leave, Good is approached by a young Kukuana woman bearing flowers. She eagerly desires to see Good's \"beautiful white legs\" before he leaves. At first Good balks at the prospect of showing his legs, but the cajoling of Sir Henry and Quatermain lead him to roll his pants-leg up to the knee. The woman and several other onlookers stare in awe at Good's white leg before Good makes his departure. The men learn of an alternate--and less perilous--route away from Kukuanaland, along which there is said to be an oasis. The men readily choose this path over the dangers of thirst and wild animals. Infadoos and a group of Kukuanas escort the men as far as the borders of Kukuanaland, then bid them farewell. Before leaving, Good makes Infadoos a gift of his spare monocle, giving the old Kukuana a token of his esteem and a physical badge of honor among the Kukuanas. Three days later the men reach the oasis and make camp by its refreshing waters. As Quatermain surveys the oasis, he comes across a hut . A white man clothed in animal skins, comes out of the hut and looks upon him. Quatermain asks his companions to verify that he is not hallucinating, when Sir Henry recognizes the white man as his brother George. When the men cry out in delight, another figure--this time a black man--exits the hut and addresses Quatermain. This is Jim, whom Quatermain had sent to deliver a note to George over two years ago. As it turns out, George had attempted to reach King Solomon's mines by this route rather than the more dangerous desert way. While camping at the oasis and preparing to head into Kukuanaland, a boulder fell and crushed his leg. Unable to climb the mountains or return the way he came, George settled in to survive at the oasis as long as he could. With Jim's help he built the hut and hunted game, which provided both food and clothing for the men. For two years they have lived this way, never anticipating seeing another human face, let alone these familiar faces. Sir Henry relates his own adventures to his brother, and he concludes with Quatermain showing George the diamonds retrieved from Solomon's treasure chamber. George declares that at least the men have gotten some benefit from their expedition, but Sir Henry insists that the diamonds belong to Quatermain and Good--he only sought to find his brother. Quatermain and Good secretly decide between them to give Sir Henry a third of the diamonds or, if he will not take them, to give them to George, whom they believe has suffered even more than they in his pursuit of King Solomon's Mines. Sir Henry reluctantly agrees. The men make their return journey, taking turns bearing the limping George back to Durban. There Quatermain takes his leave of the other men as they return to England. As Quatermain is writing the final lines of his narrative, a letter arrives from Sir Henry. Sir Henry urges Quatermain to come to England and take up residence near him; a house has recently gone up for sale and the proceeds from selling off a few of the diamonds will pay for the residence. To further entice Quatermain, Sir Henry has had Quatermain's son Harry visit and quite enjoys the young man's company. Quatermain is touched by Sir Henry's desire to have his friend nearby, and ends the narrative declaring his intention to return to England.","summary_analysis":"Good's gift to Infadoos is reminiscent of the cargo cult, in which artifacts from a strange culture are made objects of admiration or even worship by another culture.  Good's \"glass eye\" had fascinated the Kukuanas from the first moment they saw him.  By giving Infadoos a spare monocle, Good imparts to Infadoos a level of respect among the Kukuanas.  Although often an object of humor, it is Good who seems to be most connected to the Kukuanas. The three white men are deified among the Kukuanas.  Their practice of remembering the men's names by never uttering them aloud is strange to the men, but reflects the sanctity with which they regard these men.  However, even as he honors them, Ignosi tells the white men that no other whites will be allowed in Kukuanaland.  Ignosi has seen their influence, and does not wish it to continue among his people.  This final closing of the borders by Ignosi is interesting in that the new king sees the dangers of allowing white\/European culture to infiltrate his land.  Just as he owes his throne to the three white men to some extent, so does he recognize that an imperialistic nation could use force, guile, or technology to place their own favored man on the throne at any time.  Ignosi chooses instead to keep the Kukuanas insular and avoid the negative influence of Europe. At the same time, Ignosi holds these three specific white men in high regard.  When they tell him of their desire to depart, Ignosi says, \"It is the bright stones that ye love more than me, your friend\" .  In response to this charge of materialism, Quatermain replies that just as Ignosi longed for his homeland, so too do these men long to return to their own nation.  This assuages Ignosi, but it leaves the reader with a sense that the diamonds have become disproportionately valuable to the men--even Sir Henry Curtis has not mentioned his brother lately--and thus the pretext for their adventure has become an empty goal. Haggard leaves no loose ends in his novel.  The purpose of Sir Henry's quest--to find his brother or news of him--is finally achieved, although somewhat by accident.  Sir Henry had become convinced that Neville died en route to Solomon's Mines.  What he did not foresee was that Neville would become incapacitated on the way and never complete the journey, yet still live.  Also, George Neville took a different route than that indicated by da Silvestra's map, and so the evidence of his journey could not be found along the path of Sir Henry's expedition. Although the finding of Sir Henry's brother feels a bit like convenient coincidence, the details of his story mesh well with the events of Quatermain's narrative.  The lack of evidence  and information regarding Neville left Sir Henry in despair, but the lack was not due to his death in the wilderness, but due to his taking a different route and meeting an unexpected obstacle. Although George Neville denies it, the blame for his injury is in some part the fault of Jim, the African hunter of Quatermain's acquaintance.  Although probably intended as a plot device, it is interesting to note that George's injury and Sir Henry's subsequent anxiety and trials are partially the fault of an African native.  Haggard could not have George simply meet with an accident--thus making the man incompetent and no fit brother for the mighty Sir Henry Curtis.  He had to place the burden of the mistake upon another character--a minor African character--in order to meet the expectations of his readership. The issue of materialism is again raised.  Quatermain and Good readily agree to share a third of their diamonds with Sir Henry and, when he refuses, with George Neville as recompense for his suffering in quest for them.  Neville accepts where Sir Henry did not.  Again, Sir Henry Curtis is the ideal hero--brave, compassionate--and in this case content with his station in life and his income level.  Quatermain is no hero--he wants the money, but mostly for his son--but he is human, and thus makes a better point of view character for the novel than would Sir Henry. The story finishes with a letter.  Sir Henry has already made the acquaintance of Quatermain's son and likes the young many very much.  He wants Quatermain to join him and Good in England, where a nearby house has recently opened up.  In this way, the three bachelors can live in luxury and peace for their remaining days.  Quatermain, although restless and a born hunter and explorer, considers taking Sir Henry up on the offer.  He wants to see his son grow up and succeed, and it is in England that he can best achieve that goal.  Like Odysseus, Quatermain is now in a position to retire and finish his son's training in manhood, knowing that his legacy is secure.","summary_length":779.0,"analysis_length":845.0,"chap_int":20,"previous summary id":[],"previous chapter":[],"next summary id":"chapters 19-20","next chapter":"Ten days after escaping the dark chambers of Solomon's treasure store, Quatermain, Sir Henry, and Good find themselves back in Loo. After having rested for two days, the men had tried to find the secret entrance to the treasure chamber, but to no avail. Giving up, they returned to Loo and prepared for their longer journey back to their own country. Ignosi finds their intent to leave disturbing, going so far as to question Quatermain's priorities in loving the precious diamonds more than their friendship. Quatermain replies that, just as Ignosi longed for his homeland when he joined the men in their quest, so do the white men long for their own homes. Somewhat mollified, Ignosi declares that Quatermain, Sir Henry, and Good are the only white men who will ever enter Kukuanaland; he warns the men that any other whites who approach will not be welcomed, and if they do not leave of their own accord they will be driven off or killed. He then declares the names of the three men--their \"African\" names, will be remembered as the names of gods among the Kukuanas, passed on for generations but never uttered aloud. Just before they leave, Good is approached by a young Kukuana woman bearing flowers. She eagerly desires to see Good's \"beautiful white legs\" before he leaves. At first Good balks at the prospect of showing his legs, but the cajoling of Sir Henry and Quatermain lead him to roll his pants-leg up to the knee. The woman and several other onlookers stare in awe at Good's white leg before Good makes his departure. The men learn of an alternate--and less perilous--route away from Kukuanaland, along which there is said to be an oasis. The men readily choose this path over the dangers of thirst and wild animals. Infadoos and a group of Kukuanas escort the men as far as the borders of Kukuanaland, then bid them farewell. Before leaving, Good makes Infadoos a gift of his spare monocle, giving the old Kukuana a token of his esteem and a physical badge of honor among the Kukuanas. Three days later the men reach the oasis and make camp by its refreshing waters. As Quatermain surveys the oasis, he comes across a hut . A white man clothed in animal skins, comes out of the hut and looks upon him. Quatermain asks his companions to verify that he is not hallucinating, when Sir Henry recognizes the white man as his brother George. When the men cry out in delight, another figure--this time a black man--exits the hut and addresses Quatermain. This is Jim, whom Quatermain had sent to deliver a note to George over two years ago. As it turns out, George had attempted to reach King Solomon's mines by this route rather than the more dangerous desert way. While camping at the oasis and preparing to head into Kukuanaland, a boulder fell and crushed his leg. Unable to climb the mountains or return the way he came, George settled in to survive at the oasis as long as he could. With Jim's help he built the hut and hunted game, which provided both food and clothing for the men. For two years they have lived this way, never anticipating seeing another human face, let alone these familiar faces. Sir Henry relates his own adventures to his brother, and he concludes with Quatermain showing George the diamonds retrieved from Solomon's treasure chamber. George declares that at least the men have gotten some benefit from their expedition, but Sir Henry insists that the diamonds belong to Quatermain and Good--he only sought to find his brother. Quatermain and Good secretly decide between them to give Sir Henry a third of the diamonds or, if he will not take them, to give them to George, whom they believe has suffered even more than they in his pursuit of King Solomon's Mines. Sir Henry reluctantly agrees. The men make their return journey, taking turns bearing the limping George back to Durban. There Quatermain takes his leave of the other men as they return to England. As Quatermain is writing the final lines of his narrative, a letter arrives from Sir Henry. Sir Henry urges Quatermain to come to England and take up residence near him; a house has recently gone up for sale and the proceeds from selling off a few of the diamonds will pay for the residence. To further entice Quatermain, Sir Henry has had Quatermain's son Harry visit and quite enjoys the young man's company. Quatermain is touched by Sir Henry's desire to have his friend nearby, and ends the narrative declaring his intention to return to England."}

They find the land brutalized by Picrochole's armies. Through the help of powerful neighbors, they begin to plan an attack. Gargantua's friend, Gymnast, along with Prelingot, scout out the land to find out where the armies are located. In the midst of their scouting, they are surrounded by a platoon of soldiers. Gymnast feigns that he is possessed, performs horse tricks, and scares off most of the soldiers; then, he kills Captain Tripet, the captain of the soldiers. Upon arriving at the castle near the ford of Vede, Gargantua's horse urinates, and in doing so floods the land and over-floods the ford, which takes out a large portion of the enemy armies. To fight off the remaining enemies, Gargantua uproots a tree and fashions it into a lance. He moves to attack the castle, and the enemies within start to fire weapons of all sorts. Thanks to Gargantua's giant size, however, the bullets and cannon balls do not penetrate Gargantua's body. Gargantua takes his recently made lance and knocks over the castle, thus winning the battle. Gargantua and his company return to Grangousier's castle. Gargantua combs out his hair just prior to dinner, and out fall cannon balls and bullets, which Gargantua's father mistakes for lice. Ponocrates explains that as Gargantua's tutor and friend, he would never let him stay in a place so infested, and then Ponocrates proves that what has fallen from Gargantua's hair is indeed cannon balls and nothing more. After the battle, Grangousier provides a large feast. Gargantua craves a salad, and goes out to the garden to pick lettuce. Within the garden, however, six pilgrims from Picrochole's lands are hiding. They are afraid that they will be mistaken for spies, so they hide in Gargantua's garden; but since they are hiding so quietly, Gargantua does not see them, and picks them up with the heads of lettuce. He mixes them into a salad and nearly devours them, but the pilgrims are clever enough to grab hold of Gargantua's teeth, thus avoiding being swallowed. Gargantua picks out the pilgrims with a toothpick and flicks them aside, but Gargantua still does not see them. Gargantua then relieves himself, and in doing so his urine carries away the refuse, including the pilgrims. Gargantua and his company hear much about all the other skirmishes in the land. After hearing about Friar John, Gargantua wishes to meet the man, and so sends him a request for his company. Friar John arrives and is welcomed with much warmth by Gargantua. Friar John then sits, eats, and drinks with Gargantua, Grangousier, Eudemon, Gymnast, and Ponocrates. The men joke, discuss the war, talk about why people dislike monks, and then discuss how Friar John's nose acquired its particular shape. The next day, Gargantua and his company, joined by Friar John, make their way into battle. Friar John uses great words to motivate the company, but as he talks he neglects to pay attention to his surroundings, and accidentally gets stuck in a tree. Luckily, Gymnast and the others help him out. During the battle, Gargantua and his fellows, along with a small army, realize that they may be outnumbered, but that Picrochole's armies are untrained and undisciplined. Friar John loudly encourages his comrades to fight, regardless of the size of the enemy, but in doing so he gives away their location. The battle ensues. In the midst of battle, Friar John gets captured, but kills his captors and takes one of the enemy's leaders, Touchfaucet, as his prisoner. Gargantua and his company, including Friar John and his prisoner, return to Grangousier's castle. Grangousier explains to Touchfaucet that he will be set free, but that he must encourage his master to stop this war. Touchfaucet returns to Picrochole and begs him to negotiate peace, but to no avail. Touchfaucet is called a traitor, kills one of the other military captains, Rashcalf, and then Picrochole orders his guards to kill Touchfaucet. As the war continues, surrounding countries pledge loyalty to Grangousier, since they know that Picrochole fights unjustly without cause. Grangousier thanks all who have pledged loyalty to him, but he announces that he wishes to end the conflict quickly without wasting more lives. Meanwhile, Picrochole's armies are losing morale, as they hear word about how Grangousier's army is growing. In addition, Picrochole's armies are running out of food and supplies. Grangousier, Gargantua, and Gargantua's friends decide that they must plan a strategy that will end the war immediately. They position their armies to flank and surround their enemies. Friar John leads a battalion and manages to capture a large portion of Picrochole's army. Gargantua and his armies attack Picrochole directly; in the chaos of war, however, Picrochole, his servants, and his armies retreat, leaving Gargantua and his followers as the victors. With the war clearly over, Picrochole runs away, becomes separated from his people, and finds himself alone. He tries to find his way back, but ends up being beaten, his clothes ripped into shreds. According to rumor, he ends up a lowly porter in some other kingdom. Gargantua announces his victory with a humble story about one of his father's previous enemies, King Alpharbal. Like Picrochole, King Alpharbal was obsessed with conquest and pillaging. Upon being captured, Grangousier did not enslave or beat his enemy, and instead treated him with great kindness and allowed him to go home. King Alpharbal was so amazed by such kindness that he forever swore loyalty to Grangousier. Therefore, Gargantua announces that he will treat their current prisoners with the same kindness. Since Picrochole is nowhere to be found, and therefore cannot run his kingdom, ownership of the kingdom will fall upon Picrochole's son, who is too young to rule. To protect Picrochole's son, Gargantua appoints Ponocrates as the steward\/governor of the land, until such time that Picrochole's son may rule. Gargantua awards each of his friends and servants, , with lands, titles, and castles, as a way to thank them for joining him in battle. To reward Friar John, he offers him dominion over some of the more famous abbeys, to which Friar John cannot accept, for he finds those abbeys corrupt, and requests the ability to build a different kind of abbey, which he names the Abbey of Thelme. Designed and constructed under the guidance of the Gargantua and Friar John, the Abbey of Thelme would be like no other abbey before it. The only rule of the abbey would be to \\\"do as thou wilt,\\\" implying that no one shall keep time, and that everyone would be free to live their lives as they wish. It would have no walls, for walls create conspiracy. The abbey would house both men and women, and it would allow the men and women to fraternize and even be married to one another. Many women would be educated here in a mostly egalitarian fashion, although certain chores and duties would still be assigned as gender-specific. The entire abbey would be built like an immaculate castle, and the persons living within would be garbed in decadent clothing. The narrator describes that even though these people would live very well, that they somehow would not allow such a decadent form of living to corrupt them or take up their time in a negative fashion. While they would be allowed to do what they wish, they must do so in accordance with leading good, noble, and productive lives. Upon breaking ground for the construction of the abbey, Gargantua and Friar John find a riddle carved into a piece of copper. Gargantua interprets the riddle as a religious metaphor, namely that individuals must seek out God and not allow earthly matters to drag them down to vice. Friar John, on the other hand, does not interpret the riddle as such. Instead, he interprets the poem more basely as the description of a tennis match. According to Friar John, players go against their opponents, as friends or enemies arrange matches. After each match, the players rest, refresh themselves, and then make themselves ready to play again. Those who win their matches are exceedingly happy, but even those who lose are still happy to some degree.\", \"analysis\": \"The climax of book one occurs in the second half of the story. Gargantua and his comrades take part in several battles. As they do so, the narrator goes into further detail concerning the characterization of the supporting characters. Gymnast, for example, appears in the first half of the book as a man skilled in horseback riding and military strategy. In the battlefield, we witness his knowledge put to the test. Not only does he use strategy to scout out the enemy, but he also proves his ability to be a great judge of character. Through watching the enemy, he establishes that the enemy soldiers lack discipline. Gymnast also realizes that these undisciplined soldiers are naive and subject to superstitious fear. When captured, Gymnast cleverly feigns demon possession to throw his assailants off-guard and to win the day. The further characterization of Friar John continues the seemingly split personality of the silly monk and the warrior monk. In preparing for battle, though, the silly monk becomes full of bravado. His overconfidence satirically mocks the clergy and, to some degree, the military, since it demonstrates how soldiers and leaders preparing for war become so focused and excited that they become blind to their surroundings. In the case of Friar John, as he tries to encourage Gargantua and his compatriots, Friar John somehow manages to get himself hung up in a tree and unable to proceed. He also talks too loudly at times, giving their position away to the enemy. After so many military blunders, Friar John gets captured and taken away, but that is when the warrior monk comes out. Oddly enough, Friar John's warrior abilities seem most pronounced when he stands separate from his associates. Even in the final battle, he fights and captures a battalion far removed from where Gargantua and the others are fighting. From the point of view of the writer, Rabelais may have felt that without someone playing the role of comedic relief that his story would have gone out of satire and into the realm of comedic drama. That could explain why Friar John's character leans toward the silly monk persona when he is in the company Gargantua has compatriots. After the war is over and Picrochole's armies are defeated, Rabelais uses a clever flashback strategy to explain the ideals of Utopia, Gargantua's homeland. Within the flashback, Gargantua tells the story about one of his father's previous enemies, Alpharbal, and how his father treated his enemy with compassion instead of malice. That compassion was rewarded with Alpharbal swearing lifelong allegiance to Grangousier. As an exposition, the flashback serves two purposes. First of all, it further establishes Grangousier as a kind and pacifistic ruler, regardless of his hedonistic ways in the beginning of the book. The flashback also foreshadows how Gargantua will run his kingdom and how he will train his son to rule. To further establish how Gargantua will run his kingdom, he and Friar John get into a conversation about how to redesign the ideal abbey. However, this conversation about the Abbey of Thelme is peculiarly juxtaposed against the character of Picrochole, the warmongering king. In her article, \\\"Was Picrochole Free? Rabelais between Luther and Erasmus,\\\" Eva Kushner discusses this strange pairing of topics. She points out how Gargantua and Friar John foresee that the Abbey of Thelme will house the most skilled and virtuous men and women in the land, and since they are born of noble birth, it will be in their nature to remain peaceful and dedicated to God. This very statement implies that those of nobility have an innate nature to act in a particular way. As Kushner explains, Picrochole is an educated man of noble birth, and yet he started a war without sufficient evidence. Worse than not, he refused to negotiate and would not listen to reason. Kushner posits that Rabelais's purpose behind these contradicting elements is to promote a satirical methodology showcasing how the ideals of Thelme may not hold true in the real world, since \\\"a man, who is furthermore endowed with royal power, will misuse his freedom and ignore that of other men,\\\" . Therefore, a place such as Thelme cannot function to the extent of the ideals dreamed by Gargantua and Friar John, unless such a place remains outside of the control of monarchies. Even then, whoever possesses decision-making power over Thelme, presumably Friar John, may also be susceptible to the corrupting forces of absolute power.\"}","chapter":"How Gargantua left the city of Paris to succour his country, and how\nGymnast encountered with the enemy.\n\nIn this same very hour Gargantua, who was gone out of Paris as soon as he\nhad read his father's letters, coming upon his great mare, had already\npassed the Nunnery-bridge, himself, Ponocrates, Gymnast, and Eudemon, who\nall three, the better to enable them to go along with him, took\npost-horses.  The rest of his train came after him by even journeys at a\nslower pace, bringing with them all his books and philosophical instruments.\nAs soon as he had alighted at Parille, he was informed by a farmer of\nGouguet how Picrochole had fortified himself within the rock Clermond, and\nhad sent Captain Tripet with a great army to set upon the wood of Vede and\nVaugaudry, and that they had already plundered the whole country, not\nleaving cock nor hen, even as far as to the winepress of Billard.  These\nstrange and almost incredible news of the enormous abuses thus committed\nover all the land, so affrighted Gargantua that he knew not what to say nor\ndo.  But Ponocrates counselled him to go unto the Lord of Vauguyon, who at\nall times had been their friend and confederate, and that by him they should\nbe better advised in their business.  Which they did incontinently, and\nfound him very willing and fully resolved to assist them, and therefore was\nof opinion that they should send some one of his company to scout along and\ndiscover the country, to learn in what condition and posture the enemy was,\nthat they might take counsel, and proceed according to the present occasion.\nGymnast offered himself to go.  Whereupon it was concluded, that for his\nsafety and the better expedition, he should have with him someone that knew\nthe ways, avenues, turnings, windings, and rivers thereabout. Then away went\nhe and Prelingot, the equerry or gentleman of Vauguyon's horse, who scouted\nand espied as narrowly as they could upon all quarters without any fear.  In\nthe meantime Gargantua took a little refreshment, ate somewhat himself, the\nlike did those who were with him, and caused to give to his mare a picotine\nof oats, that is, three score and fourteen quarters and three bushels.\nGymnast and his comrade rode so long, that at last they met with the enemy's\nforces, all scattered and out of order, plundering, stealing, robbing, and\npillaging all they could lay their hands on.  And, as far off as they could\nperceive him, they ran thronging upon the back of one another in all haste\ntowards him, to unload him of his money, and untruss his portmantles.  Then\ncried he out unto them, My masters, I am a poor devil, I desire you to spare\nme.  I have yet one crown left.  Come, we must drink it, for it is aurum\npotabile, and this horse here shall be sold to pay my welcome.  Afterwards\ntake me for one of your own, for never yet was there any man that knew\nbetter how to take, lard, roast, and dress, yea, by G--, to tear asunder and\ndevour a hen, than I that am here:  and for my proficiat I drink to all good\nfellows.  With that he unscrewed his borracho (which was a great Dutch\nleathern bottle), and without putting in his nose drank very honestly.  The\nmaroufle rogues looked upon him, opening their throats a foot wide, and\nputting out their tongues like greyhounds, in hopes to drink after him; but\nCaptain Tripet, in the very nick of that their expectation, came running to\nhim to see who it was.  To him Gymnast offered his bottle, saying, Hold,\ncaptain, drink boldly and spare not; I have been thy taster, it is wine of\nLa Faye Monjau.  What! said Tripet, this fellow gibes and flouts us?  Who\nart thou? said Tripet.  I am, said Gymnast, a poor devil (pauvre diable).\nHa, said Tripet, seeing thou art a poor devil, it is reason that thou\nshouldst be permitted to go whithersoever thou wilt, for all poor devils\npass everywhere without toll or tax.  But it is not the custom of poor\ndevils to be so well mounted; therefore, sir devil, come down, and let me\nhave your horse, and if he do not carry me well, you, master devil, must do\nit:  for I love a life that such a devil as you should carry me away.\n\n\n\n\nHow Gymnast very souply and cunningly killed Captain Tripet and others of\nPicrochole's men.\n\nWhen they heard these words, some amongst them began to be afraid, and\nblessed themselves with both hands, thinking indeed that he had been a\ndevil disguised, insomuch that one of them, named Good John, captain of the\ntrained bands of the country bumpkins, took his psalter out of his\ncodpiece, and cried out aloud, Hagios ho theos.  If thou be of God, speak;\nif thou be of the other spirit, avoid hence, and get thee going.  Yet he\nwent not away.  Which words being heard by all the soldiers that were\nthere, divers of them being a little inwardly terrified, departed from the\nplace.  All this did Gymnast very well remark and consider, and therefore\nmaking as if he would have alighted from off his horse, as he was poising\nhimself on the mounting side, he most nimbly, with his short sword by his\nthigh, shifting his foot in the stirrup, performed the stirrup-leather\nfeat, whereby, after the inclining of his body downwards, he forthwith\nlaunched himself aloft in the air, and placed both his feet together on the\nsaddle, standing upright with his back turned towards the horse's head.\nNow, said he, my case goes backward.  Then suddenly in the same very\nposture wherein he was, he fetched a gambol upon one foot, and, turning to\nthe left hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly round, just into its\nformer stance, without missing one jot.  Ha, said Tripet, I will not do\nthat at this time, and not without cause.  Well, said Gymnast, I have\nfailed, I will undo this leap.  Then with a marvellous strength and\nagility, turning towards the right hand, he fetched another frisking gambol\nas before, which done, he set his right-hand thumb upon the hind-bow of the\nsaddle, raised himself up, and sprung in the air, poising and upholding his\nwhole body upon the muscle and nerve of the said thumb, and so turned and\nwhirled himself about three times.  At the fourth, reversing his body, and\noverturning it upside down, and foreside back, without touching anything,\nhe brought himself betwixt the horse's two ears, springing with all his\nbody into the air, upon the thumb of his left hand, and in that posture,\nturning like a windmill, did most actively do that trick which is called\nthe miller's pass.  After this, clapping his right hand flat upon the\nmiddle of the saddle, he gave himself such a jerking swing that he thereby\nseated himself upon the crupper, after the manner of gentlewomen sitting on\nhorseback.  This done, he easily passed his right leg over the saddle, and\nplaced himself like one that rides in croup.  But, said he, it were better\nfor me to get into the saddle; then putting the thumbs of both hands upon\nthe crupper before him, and thereupon leaning himself, as upon the only\nsupporters of his body, he incontinently turned heels over head in the air,\nand straight found himself betwixt the bow of the saddle in a good\nsettlement.  Then with a somersault springing into the air again, he fell\nto stand with both his feet close together upon the saddle, and there made\nabove a hundred frisks, turns, and demipommads, with his arms held out\nacross, and in so doing cried out aloud, I rage, I rage, devils, I am stark\nmad, devils, I am mad, hold me, devils, hold me, hold, devils, hold, hold!\n\nWhilst he was thus vaulting, the rogues in great astonishment said to one\nanother, By cock's death, he is a goblin or a devil thus disguised.  Ab\nhoste maligno libera nos, Domine, and ran away in a full flight, as if they\nhad been routed, looking now and then behind them, like a dog that carrieth\naway a goose-wing in his mouth.  Then Gymnast, spying his advantage,\nalighted from his horse, drew his sword, and laid on great blows upon the\nthickset and highest crested among them, and overthrew them in great heaps,\nhurt, wounded, and bruised, being resisted by nobody, they thinking he had\nbeen a starved devil, as well in regard of his wonderful feats in vaulting,\nwhich they had seen, as for the talk Tripet had with him, calling him poor\ndevil.  Only Tripet would have traitorously cleft his head with his\nhorseman's sword, or lance-knight falchion; but he was well armed, and felt\nnothing of the blow but the weight of the stroke.  Whereupon, turning\nsuddenly about, he gave Tripet a home-thrust, and upon the back of that,\nwhilst he was about to ward his head from a slash, he ran him in at the\nbreast with a hit, which at once cut his stomach, the fifth gut called the\ncolon, and the half of his liver, wherewith he fell to the ground, and in\nfalling gushed forth above four pottles of pottage, and his soul mingled\nwith the pottage.\n\nThis done, Gymnast withdrew himself, very wisely considering that a case of\ngreat adventure and hazard should not be pursued unto its utmost period,\nand that it becomes all cavaliers modestly to use their good fortune,\nwithout troubling or stretching it too far.  Wherefore, getting to horse,\nhe gave him the spur, taking the right way unto Vauguyon, and Prelinguand\nwith him.\n\n\n\n\nHow Gargantua demolished the castle at the ford of Vede, and how they\npassed the ford.\n\nAs soon as he came, he related the estate and condition wherein they had\nfound the enemy, and the stratagem which he alone had used against all\ntheir multitude, affirming that they were but rascally rogues, plunderers,\nthieves, and robbers, ignorant of all military discipline, and that they\nmight boldly set forward unto the field; it being an easy matter to fell\nand strike them down like beasts.  Then Gargantua mounted his great mare,\naccompanied as we have said before, and finding in his way a high and great\ntree, which commonly was called by the name of St. Martin's tree, because\nheretofore St. Martin planted a pilgrim's staff there, which in tract of\ntime grew to that height and greatness, said, This is that which I lacked;\nthis tree shall serve me both for a staff and lance.  With that he pulled\nit up easily, plucked off the boughs, and trimmed it at his pleasure.  In\nthe meantime his mare pissed to ease her belly, but it was in such\nabundance that it did overflow the country seven leagues, and all the piss\nof that urinal flood ran glib away towards the ford of Vede, wherewith the\nwater was so swollen that all the forces the enemy had there were with\ngreat horror drowned, except some who had taken the way on the left hand\ntowards the hills.  Gargantua, being come to the place of the wood of Vede,\nwas informed by Eudemon that there was some remainder of the enemy within\nthe castle, which to know, Gargantua cried out as loud as he was able, Are\nyou there, or are you not there?  If you be there, be there no more; and if\nyou are not there, I have no more to say.  But a ruffian gunner, whose\ncharge was to attend the portcullis over the gate, let fly a cannon-ball at\nhim, and hit him with that shot most furiously on the right temple of his\nhead, yet did him no more hurt than if he had but cast a prune or kernel of\na wine-grape at him.  What is this? said Gargantua; do you throw at us\ngrape-kernels here?  The vintage shall cost you dear; thinking indeed that\nthe bullet had been the kernel of a grape, or raisin-kernel.\n\nThose who were within the castle, being till then busy at the pillage, when\nthey heard this noise ran to the towers and fortresses, from whence they\nshot at him above nine thousand and five-and-twenty falconshot and\narquebusades, aiming all at his head, and so thick did they shoot at him\nthat he cried out, Ponocrates, my friend, these flies here are like to put\nout mine eyes; give me a branch of those willow-trees to drive them away,\nthinking that the bullets and stones shot out of the great ordnance had\nbeen but dunflies.  Ponocrates looked and saw that there were no other\nflies but great shot which they had shot from the castle.  Then was it that\nhe rushed with his great tree against the castle, and with mighty blows\noverthrew both towers and fortresses, and laid all level with the ground,\nby which means all that were within were slain and broken in pieces.  Going\nfrom thence, they came to the bridge at the mill, where they found all the\nford covered with dead bodies, so thick that they had choked up the mill\nand stopped the current of its water, and these were those that were\ndestroyed in the urinal deluge of the mare.  There they were at a stand,\nconsulting how they might pass without hindrance by these dead carcasses.\nBut Gymnast said, If the devils have passed there, I will pass well enough.\nThe devils have passed there, said Eudemon, to carry away the damned souls.\nBy St. Treignan! said Ponocrates, then by necessary consequence he shall\npass there.  Yes, yes, said Gymnastes, or I shall stick in the way.  Then\nsetting spurs to his horse, he passed through freely, his horse not fearing\nnor being anything affrighted at the sight of the dead bodies; for he had\naccustomed him, according to the doctrine of Aelian, not to fear armour,\nnor the carcasses of dead men; and that not by killing men as Diomedes did\nthe Thracians, or as Ulysses did in throwing the corpses of his enemies at\nhis horse's feet, as Homer saith, but by putting a Jack-a-lent amongst his\nhay, and making him go over it ordinarily when he gave him his oats.  The\nother three followed him very close, except Eudemon only, whose horse's\nfore-right or far forefoot sank up to the knee in the paunch of a great fat\nchuff who lay there upon his back drowned, and could not get it out.  There\nwas he pestered, until Gargantua, with the end of his staff, thrust down\nthe rest of the villain's tripes into the water whilst the horse pulled out\nhis foot; and, which is a wonderful thing in hippiatry, the said horse was\nthoroughly cured of a ringbone which he had in that foot by this touch of\nthe burst guts of that great looby.\n\n\n\n\nHow Gargantua, in combing his head, made the great cannon-balls fall out of\nhis hair.\n\nBeing come out of the river of Vede, they came very shortly after to\nGrangousier's castle, who waited for them with great longing.  At their\ncoming they were entertained with many congees, and cherished with\nembraces.  Never was seen a more joyful company, for Supplementum\nSupplementi Chronicorum saith that Gargamelle died there with joy; for my\npart, truly I cannot tell, neither do I care very much for her, nor for\nanybody else.  The truth was, that Gargantua, in shifting his clothes, and\ncombing his head with a comb, which was nine hundred foot long of the\nJewish cane measure, and whereof the teeth were great tusks of elephants,\nwhole and entire, he made fall at every rake above seven balls of bullets,\nat a dozen the ball, that stuck in his hair at the razing of the castle of\nthe wood of Vede.  Which his father Grangousier seeing, thought they had\nbeen lice, and said unto him, What, my dear son, hast thou brought us this\nfar some short-winged hawks of the college of Montague?  I did not mean\nthat thou shouldst reside there.  Then answered Ponocrates, My sovereign\nlord, think not that I have placed him in that lousy college which they\ncall Montague; I had rather have put him amongst the grave-diggers of Sanct\nInnocent, so enormous is the cruelty and villainy that I have known there:\nfor the galley-slaves are far better used amongst the Moors and Tartars,\nthe murderers in the criminal dungeons, yea, the very dogs in your house,\nthan are the poor wretched students in the aforesaid college.  And if I\nwere King of Paris, the devil take me if I would not set it on fire, and\nburn both principal and regents, for suffering this inhumanity to be\nexercised before their eyes.  Then, taking up one of these bullets, he\nsaid, These are cannon-shot, which your son Gargantua hath lately received\nby the treachery of your enemies, as he was passing before the wood of\nVede.\n\nBut they have been so rewarded, that they are all destroyed in the ruin of\nthe castle, as were the Philistines by the policy of Samson, and those whom\nthe tower of Silohim slew, as it is written in the thirteenth of Luke.  My\nopinion is, that we pursue them whilst the luck is on our side; for\noccasion hath all her hair on her forehead; when she is passed, you may not\nrecall her,--she hath no tuft whereby you can lay hold on her, for she is\nbald in the hind-part of her head, and never returneth again.  Truly, said\nGrangousier, it shall not be at this time; for I will make you a feast\nthis night, and bid you welcome.\n\nThis said, they made ready supper, and, of extraordinary besides his daily\nfare, were roasted sixteen oxen, three heifers, two and thirty calves,\nthree score and three fat kids, four score and fifteen wethers, three\nhundred farrow pigs or sheats soused in sweet wine or must, eleven score\npartridges, seven hundred snipes and woodcocks, four hundred Loudun and\nCornwall capons, six thousand pullets, and as many pigeons, six hundred\ncrammed hens, fourteen hundred leverets, or young hares and rabbits, three\nhundred and three buzzards, and one thousand and seven hundred cockerels.\nFor venison, they could not so suddenly come by it, only eleven wild boars,\nwhich the Abbot of Turpenay sent, and eighteen fallow deer which the Lord\nof Gramount bestowed; together with seven score pheasants, which were sent\nby the Lord of Essars; and some dozens of queests, coushats, ringdoves, and\nwoodculvers; river-fowl, teals and awteals, bitterns, courtes, plovers,\nfrancolins, briganders, tyrasons, young lapwings, tame ducks, shovellers,\nwoodlanders, herons, moorhens, criels, storks, canepetiers, oranges,\nflamans, which are phaenicopters, or crimson-winged sea-fowls, terrigoles,\nturkeys, arbens, coots, solan-geese, curlews, termagants, and\nwater-wagtails, with a great deal of cream, curds, and fresh cheese, and\nstore of soup, pottages, and brewis with great variety.  Without doubt there\nwas meat enough, and it was handsomely dressed by Snapsauce, Hotchpot, and\nBrayverjuice, Grangousier's cooks.  Jenkin Trudgeapace and Cleanglass were\nvery careful to fill them drink.\n\n\n\n\nHow Gargantua did eat up six pilgrims in a salad.\n\nThe story requireth that we relate that which happened unto six pilgrims\nwho came from Sebastian near to Nantes, and who for shelter that night,\nbeing afraid of the enemy, had hid themselves in the garden upon the\nchichling peas, among the cabbages and lettuces.  Gargantua finding himself\nsomewhat dry, asked whether they could get any lettuce to make him a salad;\nand hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the country, for\nthey were as great as plum-trees or as walnut-trees, he would go thither\nhimself, and brought thence in his hand what he thought good, and withal\ncarried away the six pilgrims, who were in so great fear that they did not\ndare to speak nor cough.\n\nWashing them, therefore, first at the fountain, the pilgrims said one to\nanother softly, What shall we do?  We are almost drowned here amongst these\nlettuce, shall we speak?  But if we speak, he will kill us for spies.  And,\nas they were thus deliberating what to do, Gargantua put them with the\nlettuce into a platter of the house, as large as the huge tun of the White\nFriars of the Cistercian order; which done, with oil, vinegar, and salt, he\nate them up, to refresh himself a little before supper, and had already\nswallowed up five of the pilgrims, the sixth being in the platter, totally\nhid under a lettuce, except his bourdon or staff that appeared, and nothing\nelse.  Which Grangousier seeing, said to Gargantua, I think that is the\nhorn of a shell-snail, do not eat it.  Why not? said Gargantua, they are\ngood all this month:  which he no sooner said, but, drawing up the staff,\nand therewith taking up the pilgrim, he ate him very well, then drank a\nterrible draught of excellent white wine.  The pilgrims, thus devoured,\nmade shift to save themselves as well as they could, by withdrawing their\nbodies out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth, but could not escape\nfrom thinking they had been put in the lowest dungeon of a prison.  And\nwhen Gargantua whiffed the great draught, they thought to have been drowned\nin his mouth, and the flood of wine had almost carried them away into the\ngulf of his stomach.  Nevertheless, skipping with their bourdons, as St.\nMichael's palmers use to do, they sheltered themselves from the danger of\nthat inundation under the banks of his teeth.  But one of them by chance,\ngroping or sounding the country with his staff, to try whether they were in\nsafety or no, struck hard against the cleft of a hollow tooth, and hit the\nmandibulary sinew or nerve of the jaw, which put Gargantua to very great\npain, so that he began to cry for the rage that he felt.  To ease himself\ntherefore of his smarting ache, he called for his toothpicker, and rubbing\ntowards a young walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, unnestled you my\ngentlemen pilgrims.\n\nFor he caught one by the legs, another by the scrip, another by the pocket,\nanother by the scarf, another by the band of the breeches, and the poor\nfellow that had hurt him with the bourdon, him he hooked to him by the\ncodpiece, which snatch nevertheless did him a great deal of good, for it\npierced unto him a pocky botch he had in the groin, which grievously\ntormented him ever since they were past Ancenis.  The pilgrims, thus\ndislodged, ran away athwart the plain a pretty fast pace, and the pain\nceased, even just at the time when by Eudemon he was called to supper, for\nall was ready.  I will go then, said he, and piss away my misfortune; which\nhe did do in such a copious measure, that the urine taking away the feet\nfrom the pilgrims, they were carried along with the stream unto the bank of\na tuft of trees.  Upon which, as soon as they had taken footing, and that\nfor their self-preservation they had run a little out of the road, they on\na sudden fell all six, except Fourniller, into a trap that had been made to\ntake wolves by a train, out of which, nevertheless, they escaped by the\nindustry of the said Fourniller, who broke all the snares and ropes.  Being\ngone from thence, they lay all the rest of that night in a lodge near unto\nCoudray, where they were comforted in their miseries by the gracious words\nof one of their company, called Sweer-to-go, who showed them that this\nadventure had been foretold by the prophet David, Psalm.  Quum exsurgerent\nhomines in nos, forte vivos deglutissent nos; when we were eaten in the\nsalad, with salt, oil, and vinegar.  Quum irasceretur furor eorum in nos,\nforsitan aqua absorbuisset nos; when he drank the great draught.  Torrentem\npertransivit anima nostra; when the stream of his water carried us to the\nthicket.  Forsitan pertransisset anima nostra aquam intolerabilem; that is,\nthe water of his urine, the flood whereof, cutting our way, took our feet\nfrom us.  Benedictus Dominus qui non dedit nos in captionem dentibus eorum.\nAnima nostra sicut passer erepta est de laqueo venantium; when we fell in\nthe trap.  Laqueus contritus est, by Fourniller, et nos liberati sumus.\nAdjutorium nostrum, &c.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Monk was feasted by Gargantua, and of the jovial discourse they had\nat supper.\n\nWhen Gargantua was set down at table, after all of them had somewhat stayed\ntheir stomachs by a snatch or two of the first bits eaten heartily,\nGrangousier began to relate the source and cause of the war raised between\nhim and Picrochole; and came to tell how Friar John of the Funnels had\ntriumphed at the defence of the close of the abbey, and extolled him for\nhis valour above Camillus, Scipio, Pompey, Caesar, and Themistocles.  Then\nGargantua desired that he might be presently sent for, to the end that with\nhim they might consult of what was to be done.  Whereupon, by a joint\nconsent, his steward went for him, and brought him along merrily, with his\nstaff of the cross, upon Grangousier's mule.  When he was come, a thousand\nhuggings, a thousand embracements, a thousand good days were given.  Ha,\nFriar John, my friend Friar John, my brave cousin Friar John from the\ndevil!  Let me clip thee, my heart, about the neck; to me an armful.  I\nmust grip thee, my ballock, till thy back crack with it.  Come, my cod, let\nme coll thee till I kill thee.  And Friar John, the gladdest man in the\nworld, never was man made welcomer, never was any more courteously and\ngraciously received than Friar John.  Come, come, said Gargantua, a stool\nhere close by me at this end.  I am content, said the monk, seeing you will\nhave it so.  Some water, page; fill, my boy, fill; it is to refresh my\nliver.  Give me some, child, to gargle my throat withal.  Deposita cappa,\nsaid Gymnast, let us pull off this frock.  Ho, by G--, gentlemen, said the\nmonk, there is a chapter in Statutis Ordinis which opposeth my laying of it\ndown.  Pish! said Gymnast, a fig for your chapter!  This frock breaks both\nyour shoulders, put it off.  My friend, said the monk, let me alone with\nit; for, by G--, I'll drink the better that it is on.  It makes all my body\njocund.  If I should lay it aside, the waggish pages would cut to\nthemselves garters out of it, as I was once served at Coulaines.  And,\nwhich is worse, I shall lose my appetite.  But if in this habit I sit down\nat table, I will drink, by G--, both to thee and to thy horse, and so\ncourage, frolic, God save the company!  I have already supped, yet will I\neat never a whit the less for that; for I have a paved stomach, as hollow\nas a butt of malvoisie or St. Benedictus' boot (butt), and always open like\na lawyer's pouch.  Of all fishes but the tench take the wing of a partridge\nor the thigh of a nun.  Doth not he die like a good fellow that dies with a\nstiff catso?  Our prior loves exceedingly the white of a capon.  In that,\nsaid Gymnast, he doth not resemble the foxes; for of the capons, hens, and\npullets which they carry away they never eat the white.  Why? said the\nmonk.  Because, said Gymnast, they have no cooks to dress them; and, if\nthey be not competently made ready, they remain red and not white; the\nredness of meats being a token that they have not got enough of the fire,\nwhether by boiling, roasting, or otherwise, except the shrimps, lobsters,\ncrabs, and crayfishes, which are cardinalized with boiling.  By God's\nfeast-gazers, said the monk, the porter of our abbey then hath not his head\nwell boiled, for his eyes are as red as a mazer made of an alder-tree.  The\nthigh of this leveret is good for those that have the gout.  To the purpose\nof the truel,--what is the reason that the thighs of a gentlewoman are\nalways fresh and cool?  This problem, said Gargantua, is neither in\nAristotle, in Alexander Aphrodiseus, nor in Plutarch.  There are three\ncauses, said the monk, by which that place is naturally refreshed.  Primo,\nbecause the water runs all along by it.  Secundo, because it is a shady\nplace, obscure and dark, upon which the sun never shines.  And thirdly,\nbecause it is continually flabbelled, blown upon, and aired by the north\nwinds of the hole arstick, the fan of the smock, and flipflap of the\ncodpiece.  And lusty, my lads.  Some bousing liquor, page!  So! crack,\ncrack, crack.  O how good is God, that gives us of this excellent juice!  I\ncall him to witness, if I had been in the time of Jesus Christ, I would\nhave kept him from being taken by the Jews in the garden of Olivet.  And\nthe devil fail me, if I should have failed to cut off the hams of these\ngentlemen apostles who ran away so basely after they had well supped, and\nleft their good master in the lurch.  I hate that man worse than poison\nthat offers to run away when he should fight and lay stoutly about him.  Oh\nthat I were but King of France for fourscore or a hundred years!  By G--, I\nshould whip like curtail-dogs these runaways of Pavia.  A plague take them;\nwhy did they not choose rather to die there than to leave their good prince\nin that pinch and necessity?  Is it not better and more honourable to\nperish in fighting valiantly than to live in disgrace by a cowardly running\naway?  We are like to eat no great store of goslings this year; therefore,\nfriend, reach me some of that roasted pig there.\n\nDiavolo, is there no more must?  No more sweet wine?  Germinavit radix\nJesse.  Je renie ma vie, je meurs de soif; I renounce my life, I rage for\nthirst.  This wine is none of the worst.  What wine drink you at Paris?  I\ngive myself to the devil, if I did not once keep open house at Paris for\nall comers six months together.  Do you know Friar Claude of the high\nkilderkins?  Oh the good fellow that he is!  But I do not know what fly\nhath stung him of late, he is become so hard a student.  For my part, I\nstudy not at all.  In our abbey we never study for fear of the mumps, which\ndisease in horses is called the mourning in the chine.  Our late abbot was\nwont to say that it is a monstrous thing to see a learned monk.  By G--,\nmaster, my friend, Magis magnos clericos non sunt magis magnos sapientes.\nYou never saw so many hares as there are this year.  I could not anywhere\ncome by a goshawk nor tassel of falcon.  My Lord Belloniere promised me a\nlanner, but he wrote to me not long ago that he was become pursy.  The\npartridges will so multiply henceforth, that they will go near to eat up\nour ears.  I take no delight in the stalking-horse, for I catch such cold\nthat I am like to founder myself at that sport.  If I do not run, toil,\ntravel, and trot about, I am not well at ease.  True it is that in leaping\nover the hedges and bushes my frock leaves always some of its wool behind\nit.  I have recovered a dainty greyhound; I give him to the devil, if he\nsuffer a hare to escape him.  A groom was leading him to my Lord\nHuntlittle, and I robbed him of him.  Did I ill?  No, Friar John, said\nGymnast, no, by all the devils that are, no!  So, said the monk, do I\nattest these same devils so long as they last, or rather, virtue (of) G--,\nwhat could that gouty limpard have done with so fine a dog?  By the body of\nG--, he is better pleased when one presents him with a good yoke of oxen.\nHow now, said Ponocrates, you swear, Friar John.  It is only, said the\nmonk, but to grace and adorn my speech.  They are colours of a Ciceronian\nrhetoric.\n\n\n\n\nWhy monks are the outcasts of the world; and wherefore some have bigger\nnoses than others.\n\nBy the faith of a Christian, said Eudemon, I do wonderfully dote and enter\nin a great ecstasy when I consider the honesty and good fellowship of this\nmonk, for he makes us here all merry.  How is it, then, that they exclude\nthe monks from all good companies, calling them feast-troublers, marrers of\nmirth, and disturbers of all civil conversation, as the bees drive away the\ndrones from their hives?  Ignavum fucos pecus, said Maro, a praesepibus\narcent.  Hereunto, answered Gargantua, there is nothing so true as that the\nfrock and cowl draw unto itself the opprobries, injuries, and maledictions\nof the world, just as the wind called Cecias attracts the clouds.  The\nperemptory reason is, because they eat the ordure and excrements of the\nworld, that is to say, the sins of the people, and, like dung-chewers and\nexcrementitious eaters, they are cast into the privies and secessive\nplaces, that is, the convents and abbeys, separated from political\nconversation, as the jakes and retreats of a house are.  But if you\nconceive how an ape in a family is always mocked and provokingly incensed,\nyou shall easily apprehend how monks are shunned of all men, both young and\nold.  The ape keeps not the house as a dog doth, he draws not in the plough\nas the ox, he yields neither milk nor wool as the sheep, he carrieth no\nburden as a horse doth.  That which he doth, is only to conskite, spoil,\nand defile all, which is the cause wherefore he hath of all men mocks,\nfrumperies, and bastinadoes.\n\nAfter the same manner a monk--I mean those lither, idle, lazy monks--doth\nnot labour and work, as do the peasant and artificer; doth not ward and\ndefend the country, as doth the man of war; cureth not the sick and\ndiseased, as the physician doth; doth neither preach nor teach, as do the\nevangelical doctors and schoolmasters; doth not import commodities and\nthings necessary for the commonwealth, as the merchant doth.  Therefore is\nit that by and of all men they are hooted at, hated, and abhorred.  Yea,\nbut, said Grangousier, they pray to God for us.  Nothing less, answered\nGargantua.  True it is, that with a tingle tangle jangling of bells they\ntrouble and disquiet all their neighbours about them.  Right, said the\nmonk; a mass, a matin, a vesper well rung, are half said.  They mumble out\ngreat store of legends and psalms, by them not at all understood; they say\nmany paternosters interlarded with Ave-Maries, without thinking upon or\napprehending the meaning of what it is they say, which truly I call mocking\nof God, and not prayers.  But so help them God, as they pray for us, and\nnot for being afraid to lose their victuals, their manchots, and good fat\npottage.  All true Christians, of all estates and conditions, in all places\nand at all times, send up their prayers to God, and the Mediator prayeth\nand intercedeth for them, and God is gracious to them.  Now such a one is\nour good Friar John; therefore every man desireth to have him in his\ncompany.  He is no bigot or hypocrite; he is not torn and divided betwixt\nreality and appearance; no wretch of a rugged and peevish disposition, but\nhonest, jovial, resolute, and a good fellow.  He travels, he labours, he\ndefends the oppressed, comforts the afflicted, helps the needy, and keeps\nthe close of the abbey.  Nay, said the monk, I do a great deal more than\nthat; for whilst we are in despatching our matins and anniversaries in the\nchoir, I make withal some crossbow-strings, polish glass bottles and bolts,\nI twist lines and weave purse nets wherein to catch coneys.  I am never\nidle.  But now, hither come, some drink, some drink here!  Bring the fruit.\nThese chestnuts are of the wood of Estrox, and with good new wine are able\nto make you a fine cracker and composer of bum-sonnets.  You are not as\nyet, it seems, well moistened in this house with the sweet wine and must.\nBy G--, I drink to all men freely, and at all fords, like a proctor or\npromoter's horse.  Friar John, said Gymnast, take away the snot that hangs\nat your nose.  Ha, ha, said the monk, am not I in danger of drowning,\nseeing I am in water even to the nose?  No, no, Quare?  Quia, though some\nwater come out from thence, there never goes in any; for it is well\nantidoted with pot-proof armour and syrup of the vine-leaf.\n\nOh, my friend, he that hath winter-boots made of such leather may boldly\nfish for oysters, for they will never take water.  What is the cause, said\nGargantua, that Friar John hath such a fair nose?  Because, said\nGrangousier, that God would have it so, who frameth us in such form and for\nsuch end as is most agreeable with his divine will, even as a potter\nfashioneth his vessels.  Because, said Ponocrates, he came with the first\nto the fair of noses, and therefore made choice of the fairest and the\ngreatest.  Pish, said the monk, that is not the reason of it, but,\naccording to the true monastical philosophy, it is because my nurse had\nsoft teats, by virtue whereof, whilst she gave me suck, my nose did sink in\nas in so much butter.  The hard breasts of nurses make children\nshort-nosed.  But hey, gay, Ad formam nasi cognoscitur ad te levavi.  I\nnever eat any confections, page, whilst I am at the bibbery.  Item, bring\nme rather some toasts.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Monk made Gargantua sleep, and of his hours and breviaries.\n\nSupper being ended, they consulted of the business in hand, and concluded\nthat about midnight they should fall unawares upon the enemy, to know what\nmanner of watch and ward they kept, and that in the meanwhile they should\ntake a little rest the better to refresh themselves.  But Gargantua could\nnot sleep by any means, on which side soever he turned himself.  Whereupon\nthe monk said to him, I never sleep soundly but when I am at sermon or\nprayers.  Let us therefore begin, you and I, the seven penitential psalms,\nto try whether you shall not quickly fall asleep.  The conceit pleased\nGargantua very well, and, beginning the first of these psalms, as soon as\nthey came to the words Beati quorum they fell asleep, both the one and the\nother.  But the monk, for his being formerly accustomed to the hour of\nclaustral matins, failed not to awake a little before midnight, and, being\nup himself, awaked all the rest, in singing aloud, and with a full clear\nvoice, the song:\n\n  Awake, O Reinian, ho, awake!\n    Awake, O Reinian, ho!\n  Get up, you no more sleep must take;\n    Get up, for we must go.\n\nWhen they were all roused and up, he said, My masters, it is a usual\nsaying, that we begin matins with coughing and supper with drinking.  Let\nus now, in doing clean contrarily, begin our matins with drinking, and at\nnight before supper we shall cough as hard as we can.  What, said\nGargantua, to drink so soon after sleep?  This is not to live according to\nthe diet and prescript rule of the physicians, for you ought first to scour\nand cleanse your stomach of all its superfluities and excrements.  Oh, well\nphysicked, said the monk; a hundred devils leap into my body, if there be\nnot more old drunkards than old physicians!  I have made this paction and\ncovenant with my appetite, that it always lieth down and goes to bed with\nmyself, for to that I every day give very good order; then the next morning\nit also riseth with me and gets up when I am awake.  Mind you your charges,\ngentlemen, or tend your cures as much as you will.  I will get me to my\ndrawer; in terms of falconry, my tiring.  What drawer or tiring do you\nmean? said Gargantua.  My breviary, said the monk, for just as the\nfalconers, before they feed their hawks, do make them draw at a hen's leg\nto purge their brains of phlegm and sharpen them to a good appetite, so, by\ntaking this merry little breviary in the morning, I scour all my lungs and\nam presently ready to drink.\n\nAfter what manner, said Gargantua, do you say these fair hours and prayers\nof yours?  After the manner of Whipfield (Fessecamp, and corruptly Fecan.),\nsaid the monk, by three psalms and three lessons, or nothing at all, he\nthat will.  I never tie myself to hours, prayers, and sacraments; for they\nare made for the man and not the man for them.  Therefore is it that I make\nmy prayers in fashion of stirrup-leathers; I shorten or lengthen them when\nI think good.  Brevis oratio penetrat caelos et longa potatio evacuat\nscyphos.  Where is that written?  By my faith, said Ponocrates, I cannot\ntell, my pillicock, but thou art more worth than gold.  Therein, said the\nmonk, I am like you; but, venite, apotemus.  Then made they ready store of\ncarbonadoes, or rashers on the coals, and good fat soups, or brewis with\nsippets; and the monk drank what he pleased.  Some kept him company, and\nthe rest did forbear, for their stomachs were not as yet opened.\nAfterwards every man began to arm and befit himself for the field. And they\narmed the monk against his will; for he desired no other armour for back\nand breast but his frock, nor any other weapon in his hand but the staff of\nthe cross.  Yet at their pleasure was he completely armed cap-a-pie, and\nmounted upon one of the best horses in the kingdom, with a good slashing\nshable by his side, together with Gargantua, Ponocrates, Gymnast, Eudemon,\nand five-and-twenty more of the most resolute and adventurous of\nGrangousier's house, all armed at proof with their lances in their hands,\nmounted like St. George, and everyone of them having an arquebusier behind\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Monk encouraged his fellow-champions, and how he hanged upon a\ntree.\n\nThus went out those valiant champions on their adventure, in full\nresolution to know what enterprise they should undertake, and what to take\nheed of and look well to in the day of the great and horrible battle.  And\nthe monk encouraged them, saying, My children, do not fear nor doubt, I\nwill conduct you safely.  God and Sanct Benedict be with us!  If I had\nstrength answerable to my courage, by's death, I would plume them for you\nlike ducks.  I fear nothing but the great ordnance; yet I know of a charm\nby way of prayer, which the subsexton of our abbey taught me, that will\npreserve a man from the violence of guns and all manner of fire-weapons and\nengines; but it will do me no good, because I do not believe it.\nNevertheless, I hope my staff of the cross shall this day play devilish\npranks amongst them.  By G--, whoever of our party shall offer to play the\nduck, and shrink when blows are a-dealing, I give myself to the devil, if I\ndo not make a monk of him in my stead, and hamper him within my frock,\nwhich is a sovereign cure against cowardice.  Did you never hear of my Lord\nMeurles his greyhound, which was not worth a straw in the fields?  He put a\nfrock about his neck:  by the body of G--, there was neither hare nor fox\nthat could escape him, and, which is more, he lined all the bitches in the\ncountry, though before that he was feeble-reined and ex frigidis et\nmaleficiatis.\n\nThe monk uttering these words in choler, as he passed under a walnut-tree,\nin his way towards the causey, he broached the vizor of his helmet on the\nstump of a great branch of the said tree.  Nevertheless, he set his spurs\nso fiercely to the horse, who was full of mettle and quick on the spur,\nthat he bounded forwards, and the monk going about to ungrapple his vizor,\nlet go his hold of the bridle, and so hanged by his hand upon the bough,\nwhilst his horse stole away from under him.  By this means was the monk\nleft hanging on the walnut-tree, and crying for help, murder, murder,\nswearing also that he was betrayed.  Eudemon perceived him first, and\ncalling Gargantua said, Sir, come and see Absalom hanging.  Gargantua,\nbeing come, considered the countenance of the monk, and in what posture he\nhanged; wherefore he said to Eudemon, You were mistaken in comparing him to\nAbsalom; for Absalom hung by his hair, but this shaveling monk hangeth by\nthe ears.  Help me, said the monk, in the devil's name; is this a time for\nyou to prate?  You seem to me to be like the decretalist preachers, who say\nthat whosoever shall see his neighbour in the danger of death, ought, upon\npain of trisulk excommunication, rather choose to admonish him to make his\nconfession to a priest, and put his conscience in the state of peace, than\notherwise to help and relieve him.\n\nAnd therefore when I shall see them fallen into a river, and ready to be\ndrowned, I shall make them a fair long sermon de contemptu mundi, et fuga\nseculi; and when they are stark dead, shall then go to their aid and\nsuccour in fishing after them.  Be quiet, said Gymnast, and stir not, my\nminion.  I am now coming to unhang thee and to set thee at freedom, for\nthou art a pretty little gentle monachus.  Monachus in claustro non valet\nova duo; sed quando est extra, bene valet triginta.  I have seen above five\nhundred hanged, but I never saw any have a better countenance in his\ndangling and pendilatory swagging.  Truly, if I had so good a one, I would\nwillingly hang thus all my lifetime.  What, said the monk, have you almost\ndone preaching?  Help me, in the name of God, seeing you will not in the\nname of the other spirit, or, by the habit which I wear, you shall repent\nit, tempore et loco praelibatis.\n\nThen Gymnast alighted from his horse, and, climbing up the walnut-tree,\nlifted up the monk with one hand by the gussets of his armour under the\narmpits, and with the other undid his vizor from the stump of the broken\nbranch; which done, he let him fall to the ground and himself after.  As\nsoon as the monk was down, he put off all his armour, and threw away one\npiece after another about the field, and, taking to him again his staff of\nthe cross, remounted up to his horse, which Eudemon had caught in his\nrunning away.  Then went they on merrily, riding along on the highway.\n\n\n\n\nHow the scouts and fore-party of Picrochole were met with by Gargantua, and\nhow the Monk slew Captain Drawforth (Tirevant.), and then was taken\nprisoner by his enemies.\n\nPicrochole, at the relation of those who had escaped out of the broil and\ndefeat wherein Tripet was untriped, grew very angry that the devils should\nhave so run upon his men, and held all that night a counsel of war, at\nwhich Rashcalf and Touchfaucet (Hastiveau, Touquedillon.), concluded his\npower to be such that he was able to defeat all the devils of hell if they\nshould come to jostle with his forces.  This Picrochole did not fully\nbelieve, though he doubted not much of it.  Therefore sent he under the\ncommand and conduct of the Count Drawforth, for discovering of the country,\nthe number of sixteen hundred horsemen, all well mounted upon light horses\nfor skirmish and thoroughly besprinkled with holy water; and everyone for\ntheir field-mark or cognizance had the sign of a star in his scarf, to\nserve at all adventures in case they should happen to encounter with\ndevils, that by the virtue, as well of that Gregorian water as of the stars\nwhich they wore, they might make them disappear and evanish.\n\nIn this equipage they made an excursion upon the country till they came\nnear to the Vauguyon, which is the valley of Guyon, and to the spital, but\ncould never find anybody to speak unto; whereupon they returned a little\nback, and took occasion to pass above the aforesaid hospital to try what\nintelligence they could come by in those parts.  In which resolution riding\non, and by chance in a pastoral lodge or shepherd's cottage near to Coudray\nhitting upon the five pilgrims, they carried them way-bound and manacled,\nas if they had been spies, for all the exclamations, adjurations, and\nrequests that they could make.  Being come down from thence towards\nSeville, they were heard by Gargantua, who said then unto those that were\nwith him, Comrades and fellow-soldiers, we have here met with an encounter,\nand they are ten times in number more than we.  Shall we charge them or no?\nWhat a devil, said the monk, shall we do else?  Do you esteem men by their\nnumber rather than by their valour and prowess?  With this he cried out,\nCharge, devils, charge!  Which when the enemies heard, they thought\ncertainly that they had been very devils, and therefore even then began all\nof them to run away as hard as they could drive, Drawforth only excepted,\nwho immediately settled his lance on its rest, and therewith hit the monk\nwith all his force on the very middle of his breast, but, coming against\nhis horrific frock, the point of the iron being with the blow either broke\noff or blunted, it was in matter of execution as if you had struck against\nan anvil with a little wax-candle.\n\nThen did the monk with his staff of the cross give him such a sturdy thump\nand whirret betwixt his neck and shoulders, upon the acromion bone, that he\nmade him lose both sense and motion and fall down stone dead at his horse's\nfeet; and, seeing the sign of the star which he wore scarfwise, he said\nunto Gargantua, These men are but priests, which is but the beginning of a\nmonk; by St. John, I am a perfect monk, I will kill them to you like flies.\nThen ran he after them at a swift and full gallop till he overtook the\nrear, and felled them down like tree-leaves, striking athwart and alongst\nand every way.  Gymnast presently asked Gargantua if they should pursue\nthem.  To whom Gargantua answered, By no means; for, according to right\nmilitary discipline, you must never drive your enemy unto despair, for that\nsuch a strait doth multiply his force and increase his courage, which was\nbefore broken and cast down; neither is there any better help or outrage of\nrelief for men that are amazed, out of heart, toiled, and spent, than to\nhope for no favour at all.  How many victories have been taken out of the\nhands of the victors by the vanquished, when they would not rest satisfied\nwith reason, but attempt to put all to the sword, and totally to destroy\ntheir enemies, without leaving so much as one to carry home news of the\ndefeat of his fellows.  Open, therefore, unto your enemies all the gates\nand ways, and make to them a bridge of silver rather than fail, that you\nmay be rid of them.  Yea, but, said Gymnast, they have the monk.  Have they\nthe monk? said Gargantua.  Upon mine honour, then, it will prove to their\ncost.  But to prevent all dangers, let us not yet retreat, but halt here\nquietly as in an ambush; for I think I do already understand the policy and\njudgment of our enemies.  They are truly more directed by chance and mere\nfortune than by good advice and counsel.  In the meanwhile, whilst these\nmade a stop under the walnut-trees, the monk pursued on the chase, charging\nall he overtook, and giving quarter to none, until he met with a trooper\nwho carried behind him one of the poor pilgrims, and there would have\nrifled him.  The pilgrim, in hope of relief at the sight of the monk, cried\nout, Ha, my lord prior, my good friend, my lord prior, save me, I beseech\nyou, save me!  Which words being heard by those that rode in the van, they\ninstantly faced about, and seeing there was nobody but the monk that made\nthis great havoc and slaughter among them, they loaded him with blows as\nthick as they use to do an ass with wood.  But of all this he felt nothing,\nespecially when they struck upon his frock, his skin was so hard.  Then\nthey committed him to two of the marshal's men to keep, and, looking about,\nsaw nobody coming against them, whereupon they thought that Gargantua and\nhis party were fled.  Then was it that they rode as hard as they could\ntowards the walnut-trees to meet with them, and left the monk there all\nalone, with his two foresaid men to guard him.  Gargantua heard the noise\nand neighing of the horses, and said to his men, Comrades, I hear the track\nand beating of the enemy's horse-feet, and withal perceive that some of\nthem come in a troop and full body against us.  Let us rally and close\nhere, then set forward in order, and by this means we shall be able to\nreceive their charge to their loss and our honour.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Monk rid himself of his keepers, and how Picrochole's forlorn hope\nwas defeated.\n\nThe monk, seeing them break off thus without order, conjectured that they\nwere to set upon Gargantua and those that were with him, and was\nwonderfully grieved that he could not succour them.  Then considered he the\ncountenance of the two keepers in whose custody he was, who would have\nwillingly run after the troops to get some booty and plunder, and were\nalways looking towards the valley unto which they were going.  Farther, he\nsyllogized, saying, These men are but badly skilled in matters of war, for\nthey have not required my parole, neither have they taken my sword from me.\nSuddenly hereafter he drew his brackmard or horseman's sword, wherewith he\ngave the keeper which held him on the right side such a sound slash that he\ncut clean through the jugulary veins and the sphagitid or transparent\narteries of the neck, with the fore-part of the throat called the\ngargareon, even unto the two adenes, which are throat kernels; and,\nredoubling the blow, he opened the spinal marrow betwixt the second and\nthird vertebrae.  There fell down that keeper stark dead to the ground.\nThen the monk, reining his horse to the left, ran upon the other, who,\nseeing his fellow dead, and the monk to have the advantage of him, cried\nwith a loud voice, Ha, my lord prior, quarter; I yield, my lord prior,\nquarter; quarter, my good friend, my lord prior.  And the monk cried\nlikewise, My lord posterior, my friend, my lord posterior, you shall have\nit upon your posteriorums.  Ha, said the keeper, my lord prior, my minion,\nmy gentle lord prior, I pray God make you an abbot.  By the habit, said the\nmonk, which I wear, I will here make you a cardinal.  What! do you use to\npay ransoms to religious men?  You shall therefore have by-and-by a red hat\nof my giving.  And the fellow cried, Ha, my lord prior, my lord prior, my\nlord abbot that shall be, my lord cardinal, my lord all!  Ha, ha, hes, no,\nmy lord prior, my good little lord the prior, I yield, render and deliver\nmyself up to you.  And I deliver thee, said the monk, to all the devils in\nhell.  Then at one stroke he cut off his head, cutting his scalp upon the\ntemple-bones, and lifting up in the upper part of the skull the two\ntriangulary bones called sincipital, or the two bones bregmatis, together\nwith the sagittal commissure or dartlike seam which distinguisheth the\nright side of the head from the left, as also a great part of the coronal\nor forehead bone, by which terrible blow likewise he cut the two meninges\nor films which enwrap the brain, and made a deep wound in the brain's two\nposterior ventricles, and the cranium or skull abode hanging upon his\nshoulders by the skin of the pericranium behind, in form of a doctor's\nbonnet, black without and red within.  Thus fell he down also to the ground\nstark dead.\n\nAnd presently the monk gave his horse the spur, and kept the way that the\nenemy held, who had met with Gargantua and his companions in the broad\nhighway, and were so diminished of their number for the enormous slaughter\nthat Gargantua had made with his great tree amongst them, as also Gymnast,\nPonocrates, Eudemon, and the rest, that they began to retreat disorderly\nand in great haste, as men altogether affrighted and troubled in both sense\nand understanding, and as if they had seen the very proper species and form\nof death before their eyes; or rather, as when you see an ass with a brizze\nor gadbee under his tail, or fly that stings him, run hither and thither\nwithout keeping any path or way, throwing down his load to the ground,\nbreaking his bridle and reins, and taking no breath nor rest, and no man\ncan tell what ails him, for they see not anything touch him.  So fled these\npeople destitute of wit, without knowing any cause of flying, only pursued\nby a panic terror which in their minds they had conceived.  The monk,\nperceiving that their whole intent was to betake themselves to their heels,\nalighted from his horse and got upon a big large rock which was in the way,\nand with his great brackmard sword laid such load upon those runaways, and\nwith main strength fetching a compass with his arm without feigning or\nsparing, slew and overthrew so many that his sword broke in two pieces.\nThen thought he within himself that he had slain and killed sufficiently,\nand that the rest should escape to carry news.  Therefore he took up a\nbattle-axe of those that lay there dead, and got upon the rock again,\npassing his time to see the enemy thus flying and to tumble himself amongst\nthe dead bodies, only that he suffered none to carry pike, sword, lance,\nnor gun with him, and those who carried the pilgrims bound he made to\nalight, and gave their horses unto the said pilgrims, keeping them there\nwith him under the hedge, and also Touchfaucet, who was then his prisoner.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Monk carried along with him the Pilgrims, and of the good words\nthat Grangousier gave them.\n\nThis skirmish being ended, Gargantua retreated with his men, excepting the\nmonk, and about the dawning of the day they came unto Grangousier, who in\nhis bed was praying unto God for their safety and victory.  And seeing them\nall safe and sound, he embraced them lovingly, and asked what was become of\nthe monk.  Gargantua answered him that without doubt the enemies had the\nmonk.  Then have they mischief and ill luck, said Grangousier; which was\nvery true.  Therefore is it a common proverb to this day, to give a man the\nmonk, or, as in French, lui bailler le moine, when they would express the\ndoing unto one a mischief.  Then commanded he a good breakfast to be\nprovided for their refreshment.  When all was ready, they called Gargantua,\nbut he was so aggrieved that the monk was not to be heard of that he would\nneither eat nor drink.  In the meanwhile the monk comes, and from the gate\nof the outer court cries out aloud, Fresh wine, fresh wine, Gymnast my\nfriend!  Gymnast went out and saw that it was Friar John, who brought along\nwith him five pilgrims and Touchfaucet prisoners; whereupon Gargantua\nlikewise went forth to meet him, and all of them made him the best welcome\nthat possibly they could, and brought him before Grangousier, who asked him\nof all his adventures.  The monk told him all, both how he was taken, how\nhe rid himself of his keepers, of the slaughter he had made by the way, and\nhow he had rescued the pilgrims and brought along with him Captain\nTouchfaucet.  Then did they altogether fall to banqueting most merrily.  In\nthe meantime Grangousier asked the pilgrims what countrymen they were,\nwhence they came, and whither they went.  Sweer-to-go in the name of the\nrest answered, My sovereign lord, I am of Saint Genou in Berry, this man is\nof Palvau, this other is of Onzay, this of Argy, this of St. Nazarand, and\nthis man of Villebrenin.  We come from Saint Sebastian near Nantes, and are\nnow returning, as we best may, by easy journeys.  Yea, but, said\nGrangousier, what went you to do at Saint Sebastian?  We went, said\nSweer-to-go, to offer up unto that sanct our vows against the plague.  Ah,\npoor men! said Grangousier, do you think that the plague comes from Saint\nSebastian?  Yes, truly, answered Sweer-to-go, our preachers tell us so\nindeed.  But is it so, said Grangousier, do the false prophets teach you\nsuch abuses?  Do they thus blaspheme the sancts and holy men of God, as to\nmake them like unto the devils, who do nothing but hurt unto mankind,--as\nHomer writeth, that the plague was sent into the camp of the Greeks by\nApollo, and as the poets feign a great rabble of Vejoves and mischievous\ngods.  So did a certain cafard or dissembling religionary preach at Sinay,\nthat Saint Anthony sent the fire into men's legs, that Saint Eutropius made\nmen hydropic, Saint Clidas, fools, and that Saint Genou made them goutish.\nBut I punished him so exemplarily, though he called me heretic for it, that\nsince that time no such hypocritical rogue durst set his foot within my\nterritories.  And truly I wonder that your king should suffer them in their\nsermons to publish such scandalous doctrine in his dominions; for they\ndeserve to be chastised with greater severity than those who, by magical\nart, or any other device, have brought the pestilence into a country.  The\npest killeth but the bodies, but such abominable imposters empoison our\nvery souls.  As he spake these words, in came the monk very resolute, and\nasked them, Whence are you, you poor wretches?  Of Saint Genou, said they.\nAnd how, said the monk, does the Abbot Gulligut, the good drinker,--and the\nmonks, what cheer make they?  By G-- body, they'll have a fling at your\nwives, and breast them to some purpose, whilst you are upon your roaming\nrant and gadding pilgrimage.  Hin, hen, said Sweer-to-go, I am not afraid\nof mine, for he that shall see her by day will never break his neck to come\nto her in the night-time.  Yea, marry, said the monk, now you have hit it.\nLet her be as ugly as ever was Proserpina, she will once, by the Lord G--,\nbe overturned, and get her skin-coat shaken, if there dwell any monks near\nto her; for a good carpenter will make use of any kind of timber.  Let me\nbe peppered with the pox, if you find not all your wives with child at your\nreturn; for the very shadow of the steeple of an abbey is fruitful.  It is,\nsaid Gargantua, like the water of Nilus in Egypt, if you believe Strabo and\nPliny, Lib. 7, cap. 3.  What virtue will there be then, said the monk, in\ntheir bullets of concupiscence, their habits and their bodies?\n\nThen, said Grangousier, go your ways, poor men, in the name of God the\nCreator, to whom I pray to guide you perpetually, and henceforward be not\nso ready to undertake these idle and unprofitable journeys.  Look to your\nfamilies, labour every man in his vocation, instruct your children, and\nlive as the good apostle St. Paul directeth you; in doing whereof, God, his\nangels and sancts, will guard and protect you, and no evil or plague at any\ntime shall befall you.  Then Gargantua led them into the hall to take their\nrefection; but the pilgrims did nothing but sigh, and said to Gargantua, O\nhow happy is that land which hath such a man for their lord!  We have been\nmore edified and instructed by the talk which he had with us, than by all\nthe sermons that ever were preached in our town.  This is, said Gargantua,\nthat which Plato saith, Lib. 5 de Republ., that those commonwealths are\nhappy, whose rulers philosophate, and whose philosophers rule.  Then caused\nhe their wallets to be filled with victuals and their bottles with wine,\nand gave unto each of them a horse to ease them upon the way, together with\nsome pence to live by.\n\n\n\n\nHow Grangousier did very kindly entertain Touchfaucet his prisoner.\n\nTouchfaucet was presented unto Grangousier, and by him examined upon the\nenterprise and attempt of Picrochole, what it was he could pretend to, or\naim at, by the rustling stir and tumultuary coil of this his sudden\ninvasion.  Whereunto he answered, that his end and purpose was to conquer\nall the country, if he could, for the injury done to his cake-bakers.  It\nis too great an undertaking, said Grangousier; and, as the proverb is, He\nthat grips too much, holds fast but little.  The time is not now as\nformerly, to conquer the kingdoms of our neighbour princes, and to build up\nour own greatness upon the loss of our nearest Christian Brother.  This\nimitation of the ancient Herculeses, Alexanders, Hannibals, Scipios,\nCaesars, and other such heroes, is quite contrary to the profession of the\ngospel of Christ, by which we are commanded to preserve, keep, rule, and\ngovern every man his own country and lands, and not in a hostile manner to\ninvade others; and that which heretofore the Barbars and Saracens called\nprowess and valour, we do now call robbing, thievery, and wickedness.  It\nwould have been more commendable in him to have contained himself within\nthe bounds of his own territories, royally governing them, than to insult\nand domineer in mine, pillaging and plundering everywhere like a most\nunmerciful enemy; for, by ruling his own with discretion, he might have\nincreased his greatness, but by robbing me he cannot escape destruction.\nGo your ways in the name of God, prosecute good enterprises, show your king\nwhat is amiss, and never counsel him with regard unto your own particular\nprofit, for the public loss will swallow up the private benefit.  As for\nyour ransom, I do freely remit it to you, and will that your arms and horse\nbe restored to you; so should good neighbours do, and ancient friends,\nseeing this our difference is not properly war.  As Plato, Lib. 5 de\nRepub., would not have it called war, but sedition, when the Greeks took up\narms against one another, and that therefore, when such combustions should\narise amongst them, his advice was to behave themselves in the managing of\nthem with all discretion and modesty.  Although you call it war, it is but\nsuperficial; it entereth not into the closet and inmost cabinet of our\nhearts.  For neither of us hath been wronged in his honour, nor is there\nany question betwixt us in the main, but only how to redress, by the bye,\nsome petty faults committed by our men,--I mean, both yours and ours,\nwhich, although you knew, you ought to let pass; for these quarrelsome\npersons deserve rather to be contemned than mentioned, especially seeing I\noffered them satisfaction according to the wrong.  God shall be the just\njudge of our variances, whom I beseech by death rather to take me out of\nthis life, and to permit my goods to perish and be destroyed before mine\neyes, than that by me or mine he should in any sort be wronged.  These\nwords uttered, he called the monk, and before them all thus spoke unto him,\nFriar John, my good friend, it is you that took prisoner the Captain\nTouchfaucet here present?  Sir, said the monk, seeing himself is here, and\nthat he is of the years of discretion, I had rather you should know it by\nhis confession than by any words of mine.  Then said Touchfaucet, My\nsovereign lord it is he indeed that took me, and I do therefore most freely\nyield myself his prisoner.  Have you put him to any ransom? said\nGrangousier to the monk.  No, said the monk, of that I take no care.  How\nmuch would you have for having taken him?  Nothing, nothing, said the monk;\nI am not swayed by that, nor do I regard it.  Then Grangousier commanded\nthat, in presence of Touchfaucet, should be delivered to the monk for\ntaking him the sum of three score and two thousand saluts (in English\nmoney, fifteen thousand and five hundred pounds), which was done, whilst\nthey made a collation or little banquet to the said Touchfaucet, of whom\nGrangousier asked if he would stay with him, or if he loved rather to\nreturn to his king.  Touchfaucet answered that he was content to take\nwhatever course he would advise him to.  Then, said Grangousier, return\nunto your king, and God be with you.\n\nThen he gave him an excellent sword of a Vienne blade, with a golden\nscabbard wrought with vine-branch-like flourishes, of fair goldsmith's\nwork, and a collar or neck-chain of gold, weighing seven hundred and two\nthousand marks (at eight ounces each), garnished with precious stones of\nthe finest sort, esteemed at a hundred and sixty thousand ducats, and ten\nthousand crowns more, as an honourable donative, by way of present.\n\nAfter this talk Touchfaucet got to his horse, and Gargantua for his safety\nallowed him the guard of thirty men-at-arms and six score archers to attend\nhim, under the conduct of Gymnast, to bring him even unto the gate of the\nrock Clermond, if there were need.  As soon as he was gone, the monk\nrestored unto Grangousier the three score and two thousand saluts which he\nhad received, saying, Sir, it is not as yet the time for you to give such\ngifts; stay till this war be at an end, for none can tell what accidents\nmay occur, and war begun without good provision of money beforehand for\ngoing through with it, is but as a breathing of strength, and blast that\nwill quickly pass away.  Coin is the sinews of war.  Well then, said\nGrangousier, at the end I will content you by some honest recompense, as\nalso all those who shall do me good service.\n\n\n\n\nHow Grangousier sent for his legions, and how Touchfaucet slew Rashcalf,\nand was afterwards executed by the command of Picrochole.\n\nAbout this same time those of Besse, of the Old Market, of St. James'\nBourg, of the Draggage, of Parille, of the Rivers, of the rocks St. Pol, of\nthe Vaubreton, of Pautille, of the Brehemont, of Clainbridge, of Cravant,\nof Grammont, of the town at the Badgerholes, of Huymes, of Segre, of Husse,\nof St. Lovant, of Panzoust, of the Coldraux, of Verron, of Coulaines, of\nChose, of Varenes, of Bourgueil, of the Bouchard Island, of the Croullay,\nof Narsay, of Cande, of Montsoreau, and other bordering places, sent\nambassadors unto Grangousier, to tell him that they were advised of the\ngreat wrongs which Picrochole had done him, and, in regard of their ancient\nconfederacy, offered him what assistance they could afford, both in men,\nmoney, victuals, and ammunition, and other necessaries for war.  The money\nwhich by the joint agreement of them all was sent unto him, amounted to six\nscore and fourteen millions, two crowns and a half of pure gold.  The\nforces wherewith they did assist him did consist in fifteen thousand\ncuirassiers, two-and-thirty thousand light horsemen, four score and nine\nthousand dragoons, and a hundred-and-forty thousand volunteer adventurers.\nThese had with them eleven thousand and two hundred cannons, double\ncannons, long pieces of artillery called basilisks, and smaller sized ones\nknown by the name of spirols, besides the mortar-pieces and grenadoes.  Of\npioneers they had seven-and-forty thousand, all victualled and paid for six\nmonths and four days of advance.  Which offer Gargantua did not altogether\nrefuse, nor wholly accept of; but, giving them hearty thanks, said that he\nwould compose and order the war by such a device, that there should not be\nfound great need to put so many honest men to trouble in the managing of\nit; and therefore was content at that time to give order only for bringing\nalong the legions which he maintained in his ordinary garrison towns of the\nDeviniere, of Chavigny, of Gravot, and of the Quinquenais, amounting to the\nnumber of two thousand cuirassiers, three score and six thousand\nfoot-soldiers, six-and-twenty thousand dragoons, attended by two hundred\npieces of great ordnance, two-and-twenty thousand pioneers, and six thousand\nlight horsemen, all drawn up in troops, so well befitted and accommodated\nwith their commissaries, sutlers, farriers, harness-makers, and other such\nlike necessary members in a military camp, so fully instructed in the art of\nwarfare, so perfectly knowing and following their colours, so ready to hear\nand obey their captains, so nimble to run, so strong at their charging, so\nprudent in their adventures, and every day so well disciplined, that they\nseemed rather to be a concert of organ-pipes, or mutual concord of the\nwheels of a clock, than an infantry and cavalry, or army of soldiers.\n\nTouchfaucet immediately after his return presented himself before\nPicrochole, and related unto him at large all that he had done and seen,\nand at last endeavoured to persuade him with strong and forcible arguments\nto capitulate and make an agreement with Grangousier, whom he found to be\nthe honestest man in the world; saying further, that it was neither right\nnor reason thus to trouble his neighbours, of whom they had never received\nanything but good.  And in regard of the main point, that they should never\nbe able to go through stitch with that war, but to their great damage and\nmischief; for the forces of Picrochole were not so considerable but that\nGrangousier could easily overthrow them.\n\nHe had not well done speaking when Rashcalf said out aloud, Unhappy is that\nprince which is by such men served, who are so easily corrupted, as I know\nTouchfaucet is.  For I see his courage so changed that he had willingly\njoined with our enemies to fight against us and betray us, if they would\nhave received him; but as virtue is of all, both friends and foes, praised\nand esteemed, so is wickedness soon known and suspected, and although it\nhappen the enemies to make use thereof for their profit, yet have they\nalways the wicked and the traitors in abomination.\n\nTouchfaucet being at these words very impatient, drew out his sword, and\ntherewith ran Rashcalf through the body, a little under the nipple of his\nleft side, whereof he died presently, and pulling back his sword out of his\nbody said boldly, So let him perish that shall a faithful servant blame.\nPicrochole incontinently grew furious, and seeing Touchfaucet's new sword\nand his scabbard so richly diapered with flourishes of most excellent\nworkmanship, said, Did they give thee this weapon so feloniously therewith\nto kill before my face my so good friend Rashcalf?  Then immediately\ncommanded he his guard to hew him in pieces, which was instantly done, and\nthat so cruelly that the chamber was all dyed with blood.  Afterwards he\nappointed the corpse of Rashcalf to be honourably buried, and that of\nTouchfaucet to be cast over the walls into the ditch.\n\nThe news of these excessive violences were quickly spread through all the\narmy; whereupon many began to murmur against Picrochole, in so far that\nPinchpenny said to him, My sovereign lord, I know not what the issue of\nthis enterprise will be.  I see your men much dejected, and not well\nresolved in their minds, by considering that we are here very ill provided\nof victual, and that our number is already much diminished by three or four\nsallies.  Furthermore, great supplies and recruits come daily in to your\nenemies; but we so moulder away that, if we be once besieged, I do not see\nhow we can escape a total destruction.  Tush, pish, said Picrochole, you\nare like the Melun eels, you cry before they come to you.  Let them come,\nlet them come, if they dare.\n\n\n\n\nHow Gargantua set upon Picrochole within the rock Clermond, and utterly\ndefeated the army of the said Picrochole.\n\nGargantua had the charge of the whole army, and his father Grangousier\nstayed in his castle, who, encouraging them with good words, promised great\nrewards unto those that should do any notable service.  Having thus set\nforward, as soon as they had gained the pass at the ford of Vede, with\nboats and bridges speedily made they passed over in a trice.  Then\nconsidering the situation of the town, which was on a high and advantageous\nplace, Gargantua thought fit to call his council, and pass that night in\ndeliberation upon what was to be done.  But Gymnast said unto him, My\nsovereign lord, such is the nature and complexion of the French, that they\nare worth nothing but at the first push.  Then are they more fierce than\ndevils.  But if they linger a little and be wearied with delays, they'll\nprove more faint and remiss than women.  My opinion is, therefore, that now\npresently, after your men have taken breath and some small refection, you\ngive order for a resolute assault, and that we storm them instantly.  His\nadvice was found very good, and for effectuating thereof he brought forth\nhis army into the plain field, and placed the reserves on the skirt or\nrising of a little hill.  The monk took along with him six companies of\nfoot and two hundred horsemen well armed, and with great diligence crossed\nthe marsh, and valiantly got upon the top of the green hillock even unto\nthe highway which leads to Loudun.  Whilst the assault was thus begun,\nPicrochole's men could not tell well what was best, to issue out and\nreceive the assailants, or keep within the town and not to stir.  Himself\nin the mean time, without deliberation, sallied forth in a rage with the\ncavalry of his guard, who were forthwith received and royally entertained\nwith great cannon-shot that fell upon them like hail from the high grounds\non which the artillery was planted.  Whereupon the Gargantuists betook\nthemselves unto the valleys, to give the ordnance leave to play and range\nwith the larger scope.\n\nThose of the town defended themselves as well as they could, but their shot\npassed over us without doing us any hurt at all.  Some of Picrochole's men\nthat had escaped our artillery set most fiercely upon our soldiers, but\nprevailed little; for they were all let in betwixt the files, and there\nknocked down to the ground, which their fellow-soldiers seeing, they would\nhave retreated, but the monk having seized upon the pass by the which they\nwere to return, they ran away and fled in all the disorder and confusion\nthat could be imagined.\n\nSome would have pursued after them and followed the chase, but the monk\nwithheld them, apprehending that in their pursuit the pursuers might lose\ntheir ranks, and so give occasion to the besieged to sally out of the town\nupon them.  Then staying there some space and none coming against him, he\nsent the Duke Phrontist to advise Gargantua to advance towards the hill\nupon the left hand, to hinder Picrochole's retreat at that gate; which\nGargantua did with all expedition, and sent thither four brigades under the\nconduct of Sebast, which had no sooner reached the top of the hill, but\nthey met Picrochole in the teeth, and those that were with him scattered.\n\nThen charged they upon them stoutly, yet were they much endamaged by those\nthat were upon the walls, who galled them with all manner of shot, both\nfrom the great ordnance, small guns, and bows.  Which Gargantua perceiving,\nhe went with a strong party to their relief, and with his artillery began\nto thunder so terribly upon that canton of the wall, and so long, that all\nthe strength within the town, to maintain and fill up the breach, was drawn\nthither.  The monk seeing that quarter which he kept besieged void of men\nand competent guards, and in a manner altogether naked and abandoned, did\nmost magnanimously on a sudden lead up his men towards the fort, and never\nleft it till he had got up upon it, knowing that such as come to the\nreserve in a conflict bring with them always more fear and terror than\nthose that deal about them with they hands in the fight.\n\nNevertheless, he gave no alarm till all his soldiers had got within the\nwall, except the two hundred horsemen, whom he left without to secure his\nentry.  Then did he give a most horrible shout, so did all these who were\nwith him, and immediately thereafter, without resistance, putting to the\nedge of the sword the guard that was at that gate, they opened it to the\nhorsemen, with whom most furiously they altogether ran towards the east\ngate, where all the hurlyburly was, and coming close upon them in the rear\noverthrew all their forces.\n\nThe besieged, seeing that the Gargantuists had won the town upon them, and\nthat they were like to be secure in no corner of it, submitted themselves\nunto the mercy of the monk, and asked for quarter, which the monk very\nnobly granted to them, yet made them lay down their arms; then, shutting\nthem up within churches, gave order to seize upon all the staves of the\ncrosses, and placed men at the doors to keep them from coming forth.  Then\nopening that east gate, he issued out to succour and assist Gargantua.  But\nPicrochole, thinking it had been some relief coming to him from the town,\nadventured more forwardly than before, and was upon the giving of a most\ndesperate home-charge, when Gargantua cried out, Ha, Friar John, my friend\nFriar John, you are come in a good hour.  Which unexpected accident so\naffrighted Picrochole and his men, that, giving all for lost, they betook\nthemselves to their heels, and fled on all hands.  Gargantua chased them\ntill they came near to Vaugaudry, killing and slaying all the way, and then\nsounded the retreat.\n\n\n\n\nHow Picrochole in his flight fell into great misfortunes, and what\nGargantua did after the battle.\n\nPicrochole thus in despair fled towards the Bouchard Island, and in the way\nto Riviere his horse stumbled and fell down, whereat he on a sudden was so\nincensed, that he with his sword without more ado killed him in his choler;\nthen, not finding any that would remount him, he was about to have taken an\nass at the mill that was thereby; but the miller's men did so baste his\nbones and so soundly bethwack him that they made him both black and blue\nwith strokes; then stripping him of all his clothes, gave him a scurvy old\ncanvas jacket wherewith to cover his nakedness.  Thus went along this poor\ncholeric wretch, who, passing the water at Port-Huaulx, and relating his\nmisadventurous disasters, was foretold by an old Lourpidon hag that his\nkingdom should be restored to him at the coming of the Cocklicranes, which\nshe called Coquecigrues.  What is become of him since we cannot certainly\ntell, yet was I told that he is now a porter at Lyons, as testy and pettish\nin humour as ever he was before, and would be always with great lamentation\ninquiring at all strangers of the coming of the Cocklicranes, expecting\nassuredly, according to the old woman's prophecy, that at their coming he\nshall be re-established in his kingdom.  The first thing Gargantua did\nafter his return into the town was to call the muster-roll of his men,\nwhich when he had done, he found that there were very few either killed or\nwounded, only some few foot of Captain Tolmere's company, and Ponocrates,\nwho was shot with a musket-ball through the doublet.  Then he caused them\nall at and in their several posts and divisions to take a little\nrefreshment, which was very plenteously provided for them in the best drink\nand victuals that could be had for money, and gave order to the treasurers\nand commissaries of the army to pay for and defray that repast, and that\nthere should be no outrage at all nor abuse committed in the town, seeing\nit was his own.  And furthermore commanded, that immediately after the\nsoldiers had done with eating and drinking for that time sufficiently and\nto their own hearts' desire, a gathering should be beaten for bringing them\naltogether, to be drawn up on the piazza before the castle, there to\nreceive six months' pay completely.  All which was done.  After this, by\nhis direction, were brought before him in the said place all those that\nremained of Picrochole's party, unto whom, in the presence of the princes,\nnobles, and officers of his court and army, he spoke as followeth.\n\n\n\n\nGargantua's speech to the vanquished.\n\nOur forefathers and ancestors of all times have been of this nature and\ndisposition, that, upon the winning of a battle, they have chosen rather,\nfor a sign and memorial of their triumphs and victories, to erect trophies\nand monuments in the hearts of the vanquished by clemency than by\narchitecture in the lands which they had conquered.  For they did hold in\ngreater estimation the lively remembrance of men purchased by liberality\nthan the dumb inscription of arches, pillars, and pyramids, subject to the\ninjury of storms and tempests, and to the envy of everyone.  You may very\nwell remember of the courtesy which by them was used towards the Bretons in\nthe battle of St. Aubin of Cormier and at the demolishing of Partenay.  You\nhave heard, and hearing admire, their gentle comportment towards those at\nthe barriers (the barbarians) of Spaniola, who had plundered, wasted, and\nransacked the maritime borders of Olone and Thalmondois.  All this\nhemisphere of the world was filled with the praises and congratulations\nwhich yourselves and your fathers made, when Alpharbal, King of Canarre,\nnot satisfied with his own fortunes, did most furiously invade the land of\nOnyx, and with cruel piracies molest all the Armoric Islands and confine\nregions of Britany.  Yet was he in a set naval fight justly taken and\nvanquished by my father, whom God preserve and protect.  But what?  Whereas\nother kings and emperors, yea, those who entitle themselves Catholics,\nwould have dealt roughly with him, kept him a close prisoner, and put him\nto an extreme high ransom, he entreated him very courteously, lodged him\nkindly with himself in his own palace, and out of his incredible mildness\nand gentle disposition sent him back with a safe conduct, laden with gifts,\nladen with favours, laden with all offices of friendship.  What fell out\nupon it?  Being returned into his country, he called a parliament, where\nall the princes and states of his kingdom being assembled, he showed them\nthe humanity which he had found in us, and therefore wished them to take\nsuch course by way of compensation therein as that the whole world might be\nedified by the example, as well of their honest graciousness to us as of\nour gracious honesty towards them.  The result hereof was, that it was\nvoted and decreed by an unanimous consent, that they should offer up\nentirely their lands, dominions, and kingdoms, to be disposed of by us\naccording to our pleasure.\n\nAlpharbal in his own person presently returned with nine thousand and\nthirty-eight great ships of burden, bringing with him the treasures, not\nonly of his house and royal lineage, but almost of all the country besides.\nFor he embarking himself, to set sail with a west-north-east wind, everyone\nin heaps did cast into the ship gold, silver, rings, jewels, spices, drugs,\nand aromatical perfumes, parrots, pelicans, monkeys, civet-cats,\nblack-spotted weasels, porcupines, &c.  He was accounted no good mother's\nson that did not cast in all the rare and precious things he had.\n\nBeing safely arrived, he came to my said father, and would have kissed his\nfeet.  That action was found too submissively low, and therefore was not\npermitted, but in exchange he was most cordially embraced.  He offered his\npresents; they were not received, because they were too excessive:  he\nyielded himself voluntarily a servant and vassal, and was content his whole\nposterity should be liable to the same bondage; this was not accepted of,\nbecause it seemed not equitable:  he surrendered, by virtue of the decree\nof his great parliamentary council, his whole countries and kingdoms to\nhim, offering the deed and conveyance, signed, sealed, and ratified by all\nthose that were concerned in it; this was altogether refused, and the\nparchments cast into the fire.  In end, this free goodwill and simple\nmeaning of the Canarians wrought such tenderness in my father's heart that\nhe could not abstain from shedding tears, and wept most profusely; then, by\nchoice words very congruously adapted, strove in what he could to diminish\nthe estimation of the good offices which he had done them, saying, that any\ncourtesy he had conferred upon them was not worth a rush, and what favour\nsoever he had showed them he was bound to do it.  But so much the more did\nAlpharbal augment the repute thereof.  What was the issue?  Whereas for his\nransom, in the greatest extremity of rigour and most tyrannical dealing,\ncould not have been exacted above twenty times a hundred thousand crowns,\nand his eldest sons detained as hostages till that sum had been paid, they\nmade themselves perpetual tributaries, and obliged to give us every year\ntwo millions of gold at four-and-twenty carats fine.  The first year we\nreceived the whole sum of two millions; the second year of their own accord\nthey paid freely to us three-and-twenty hundred thousand crowns; the third\nyear, six-and-twenty hundred thousand; the fourth year, three millions, and\ndo so increase it always out of their own goodwill that we shall be\nconstrained to forbid them to bring us any more.  This is the nature of\ngratitude and true thankfulness.  For time, which gnaws and diminisheth all\nthings else, augments and increaseth benefits; because a noble action of\nliberality, done to a man of reason, doth grow continually by his generous\nthinking of it and remembering it.\n\nBeing unwilling therefore any way to degenerate from the hereditary\nmildness and clemency of my parents, I do now forgive you, deliver you from\nall fines and imprisonments, fully release you, set you at liberty, and\nevery way make you as frank and free as ever you were before.  Moreover, at\nyour going out of the gate, you shall have every one of you three months'\npay to bring you home into your houses and families, and shall have a safe\nconvoy of six hundred cuirassiers and eight thousand foot under the conduct\nof Alexander, esquire of my body, that the clubmen of the country may not\ndo you any injury.  God be with you!  I am sorry from my heart that\nPicrochole is not here; for I would have given him to understand that this\nwar was undertaken against my will and without any hope to increase either\nmy goods or renown.  But seeing he is lost, and that no man can tell where\nnor how he went away, it is my will that his kingdom remain entire to his\nson; who, because he is too young, he not being yet full five years old,\nshall be brought up and instructed by the ancient princes and learned men\nof the kingdom.  And because a realm thus desolate may easily come to ruin,\nif the covetousness and avarice of those who by their places are obliged to\nadminister justice in it be not curbed and restrained, I ordain and will\nhave it so, that Ponocrates be overseer and superintendent above all his\ngovernors, with whatever power and authority is requisite thereto, and that\nhe be continually with the child until he find him able and capable to rule\nand govern by himself.\n\nNow I must tell you, that you are to understand how a too feeble and\ndissolute facility in pardoning evildoers giveth them occasion to commit\nwickedness afterwards more readily, upon this pernicious confidence of\nreceiving favour.  I consider that Moses, the meekest man that was in his\ntime upon the earth, did severely punish the mutinous and seditious people\nof Israel.  I consider likewise that Julius Caesar, who was so gracious an\nemperor that Cicero said of him that his fortune had nothing more excellent\nthan that he could, and his virtue nothing better than that he would always\nsave and pardon every man--he, notwithstanding all this, did in certain\nplaces most rigorously punish the authors of rebellion.  After the example\nof these good men, it is my will and pleasure that you deliver over unto me\nbefore you depart hence, first, that fine fellow Marquet, who was the prime\ncause, origin, and groundwork of this war by his vain presumption and\noverweening; secondly, his fellow cake-bakers, who were neglective in\nchecking and reprehending his idle hairbrained humour in the instant time;\nand lastly, all the councillors, captains, officers, and domestics of\nPicrochole, who had been incendiaries or fomenters of the war by provoking,\npraising, or counselling him to come out of his limits thus to trouble us.\n\n\n\n\nHow the victorious Gargantuists were recompensed after the battle.\n\nWhen Gargantua had finished his speech, the seditious men whom he required\nwere delivered up unto him, except Swashbuckler, Dirt-tail, and Smalltrash,\nwho ran away six hours before the battle--one of them as far as to\nLainiel-neck at one course, another to the valley of Vire, and the third\neven unto Logroine, without looking back or taking breath by the way--and\ntwo of the cake-bakers who were slain in the fight.  Gargantua did them no\nother hurt but that he appointed them to pull at the presses of his\nprinting-house which he had newly set up.  Then those who died there he\ncaused to be honourably buried in Black-soile valley and Burn-hag field, and\ngave order that the wounded should be dressed and had care of in his great\nhospital or nosocome.  After this, considering the great prejudice done to\nthe town and its inhabitants, he reimbursed their charges and repaired all\nthe losses that by their confession upon oath could appear they had\nsustained; and, for their better defence and security in times coming\nagainst all sudden uproars and invasions, commanded a strong citadel to be\nbuilt there with a competent garrison to maintain it.  At his departure he\ndid very graciously thank all the soldiers of the brigades that had been at\nthis overthrow, and sent them back to their winter-quarters in their several\nstations and garrisons; the decumane legion only excepted, whom in the field\non that day he saw do some great exploit, and their captains also, whom he\nbrought along with himself unto Grangousier.\n\nAt the sight and coming of them, the good man was so joyful, that it is not\npossible fully to describe it.  He made them a feast the most magnificent,\nplentiful, and delicious that ever was seen since the time of the king\nAhasuerus.  At the taking up of the table he distributed amongst them his\nwhole cupboard of plate, which weighed eight hundred thousand and fourteen\nbezants (Each bezant is worth five pounds English money.) of gold, in great\nantique vessels, huge pots, large basins, big tasses, cups, goblets,\ncandlesticks, comfit-boxes, and other such plate, all of pure massy gold,\nbesides the precious stones, enamelling, and workmanship, which by all\nmen's estimation was more worth than the matter of the gold.  Then unto\nevery one of them out of his coffers caused he to be given the sum of\ntwelve hundred thousand crowns ready money.  And, further, he gave to each\nof them for ever and in perpetuity, unless he should happen to decease\nwithout heirs, such castles and neighbouring lands of his as were most\ncommodious for them.  To Ponocrates he gave the rock Clermond; to Gymnast,\nthe Coudray; to Eudemon, Montpensier; Rivau, to Tolmere, to Ithibolle,\nMontsoreau; to Acamas, Cande; Varenes, to Chironacte; Gravot, to Sebast;\nQuinquenais, to Alexander; Legre, to Sophrone, and so of his other places.\n\n\n\n\nHow Gargantua caused to be built for the Monk the Abbey of Theleme.\n\nThere was left only the monk to provide for, whom Gargantua would have made\nAbbot of Seville, but he refused it.  He would have given him the Abbey of\nBourgueil, or of Sanct Florent, which was better, or both, if it pleased\nhim; but the monk gave him a very peremptory answer, that he would never\ntake upon him the charge nor government of monks.  For how shall I be able,\nsaid he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command of\nmyself?  If you think I have done you, or may hereafter do any acceptable\nservice, give me leave to found an abbey after my own mind and fancy.  The\nmotion pleased Gargantua very well, who thereupon offered him all the\ncountry of Theleme by the river of Loire till within two leagues of the\ngreat forest of Port-Huaulx.  The monk then requested Gargantua to\ninstitute his religious order contrary to all others.  First, then, said\nGargantua, you must not build a wall about your convent, for all other\nabbeys are strongly walled and mured about.  See, said the monk, and not\nwithout cause (seeing wall and mur signify but one and the same thing);\nwhere there is mur before and mur behind, there is store of murmur, envy,\nand mutual conspiracy.  Moreover, seeing there are certain convents in the\nworld whereof the custom is, if any woman come in, I mean chaste and honest\nwomen, they immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon;\ntherefore was it ordained, that if any man or woman entered into religious\norders should by chance come within this new abbey, all the rooms should be\nthoroughly washed and cleansed through which they had passed.  And because\nin all other monasteries and nunneries all is compassed, limited, and\nregulated by hours, it was decreed that in this new structure there should\nbe neither clock nor dial, but that according to the opportunities and\nincident occasions all their hours should be disposed of; for, said\nGargantua, the greatest loss of time that I know is to count the hours.\nWhat good comes of it?  Nor can there be any greater dotage in the world\nthan for one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of a bell, and\nnot by his own judgment and discretion.\n\nItem, Because at that time they put no women into nunneries but such as\nwere either purblind, blinkards, lame, crooked, ill-favoured, misshapen,\nfools, senseless, spoiled, or corrupt; nor encloistered any men but those\nthat were either sickly, subject to defluxions, ill-bred louts, simple\nsots, or peevish trouble-houses.  But to the purpose, said the monk.  A\nwoman that is neither fair nor good, to what use serves she?  To make a nun\nof, said Gargantua.  Yea, said the monk, and to make shirts and smocks.\nTherefore was it ordained that into this religious order should be admitted\nno women that were not fair, well-featured, and of a sweet disposition; nor\nmen that were not comely, personable, and well conditioned.\n\nItem, Because in the convents of women men come not but underhand, privily,\nand by stealth, it was therefore enacted that in this house there shall be\nno women in case there be not men, nor men in case there be not women.\n\nItem, Because both men and women that are received into religious orders\nafter the expiring of their noviciate or probation year were constrained\nand forced perpetually to stay there all the days of their life, it was\ntherefore ordered that all whatever, men or women, admitted within this\nabbey, should have full leave to depart with peace and contentment\nwhensoever it should seem good to them so to do.\n\nItem, for that the religious men and women did ordinarily make three vows,\nto wit, those of chastity, poverty, and obedience, it was therefore\nconstituted and appointed that in this convent they might be honourably\nmarried, that they might be rich, and live at liberty.  In regard of the\nlegitimate time of the persons to be initiated, and years under and above\nwhich they were not capable of reception, the women were to be admitted\nfrom ten till fifteen, and the men from twelve till eighteen.\n\n\n\n\nHow the abbey of the Thelemites was built and endowed.\n\nFor the fabric and furniture of the abbey Gargantua caused to be delivered\nout in ready money seven-and-twenty hundred thousand, eight hundred and\none-and-thirty of those golden rams of Berry which have a sheep stamped on\nthe one side and a flowered cross on the other; and for every year, until\nthe whole work were completed, he allotted threescore nine thousand crowns\nof the sun, and as many of the seven stars, to be charged all upon the\nreceipt of the custom.  For the foundation and maintenance thereof for\never, he settled a perpetual fee-farm-rent of three-and-twenty hundred,\nthree score and nine thousand, five hundred and fourteen rose nobles,\nexempted from all homage, fealty, service, or burden whatsoever, and\npayable every year at the gate of the abbey; and of this by letters patent\npassed a very good grant.  The architecture was in a figure hexagonal, and\nin such a fashion that in every one of the six corners there was built a\ngreat round tower of threescore foot in diameter, and were all of a like\nform and bigness.  Upon the north side ran along the river of Loire, on the\nbank whereof was situated the tower called Arctic.  Going towards the east,\nthere was another called Calaer,--the next following Anatole,--the next\nMesembrine,--the next Hesperia, and the last Criere.  Every tower was\ndistant from other the space of three hundred and twelve paces.  The whole\nedifice was everywhere six storeys high, reckoning the cellars underground\nfor one.  The second was arched after the fashion of a basket-handle; the\nrest were ceiled with pure wainscot, flourished with Flanders fretwork, in\nthe form of the foot of a lamp, and covered above with fine slates, with an\nendorsement of lead, carrying the antique figures of little puppets and\nanimals of all sorts, notably well suited to one another, and gilt,\ntogether with the gutters, which, jutting without the walls from betwixt\nthe crossbars in a diagonal figure, painted with gold and azure, reached to\nthe very ground, where they ended into great conduit-pipes, which carried\nall away unto the river from under the house.\n\nThis same building was a hundred times more sumptuous and magnificent than\never was Bonnivet, Chambourg, or Chantilly; for there were in it nine\nthousand, three hundred and two-and-thirty chambers, every one whereof had\na withdrawing-room, a handsome closet, a wardrobe, an oratory, and neat\npassage, leading into a great and spacious hall.  Between every tower in\nthe midst of the said body of building there was a pair of winding, such as\nwe now call lantern stairs, whereof the steps were part of porphyry, which\nis a dark red marble spotted with white, part of Numidian stone, which is a\nkind of yellowishly-streaked marble upon various colours, and part of\nserpentine marble, with light spots on a dark green ground, each of those\nsteps being two-and-twenty foot in length and three fingers thick, and the\njust number of twelve betwixt every rest, or, as we now term it,\nlanding-place.  In every resting-place were two fair antique arches where\nthe light came in:  and by those they went into a cabinet, made even with\nand of the breadth of the said winding, and the reascending above the roofs\nof the house ended conically in a pavilion.  By that vise or winding they\nentered on every side into a great hall, and from the halls into the\nchambers. From the Arctic tower unto the Criere were the fair great\nlibraries in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, Italian, and Spanish,\nrespectively distributed in their several cantons, according to the\ndiversity of these languages.  In the midst there was a wonderful scalier or\nwinding-stair, the entry whereof was without the house, in a vault or arch\nsix fathom broad.  It was made in such symmetry and largeness that six\nmen-at-arms with their lances in their rests might together in a breast ride\nall up to the very top of all the palace.  From the tower Anatole to the\nMesembrine were fair spacious galleries, all coloured over and painted with\nthe ancient prowesses, histories, and descriptions of the world.  In the\nmidst thereof there was likewise such another ascent and gate as we said\nthere was on the river-side.  Upon that gate was written in great antique\nletters that which followeth.\n\n\n\n\nThe inscription set upon the great gate of Theleme.\n\nHere enter not vile bigots, hypocrites,\nExternally devoted apes, base snites,\nPuffed-up, wry-necked beasts, worse than the Huns,\nOr Ostrogoths, forerunners of baboons:\nCursed snakes, dissembled varlets, seeming sancts,\nSlipshod caffards, beggars pretending wants,\nFat chuffcats, smell-feast knockers, doltish gulls,\nOut-strouting cluster-fists, contentious bulls,\nFomenters of divisions and debates,\nElsewhere, not here, make sale of your deceits.\n\n  Your filthy trumperies\n  Stuffed with pernicious lies\n    (Not worth a bubble),\n    Would do but trouble\n  Our earthly paradise,\n  Your filthy trumperies.\n\nHere enter not attorneys, barristers,\nNor bridle-champing law-practitioners:\nClerks, commissaries, scribes, nor pharisees,\nWilful disturbers of the people's ease:\nJudges, destroyers, with an unjust breath,\nOf honest men, like dogs, even unto death.\nYour salary is at the gibbet-foot:\nGo drink there! for we do not here fly out\nOn those excessive courses, which may draw\nA waiting on your courts by suits in law.\n\n  Lawsuits, debates, and wrangling\n  Hence are exiled, and jangling.\n    Here we are very\n    Frolic and merry,\n  And free from all entangling,\n  Lawsuits, debates, and wrangling.\n\nHere enter not base pinching usurers,\nPelf-lickers, everlasting gatherers,\nGold-graspers, coin-gripers, gulpers of mists,\nNiggish deformed sots, who, though your chests\nVast sums of money should to you afford,\nWould ne'ertheless add more unto that hoard,\nAnd yet not be content,--you clunchfist dastards,\nInsatiable fiends, and Pluto's bastards,\nGreedy devourers, chichy sneakbill rogues,\nHell-mastiffs gnaw your bones, you ravenous dogs.\n\n  You beastly-looking fellows,\n  Reason doth plainly tell us\n    That we should not\n    To you allot\n  Room here, but at the gallows,\n  You beastly-looking fellows.\n\nHere enter not fond makers of demurs\nIn love adventures, peevish, jealous curs,\nSad pensive dotards, raisers of garboils,\nHags, goblins, ghosts, firebrands of household broils,\nNor drunkards, liars, cowards, cheaters, clowns,\nThieves, cannibals, faces o'ercast with frowns,\nNor lazy slugs, envious, covetous,\nNor blockish, cruel, nor too credulous,--\nHere mangy, pocky folks shall have no place,\nNo ugly lusks, nor persons of disgrace.\n\n  Grace, honour, praise, delight,\n  Here sojourn day and night.\n    Sound bodies lined\n    With a good mind,\n  Do here pursue with might\n  Grace, honour, praise, delight.\n\nHere enter you, and welcome from our hearts,\nAll noble sparks, endowed with gallant parts.\nThis is the glorious place, which bravely shall\nAfford wherewith to entertain you all.\nWere you a thousand, here you shall not want\nFor anything; for what you'll ask we'll grant.\nStay here, you lively, jovial, handsome, brisk,\nGay, witty, frolic, cheerful, merry, frisk,\nSpruce, jocund, courteous, furtherers of trades,\nAnd, in a word, all worthy gentle blades.\n\n  Blades of heroic breasts\n  Shall taste here of the feasts,\n    Both privily\n    And civilly\n  Of the celestial guests,\n  Blades of heroic breasts.\n\nHere enter you, pure, honest, faithful, true\nExpounders of the Scriptures old and new.\nWhose glosses do not blind our reason, but\nMake it to see the clearer, and who shut\nIts passages from hatred, avarice,\nPride, factions, covenants, and all sort of vice.\nCome, settle here a charitable faith,\nWhich neighbourly affection nourisheth.\nAnd whose light chaseth all corrupters hence,\nOf the blest word, from the aforesaid sense.\n\n  The holy sacred Word,\n  May it always afford\n    T' us all in common,\n    Both man and woman,\n  A spiritual shield and sword,\n  The holy sacred Word.\n\nHere enter you all ladies of high birth,\nDelicious, stately, charming, full of mirth,\nIngenious, lovely, miniard, proper, fair,\nMagnetic, graceful, splendid, pleasant, rare,\nObliging, sprightly, virtuous, young, solacious,\nKind, neat, quick, feat, bright, compt, ripe, choice, dear, precious.\nAlluring, courtly, comely, fine, complete,\nWise, personable, ravishing, and sweet,\nCome joys enjoy.

Upon the top thereof stood the three Graces, with their\ncornucopias, or horns of abundance, and did jet out the water at their\nbreasts, mouth, ears, eyes, and other open passages of the body.  The\ninside of the buildings in this lower court stood upon great pillars of\nchalcedony stone and porphyry marble made archways after a goodly antique\nfashion.  Within those were spacious galleries, long and large, adorned\nwith curious pictures, the horns of bucks and unicorns:  with rhinoceroses,\nwater-horses called hippopotames, the teeth and tusks of elephants, and\nother things well worth the beholding.  The lodging of the ladies, for so\nwe may call those gallant women, took up all from the tower Arctic unto the\ngate Mesembrine.  The men possessed the rest.  Before the said lodging of\nthe ladies, that they might have their recreation, between the two first\ntowers, on the outside, were placed the tiltyard, the barriers or lists for\ntournaments, the hippodrome or riding-court, the theatre or public\nplayhouse, and natatory or place to swim in, with most admirable baths in\nthree stages, situated above one another, well furnished with all necessary\naccommodation, and store of myrtle-water.  By the river-side was the fair\ngarden of pleasure, and in the midst of that the glorious labyrinth.\nBetween the two other towers were the courts for the tennis and the\nballoon.  Towards the tower Criere stood the orchard full of all\nfruit-trees, set and ranged in a quincuncial order.  At the end of that was\nthe great park, abounding with all sort of venison.  Betwixt the third\ncouple of towers were the butts and marks for shooting with a snapwork gun,\nan ordinary bow for common archery, or with a crossbow.  The office-houses\nwere without the tower Hesperia, of one storey high.  The stables were\nbeyond the offices, and before them stood the falconry, managed by\nostrich-keepers and falconers very expert in the art, and it was yearly\nsupplied and furnished by the Candians, Venetians, Sarmates, now called\nMuscoviters, with all sorts of most excellent hawks, eagles, gerfalcons,\ngoshawks, sacres, lanners, falcons, sparrowhawks, marlins, and other kinds\nof them, so gentle and perfectly well manned, that, flying of themselves\nsometimes from the castle for their own disport, they would not fail to\ncatch whatever they encountered.  The venery, where the beagles and hounds\nwere kept, was a little farther off, drawing towards the park.\n\nAll the halls, chambers, and closets or cabinets were richly hung with\ntapestry and hangings of divers sorts, according to the variety of the\nseasons of the year.  All the pavements and floors were covered with green\ncloth.  The beds were all embroidered.  In every back-chamber or\nwithdrawing-room there was a looking-glass of pure crystal set in a frame\nof fine gold, garnished all about with pearls, and was of such greatness\nthat it would represent to the full the whole lineaments and proportion of\nthe person that stood before it.  At the going out of the halls which\nbelong to the ladies' lodgings were the perfumers and trimmers through\nwhose hands the gallants passed when they were to visit the ladies.  Those\nsweet artificers did every morning furnish the ladies' chambers with the\nspirit of roses, orange-flower-water, and angelica; and to each of them\ngave a little precious casket vapouring forth the most odoriferous\nexhalations of the choicest aromatical scents.\n\n\n\n\nHow the men and women of the religious order of Theleme were apparelled.\n\nThe ladies at the foundation of this order were apparelled after their own\npleasure and liking; but, since that of their own accord and free will they\nhave reformed themselves, their accoutrement is in manner as followeth.\nThey wore stockings of scarlet crimson, or ingrained purple dye, which\nreached just three inches above the knee, having a list beautified with\nexquisite embroideries and rare incisions of the cutter's art.  Their\ngarters were of the colour of their bracelets, and circled the knee a\nlittle both over and under.  Their shoes, pumps, and slippers were either\nof red, violet, or crimson-velvet, pinked and jagged like lobster waddles.\n\nNext to their smock they put on the pretty kirtle or vasquin of pure silk\ncamlet:  above that went the taffety or tabby farthingale, of white, red,\ntawny, grey, or of any other colour.  Above this taffety petticoat they had\nanother of cloth of tissue or brocade, embroidered with fine gold and\ninterlaced with needlework, or as they thought good, and according to the\ntemperature and disposition of the weather had their upper coats of satin,\ndamask, or velvet, and those either orange, tawny, green, ash-coloured,\nblue, yellow, bright red, crimson, or white, and so forth; or had them of\ncloth of gold, cloth of silver, or some other choice stuff, enriched with\npurl, or embroidered according to the dignity of the festival days and\ntimes wherein they wore them.\n\nTheir gowns, being still correspondent to the season, were either of cloth\nof gold frizzled with a silver-raised work; of red satin, covered with gold\npurl; of tabby, or taffety, white, blue, black, tawny, &c., of silk serge,\nsilk camlet, velvet, cloth of silver, silver tissue, cloth of gold, gold\nwire, figured velvet, or figured satin tinselled and overcast with golden\nthreads, in divers variously purfled draughts.\n\nIn the summer some days instead of gowns they wore light handsome mantles,\nmade either of the stuff of the aforesaid attire, or like Moresco rugs, of\nviolet velvet frizzled, with a raised work of gold upon silver purl, or\nwith a knotted cord-work of gold embroidery, everywhere garnished with\nlittle Indian pearls.  They always carried a fair panache, or plume of\nfeathers, of the colour of their muff, bravely adorned and tricked out with\nglistering spangles of gold.  In the winter time they had their taffety\ngowns of all colours, as above-named, and those lined with the rich\nfurrings of hind-wolves, or speckled lynxes, black-spotted weasels, martlet\nskins of Calabria, sables, and other costly furs of an inestimable value.\nTheir beads, rings, bracelets, collars, carcanets, and neck-chains were all\nof precious stones, such as carbuncles, rubies, baleus, diamonds,\nsapphires, emeralds, turquoises, garnets, agates, beryls, and excellent\nmargarites.  Their head-dressing also varied with the season of the year,\naccording to which they decked themselves.  In winter it was of the French\nfashion; in the spring, of the Spanish; in summer, of the fashion of\nTuscany, except only upon the holy days and Sundays, at which times they\nwere accoutred in the French mode, because they accounted it more\nhonourable and better befitting the garb of a matronal pudicity.\n\nThe men were apparelled after their fashion.  Their stockings were of\ntamine or of cloth serge, of white, black, scarlet, or some other ingrained\ncolour.  Their breeches were of velvet, of the same colour with their\nstockings, or very near, embroidered and cut according to their fancy.\nTheir doublet was of cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, of velvet, satin,\ndamask, taffeties, &c., of the same colours, cut, embroidered, and suitably\ntrimmed up in perfection.  The points were of silk of the same colours; the\ntags were of gold well enamelled.  Their coats and jerkins were of cloth of\ngold, cloth of silver, gold, tissue or velvet embroidered, as they thought\nfit.  Their gowns were every whit as costly as those of the ladies.  Their\ngirdles were of silks, of the colour of their doublets.  Every one had a\ngallant sword by his side, the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and the\nscabbard of velvet, of the colour of his breeches, with a chape of gold,\nand pure goldsmith's work.  The dagger was of the same.  Their caps or\nbonnets were of black velvet, adorned with jewels and buttons of gold.\nUpon that they wore a white plume, most prettily and minion-like parted by\nso many rows of gold spangles, at the end whereof hung dangling in a more\nsparkling resplendency fair rubies, emeralds, diamonds, &c., but there was\nsuch a sympathy betwixt the gallants and the ladies, that every day they\nwere apparelled in the same livery.  And that they might not miss, there\nwere certain gentlemen appointed to tell the youths every morning what\nvestments the ladies would on that day wear:  for all was done according to\nthe pleasure of the ladies.  In these so handsome clothes, and habiliments\nso rich, think not that either one or other of either sex did waste any\ntime at all; for the masters of the wardrobes had all their raiments and\napparel so ready for every morning, and the chamber-ladies so well skilled,\nthat in a trice they would be dressed and completely in their clothes from\nhead to foot.  And to have those accoutrements with the more conveniency,\nthere was about the wood of Theleme a row of houses of the extent of half a\nleague, very neat and cleanly, wherein dwelt the goldsmiths, lapidaries,\njewellers, embroiderers, tailors, gold-drawers, velvet-weavers,\ntapestry-makers and upholsterers, who wrought there every one in his own\ntrade, and all for the aforesaid jolly friars and nuns of the new stamp.\nThey were furnished with matter and stuff from the hands of the Lord\nNausiclete, who every year brought them seven ships from the Perlas and\nCannibal Islands, laden with ingots of gold, with raw silk, with pearls and\nprecious stones. And if any margarites, called unions, began to grow old and\nlose somewhat of their natural whiteness and lustre, those with their art\nthey did renew by tendering them to eat to some pretty cocks, as they use to\ngive casting unto hawks.\n\n\n\n\nHow the Thelemites were governed, and of their manner of living.\n\nAll their life was spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but according to\ntheir own free will and pleasure.  They rose out of their beds when they\nthought good; they did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a mind to\nit and were disposed for it.  None did awake them, none did offer to\nconstrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any other thing; for so had\nGargantua established it.  In all their rule and strictest tie of their\norder there was but this one clause to be observed,\n\nDo What Thou Wilt;\n\nbecause men that are free, well-born, well-bred, and conversant in honest\ncompanies, have naturally an instinct and spur that prompteth them unto\nvirtuous actions, and withdraws them from vice, which is called honour.\nThose same men, when by base subjection and constraint they are brought\nunder and kept down, turn aside from that noble disposition by which they\nformerly were inclined to virtue, to shake off and break that bond of\nservitude wherein they are so tyrannously enslaved; for it is agreeable\nwith the nature of man to long after things forbidden and to desire what is\ndenied us.\n\nBy this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation to do all of\nthem what they saw did please one.  If any of the gallants or ladies should\nsay, Let us drink, they would all drink.  If any one of them said, Let us\nplay, they all played.  If one said, Let us go a-walking into the fields\nthey went all.  If it were to go a-hawking or a-hunting, the ladies mounted\nupon dainty well-paced nags, seated in a stately palfrey saddle, carried on\ntheir lovely fists, miniardly begloved every one of them, either a\nsparrowhawk or a laneret or a marlin, and the young gallants carried the\nother kinds of hawks.  So nobly were they taught, that there was neither he\nnor she amongst them but could read, write, sing, play upon several musical\ninstruments, speak five or six several languages, and compose in them all\nvery quaintly, both in verse and prose.  Never were seen so valiant\nknights, so noble and worthy, so dexterous and skilful both on foot and\na-horse-back, more brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better\nhandling all manner of weapons than were there.  Never were seen ladies so\nproper and handsome, so miniard and dainty, less froward, or more ready\nwith their hand and with their needle in every honest and free action\nbelonging to that sex, than were there.  For this reason, when the time\ncame that any man of the said abbey, either at the request of his parents,\nor for some other cause, had a mind to go out of it, he carried along with\nhim one of the ladies, namely, her whom he had before that chosen for his\nmistress, and (they) were married together.  And if they had formerly in\nTheleme lived in good devotion and amity, they did continue therein and\nincrease it to a greater height in their state of matrimony; and did\nentertain that mutual love till the very last day of their life, in no less\nvigour and fervency than at the very day of their wedding.  Here must not I\nforget to set down unto you a riddle which was found under the ground as\nthey were laying the foundation of the abbey, engraven in a copper plate,\nand it was thus as followeth.\n\n\n\n\nA prophetical Riddle.\n\nPoor mortals, who wait for a happy day,\nCheer up your hearts, and hear what I shall say:\nIf it be lawful firmly to believe\nThat the celestial bodies can us give\nWisdom to judge of things that are not yet;\nOr if from heaven such wisdom we may get\nAs may with confidence make us discourse\nOf years to come, their destiny and course;\nI to my hearers give to understand\nThat this next winter, though it be at hand,\nYea and before, there shall appear a race\nOf men who, loth to sit still in one place,\nShall boldly go before all people's eyes,\nSuborning men of divers qualities\nTo draw them unto covenants and sides,\nIn such a manner that, whate'er betides,\nThey'll move you, if you give them ear, no doubt,\nWith both your friends and kindred to fall out.\nThey'll make a vassal to gain-stand his lord,\nAnd children their own parents; in a word,\nAll reverence shall then be banished,\nNo true respect to other shall be had.\nThey'll say that every man should have his turn,\nBoth in his going forth and his return;\nAnd hereupon there shall arise such woes,\nSuch jarrings, and confused to's and fro's,\nThat never were in history such coils\nSet down as yet, such tumults and garboils.\nThen shall you many gallant men see by\nValour stirr'd up, and youthful fervency,\nWho, trusting too much in their hopeful time,\nLive but a while, and perish in their prime.\nNeither shall any, who this course shall run,\nLeave off the race which he hath once begun,\nTill they the heavens with noise by their contention\nHave fill'd, and with their steps the earth's dimension.\nThen those shall have no less authority,\nThat have no faith, than those that will not lie;\nFor all shall be governed by a rude,\nBase, ignorant, and foolish multitude;\nThe veriest lout of all shall be their judge,\nO horrible and dangerous deluge!\nDeluge I call it, and that for good reason,\nFor this shall be omitted in no season;\nNor shall the earth of this foul stir be free,\nTill suddenly you in great store shall see\nThe waters issue out, with whose streams the\nMost moderate of all shall moistened be,\nAnd justly too; because they did not spare\nThe flocks of beasts that innocentest are,\nBut did their sinews and their bowels take,\nNot to the gods a sacrifice to make,\nBut usually to serve themselves for sport:\nAnd now consider, I do you exhort,\nIn such commotions so continual,\nWhat rest can take the globe terrestrial?\nMost happy then are they, that can it hold,\nAnd use it carefully as precious gold,\nBy keeping it in gaol, whence it shall have\nNo help but him who being to it gave.\nAnd to increase his mournful accident,\nThe sun, before it set in th' occident,\nShall cease to dart upon it any light,\nMore than in an eclipse, or in the night,--\nSo that at once its favour shall be gone,\nAnd liberty with it be left alone.\nAnd yet, before it come to ruin thus,\nIts quaking shall be as impetuous\nAs Aetna's was when Titan's sons lay under,\nAnd yield, when lost, a fearful sound like thunder.\nInarime did not more quickly move,\nWhen Typheus did the vast huge hills remove,\nAnd for despite into the sea them threw.\n  Thus shall it then be lost by ways not few,\nAnd changed suddenly, when those that have it\nTo other men that after come shall leave it.\nThen shall it be high time to cease from this\nSo long, so great, so tedious exercise;\nFor the great waters told you now by me,\nWill make each think where his retreat shall be;\nAnd yet, before that they be clean disperst,\nYou may behold in th' air, where nought was erst,\nThe burning heat of a great flame to rise,\nLick up the water, and the enterprise.\n  It resteth after those things to declare,\nThat those shall sit content who chosen are,\nWith all good things, and with celestial man (ne,)\nAnd richly recompensed every man:\nThe others at the last all stripp'd shall be,\nThat after this great work all men may see,\nHow each shall have his due.  This is their lot;\nO he is worthy praise that shrinketh not!\n\nNo sooner was this enigmatical monument read over, but Gargantua, fetching\na very deep sigh, said unto those that stood by, It is not now only, I\nperceive, that people called to the faith of the gospel, and convinced with\nthe certainty of evangelical truths, are persecuted.  But happy is that man\nthat shall not be scandalized, but shall always continue to the end in\naiming at that mark which God by his dear Son hath set before us, without\nbeing distracted or diverted by his carnal affections and depraved nature.\n\nThe monk then said, What do you think in your conscience is meant and\nsignified by this riddle?  What? said Gargantua,--the progress and carrying\non of the divine truth.  By St. Goderan, said the monk, that is not my\nexposition.  It is the style of the prophet Merlin.  Make upon it as many\ngrave allegories and glosses as you will, and dote upon it you and the rest\nof the world as long as you please; for my part, I can conceive no other\nmeaning in it but a description of a set at tennis in dark and obscure\nterms.  The suborners of men are the makers of matches, which are commonly\nfriends.  After the two chases are made, he that was in the upper end of\nthe tennis-court goeth out, and the other cometh in.  They believe the\nfirst that saith the ball was over or under the line.  The waters are the\nheats that the players take till they sweat again.  The cords of the\nrackets are made of the guts of sheep or goats.  The globe terrestrial is\nthe tennis-ball.  After playing, when the game is done, they refresh\nthemselves before a clear fire, and change their shirts; and very willingly\nthey make all good cheer, but most merrily those that have gained.  And so,\nfarewell!\n\n\n\nEnd book 1\n\n\nTHE SECOND BOOK.\n\n\n\nFor the Reader.\n\nThe Reader here may be pleased to take notice that the copy of verses by\nthe title of 'Rablophila', premised to the first book of this translation,\nbeing but a kind of mock poem, in imitation of somewhat lately published\n(as to any indifferent observer will easily appear, by the false quantities\nin the Latin, the abusive strain of the English, and extravagant\nsubscription to both), and as such, by a friend of the translator's, at the\ndesire of some frolic gentlemen of his acquaintance, more for a trial of\nskill than prejudicacy to any, composed in his jollity to please their\nfancies, was only ordained to be prefixed to a dozen of books, and no more,\nthereby to save the labour of transcribing so many as were requisite for\nsatisfying the curiosity of a company of just that number; and that,\ntherefore, the charging of the whole impression with it is merely to be\nimputed to the negligence of the pressmen, who, receiving it about the\nlatter end of the night, were so eager before the next morning to afford\ncomplete books, that, as they began, they went on, without animadverting\nwhat was recommended to their discretion.  This is hoped will suffice to\nassure the ingenuous Reader that in no treatise of the translator's,\nwhether original or translatitious, shall willingly be offered the meanest\nrub to the reputation of any worthy gentleman, and that, however providence\ndispose of him, no misfortune shall be able to induce his mind to any\ncomplacency in the disparagement of another.\n\nAgain.\n\nThe Pentateuch of Rabelais mentioned in the title-page of the first book of\nthis translation being written originally in the French tongue (as it\ncomprehendeth some of its brusquest dialects), with so much ingeniosity and\nwit, that more impressions have been sold thereof in that language than of\nany other book that hath been set forth at any time within these fifteen\nhundred years; so difficult nevertheless to be turned into any other speech\nthat many prime spirits in most of the nations of Europe, since the year\n1573, which was fourscore years ago, after having attempted it, were\nconstrained with no small regret to give it over as a thing impossible to\nbe done, is now in its translation thus far advanced, and the remainder\nfaithfully undertaken with the same hand to be rendered into English by a\nperson of quality, who (though his lands be sequestered, his house\ngarrisoned, his other goods sold, and himself detained a prisoner of war at\nLondon, for his having been at Worcester fight) hath, at the most earnest\nentreaty of some of his especial friends well acquainted with his\ninclination to the performance of conducible singularities, promised,\nbesides his version of these two already published, very speedily to offer\nup unto this Isle of Britain the virginity of the translation of the other\nthree most admirable books of the aforesaid author; provided that by the\nplurality of judicious and understanding men it be not declared he hath\nalready proceeded too far, or that the continuation of the rigour whereby\nhe is dispossessed of all his both real and personal estate, by pressing\ntoo hard upon him, be not an impediment thereto, and to other more eminent\nundertakings of his, as hath been oftentimes very fully mentioned by the\nsaid translator in several original treatises of his own penning, lately by\nhim so numerously dispersed that there is scarce any, who being skilful in\nthe English idiom, or curious of any new ingenious invention, hath not\neither read them or heard of them.\n\n\n\nMr. Hugh Salel to Rabelais.\n\nIf profit mixed with pleasure may suffice\nT' extol an author's worth above the skies,\nThou certainly for both must praised be:\nI know it; for thy judgment hath in the\nContexture of this book set down such high\nContentments, mingled with utility,\nThat (as I think) I see Democritus\nLaughing at men as things ridiculous.\n    Insist in thy design; for, though we prove\n    Ungrate on earth, thy merit is above.\n\n\n\n","chapter_length":21125.0,"summary_name":"Book 1, Chapters 34-58","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180420203406\/http:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/gargantua-and-pantagruel\/study-guide\/summary-book-1-chapters-34-58","summary_text":"Gargantua and his men leave Paris and make way for Grangousier's kingdom. They find the land brutalized by Picrochole's armies. Through the help of powerful neighbors, they begin to plan an attack. Gargantua's friend, Gymnast, along with Prelingot, scout out the land to find out where the armies are located. In the midst of their scouting, they are surrounded by a platoon of soldiers. Gymnast feigns that he is possessed, performs horse tricks, and scares off most of the soldiers; then, he kills Captain Tripet, the captain of the soldiers. Upon arriving at the castle near the ford of Vede, Gargantua's horse urinates, and in doing so floods the land and over-floods the ford, which takes out a large portion of the enemy armies. To fight off the remaining enemies, Gargantua uproots a tree and fashions it into a lance. He moves to attack the castle, and the enemies within start to fire weapons of all sorts. Thanks to Gargantua's giant size, however, the bullets and cannon balls do not penetrate Gargantua's body. Gargantua takes his recently made lance and knocks over the castle, thus winning the battle. Gargantua and his company return to Grangousier's castle. Gargantua combs out his hair just prior to dinner, and out fall cannon balls and bullets, which Gargantua's father mistakes for lice. Ponocrates explains that as Gargantua's tutor and friend, he would never let him stay in a place so infested, and then Ponocrates proves that what has fallen from Gargantua's hair is indeed cannon balls and nothing more. After the battle, Grangousier provides a large feast. Gargantua craves a salad, and goes out to the garden to pick lettuce. Within the garden, however, six pilgrims from Picrochole's lands are hiding. They are afraid that they will be mistaken for spies, so they hide in Gargantua's garden; but since they are hiding so quietly, Gargantua does not see them, and picks them up with the heads of lettuce. He mixes them into a salad and nearly devours them, but the pilgrims are clever enough to grab hold of Gargantua's teeth, thus avoiding being swallowed. Gargantua picks out the pilgrims with a toothpick and flicks them aside, but Gargantua still does not see them. Gargantua then relieves himself, and in doing so his urine carries away the refuse, including the pilgrims. Gargantua and his company hear much about all the other skirmishes in the land. After hearing about Friar John, Gargantua wishes to meet the man, and so sends him a request for his company. Friar John arrives and is welcomed with much warmth by Gargantua. Friar John then sits, eats, and drinks with Gargantua, Grangousier, Eudemon, Gymnast, and Ponocrates. The men joke, discuss the war, talk about why people dislike monks, and then discuss how Friar John's nose acquired its particular shape. The next day, Gargantua and his company, joined by Friar John, make their way into battle. Friar John uses great words to motivate the company, but as he talks he neglects to pay attention to his surroundings, and accidentally gets stuck in a tree. Luckily, Gymnast and the others help him out. During the battle, Gargantua and his fellows, along with a small army, realize that they may be outnumbered, but that Picrochole's armies are untrained and undisciplined. Friar John loudly encourages his comrades to fight, regardless of the size of the enemy, but in doing so he gives away their location. The battle ensues. In the midst of battle, Friar John gets captured, but kills his captors and takes one of the enemy's leaders, Touchfaucet, as his prisoner. Gargantua and his company, including Friar John and his prisoner, return to Grangousier's castle. Grangousier explains to Touchfaucet that he will be set free, but that he must encourage his master to stop this war. Touchfaucet returns to Picrochole and begs him to negotiate peace, but to no avail. Touchfaucet is called a traitor, kills one of the other military captains, Rashcalf, and then Picrochole orders his guards to kill Touchfaucet. As the war continues, surrounding countries pledge loyalty to Grangousier, since they know that Picrochole fights unjustly without cause. Grangousier thanks all who have pledged loyalty to him, but he announces that he wishes to end the conflict quickly without wasting more lives. Meanwhile, Picrochole's armies are losing morale, as they hear word about how Grangousier's army is growing. In addition, Picrochole's armies are running out of food and supplies. Grangousier, Gargantua, and Gargantua's friends decide that they must plan a strategy that will end the war immediately. They position their armies to flank and surround their enemies. Friar John leads a battalion and manages to capture a large portion of Picrochole's army. Gargantua and his armies attack Picrochole directly; in the chaos of war, however, Picrochole, his servants, and his armies retreat, leaving Gargantua and his followers as the victors. With the war clearly over, Picrochole runs away, becomes separated from his people, and finds himself alone. He tries to find his way back, but ends up being beaten, his clothes ripped into shreds. According to rumor, he ends up a lowly porter in some other kingdom. Gargantua announces his victory with a humble story about one of his father's previous enemies, King Alpharbal. Like Picrochole, King Alpharbal was obsessed with conquest and pillaging. Upon being captured, Grangousier did not enslave or beat his enemy, and instead treated him with great kindness and allowed him to go home. King Alpharbal was so amazed by such kindness that he forever swore loyalty to Grangousier. Therefore, Gargantua announces that he will treat their current prisoners with the same kindness. Since Picrochole is nowhere to be found, and therefore cannot run his kingdom, ownership of the kingdom will fall upon Picrochole's son, who is too young to rule. To protect Picrochole's son, Gargantua appoints Ponocrates as the steward\/governor of the land, until such time that Picrochole's son may rule. Gargantua awards each of his friends and servants, , with lands, titles, and castles, as a way to thank them for joining him in battle. To reward Friar John, he offers him dominion over some of the more famous abbeys, to which Friar John cannot accept, for he finds those abbeys corrupt, and requests the ability to build a different kind of abbey, which he names the Abbey of Thelme. Designed and constructed under the guidance of the Gargantua and Friar John, the Abbey of Thelme would be like no other abbey before it. The only rule of the abbey would be to \"do as thou wilt,\" implying that no one shall keep time, and that everyone would be free to live their lives as they wish. It would have no walls, for walls create conspiracy. The abbey would house both men and women, and it would allow the men and women to fraternize and even be married to one another. Many women would be educated here in a mostly egalitarian fashion, although certain chores and duties would still be assigned as gender-specific. The entire abbey would be built like an immaculate castle, and the persons living within would be garbed in decadent clothing. The narrator describes that even though these people would live very well, that they somehow would not allow such a decadent form of living to corrupt them or take up their time in a negative fashion. While they would be allowed to do what they wish, they must do so in accordance with leading good, noble, and productive lives. Upon breaking ground for the construction of the abbey, Gargantua and Friar John find a riddle carved into a piece of copper. Gargantua interprets the riddle as a religious metaphor, namely that individuals must seek out God and not allow earthly matters to drag them down to vice. Friar John, on the other hand, does not interpret the riddle as such. Instead, he interprets the poem more basely as the description of a tennis match. According to Friar John, players go against their opponents, as friends or enemies arrange matches. After each match, the players rest, refresh themselves, and then make themselves ready to play again. Those who win their matches are exceedingly happy, but even those who lose are still happy to some degree.","summary_analysis":"The climax of book one occurs in the second half of the story. Gargantua and his comrades take part in several battles. As they do so, the narrator goes into further detail concerning the characterization of the supporting characters. Gymnast, for example, appears in the first half of the book as a man skilled in horseback riding and military strategy. In the battlefield, we witness his knowledge put to the test. Not only does he use strategy to scout out the enemy, but he also proves his ability to be a great judge of character. Through watching the enemy, he establishes that the enemy soldiers lack discipline. Gymnast also realizes that these undisciplined soldiers are naive and subject to superstitious fear. When captured, Gymnast cleverly feigns demon possession to throw his assailants off-guard and to win the day. The further characterization of Friar John continues the seemingly split personality of the silly monk and the warrior monk. In preparing for battle, though, the silly monk becomes full of bravado. His overconfidence satirically mocks the clergy and, to some degree, the military, since it demonstrates how soldiers and leaders preparing for war become so focused and excited that they become blind to their surroundings. In the case of Friar John, as he tries to encourage Gargantua and his compatriots, Friar John somehow manages to get himself hung up in a tree and unable to proceed. He also talks too loudly at times, giving their position away to the enemy. After so many military blunders, Friar John gets captured and taken away, but that is when the warrior monk comes out. Oddly enough, Friar John's warrior abilities seem most pronounced when he stands separate from his associates. Even in the final battle, he fights and captures a battalion far removed from where Gargantua and the others are fighting. From the point of view of the writer, Rabelais may have felt that without someone playing the role of comedic relief that his story would have gone out of satire and into the realm of comedic drama. That could explain why Friar John's character leans toward the silly monk persona when he is in the company Gargantua has compatriots. After the war is over and Picrochole's armies are defeated, Rabelais uses a clever flashback strategy to explain the ideals of Utopia, Gargantua's homeland. Within the flashback, Gargantua tells the story about one of his father's previous enemies, Alpharbal, and how his father treated his enemy with compassion instead of malice. That compassion was rewarded with Alpharbal swearing lifelong allegiance to Grangousier. As an exposition, the flashback serves two purposes. First of all, it further establishes Grangousier as a kind and pacifistic ruler, regardless of his hedonistic ways in the beginning of the book. The flashback also foreshadows how Gargantua will run his kingdom and how he will train his son to rule. To further establish how Gargantua will run his kingdom, he and Friar John get into a conversation about how to redesign the ideal abbey. However, this conversation about the Abbey of Thelme is peculiarly juxtaposed against the character of Picrochole, the warmongering king. In her article, \"Was Picrochole Free? Rabelais between Luther and Erasmus,\" Eva Kushner discusses this strange pairing of topics. She points out how Gargantua and Friar John foresee that the Abbey of Thelme will house the most skilled and virtuous men and women in the land, and since they are born of noble birth, it will be in their nature to remain peaceful and dedicated to God. This very statement implies that those of nobility have an innate nature to act in a particular way. As Kushner explains, Picrochole is an educated man of noble birth, and yet he started a war without sufficient evidence. Worse than not, he refused to negotiate and would not listen to reason. Kushner posits that Rabelais's purpose behind these contradicting elements is to promote a satirical methodology showcasing how the ideals of Thelme may not hold true in the real world, since \"a man, who is furthermore endowed with royal power, will misuse his freedom and ignore that of other men,\" . Therefore, a place such as Thelme cannot function to the extent of the ideals dreamed by Gargantua and Friar John, unless such a place remains outside of the control of monarchies. Even then, whoever possesses decision-making power over Thelme, presumably Friar John, may also be susceptible to the corrupting forces of absolute power.","summary_length":1373.0,"analysis_length":742.0,"chap_int":58,"previous summary id":[],"previous chapter":[],"next summary id":"book 1, chapters 34-58","next chapter":"Gargantua and his men leave Paris and make way for Grangousier's kingdom. They find the land brutalized by Picrochole's armies. Through the help of powerful neighbors, they begin to plan an attack. Gargantua's friend, Gymnast, along with Prelingot, scout out the land to find out where the armies are located. In the midst of their scouting, they are surrounded by a platoon of soldiers. Gymnast feigns that he is possessed, performs horse tricks, and scares off most of the soldiers; then, he kills Captain Tripet, the captain of the soldiers. Upon arriving at the castle near the ford of Vede, Gargantua's horse urinates, and in doing so floods the land and over-floods the ford, which takes out a large portion of the enemy armies. To fight off the remaining enemies, Gargantua uproots a tree and fashions it into a lance. He moves to attack the castle, and the enemies within start to fire weapons of all sorts. Thanks to Gargantua's giant size, however, the bullets and cannon balls do not penetrate Gargantua's body. Gargantua takes his recently made lance and knocks over the castle, thus winning the battle. Gargantua and his company return to Grangousier's castle. Gargantua combs out his hair just prior to dinner, and out fall cannon balls and bullets, which Gargantua's father mistakes for lice. Ponocrates explains that as Gargantua's tutor and friend, he would never let him stay in a place so infested, and then Ponocrates proves that what has fallen from Gargantua's hair is indeed cannon balls and nothing more. After the battle, Grangousier provides a large feast. Gargantua craves a salad, and goes out to the garden to pick lettuce. Within the garden, however, six pilgrims from Picrochole's lands are hiding. They are afraid that they will be mistaken for spies, so they hide in Gargantua's garden; but since they are hiding so quietly, Gargantua does not see them, and picks them up with the heads of lettuce. He mixes them into a salad and nearly devours them, but the pilgrims are clever enough to grab hold of Gargantua's teeth, thus avoiding being swallowed. Gargantua picks out the pilgrims with a toothpick and flicks them aside, but Gargantua still does not see them. Gargantua then relieves himself, and in doing so his urine carries away the refuse, including the pilgrims. Gargantua and his company hear much about all the other skirmishes in the land. After hearing about Friar John, Gargantua wishes to meet the man, and so sends him a request for his company. Friar John arrives and is welcomed with much warmth by Gargantua. Friar John then sits, eats, and drinks with Gargantua, Grangousier, Eudemon, Gymnast, and Ponocrates. The men joke, discuss the war, talk about why people dislike monks, and then discuss how Friar John's nose acquired its particular shape. The next day, Gargantua and his company, joined by Friar John, make their way into battle. Friar John uses great words to motivate the company, but as he talks he neglects to pay attention to his surroundings, and accidentally gets stuck in a tree. Luckily, Gymnast and the others help him out. During the battle, Gargantua and his fellows, along with a small army, realize that they may be outnumbered, but that Picrochole's armies are untrained and undisciplined.

The scene is Vanya's room, which is also the estate office. There is a map of Africa, a small table for Astrov, and a cage with a starling. Telegin and Marina are sitting in the office, discussing how Serebryakov and Helen are going to live in Kharkov. They both think this is a good thing, especially after Vanya's disgraceful behavior. Marina is looking forward to things going back to normal. Telegin sighs that he is looking forward to this. Marina smiles at Telegin when the old man confesses he hid the pistol in the cellar. Vanya and Astrov enter. Vanya is irritable, and orders Marina and Telegin out. They comply. Vanya tells Astrov to leave; Astrov says that he will, and with pleasure, but only when Vanya gives him back what is his. Vanya is confused, but Astrov stubbornly stands his ground. Vanya rues the fact that he missed the professor twice, and Astrov asks why he didn't just shoot himself if he had to shoot someone. Vanya shrugs. He wonders if they think he is mad, for he just tried to kill someone and he isn't arrested or in jail. He sneers that people can dress themselves up as professors or marry old men, yet no one thinks they are mad. He looks at Astrov and tells him that he saw him kiss Helen. Astrov admits this and thumbs his nose at Vanya. He calls Vanya an old clown and says he simply has no sense. Vanya hangs his head and says that the feeling of shame he has is worse than pain. He wonders what he is to do. Astrov replies that he can do nothing. Vanya laments his age and how he is to live the rest of the years of his life. He wishes that he could wake up one day with a fresh start. Astrov is annoyed with him and states that both of their lives are hopeless. Vanya points to his own chest and asks for something. Astrov shouts at him to shut up, but then more gently says that their only hope is to have pleasant visions once they're in their graves. He and Vanya are the only civilized people in their district, but the parochial existence ruined them and \\\"poisoned our blood and we've become as second-rate as the rest of them\\\" . After a moment, Astrov repeats his claim that Vanya took something from him: a bottle of morphia out of his medical case. If Vanya wants to do himself in, he might as well go into the woods and shoot himself, but Astrov can't have people thinking he gave Vanya the bottle. Sonya enters, and Astrov tells her she needs to tell her uncle to give him back the morphia. She looks at Vanya and asks if he took it, then moves toward him and tells him affectionately that he has to give it back. He cannot give into despair; he should be patient. She weeps and holds his hands; Vanya gives in and returns the bottle, saying he must get back to work. Helen enters and tells Vanya that Serebryakov wants a word with him. Vanya and Sonya depart. Helen gives Astrov her hand and says goodbye. Astrov asks her once more about the forest reservation tomorrow; she tells him flatly that it is ended and they are leaving. Astrov makes an impatient gesture and says she has nothing else to do, no object in life, and no occupations; thus, she ought to stay in this rather romantic place. Helen replies that he is absurd, but that she will remember him fondly because he is interesting and different from the others. They shake hands and Astrov says that, yes, she had better leave. She and her husband riled up the place and infected them all with their idleness. Astrov jokes that they bring havoc wherever they go. Helen picks up a pencil and says she will take it to remember him by. He is amused that they will never see each other again. Helen kisses him on the cheek, then impulsively kisses him on the lips and wishes him happiness. Everyone else enters. Serebryakov wishes Vanya the best, and they formally kiss three times in parting. Everyone in the group exchanges farewells, and Serebryakov urges them to get down to work. Helen kisses Vanya on the head and leaves. Serebryakov follows, asking Telegin to get their carriage. Vanya starts rifling through his papers, commenting that he is depressed and must get to work immediately. Outside bells sound, and Astrov comments that they are gone. Marina enters and sits down to knit a sock. Sonya enters and tells her uncle they should get to work. She lights the lamp and sighs that she is sad that they've gone. She and Vanya start to work. Astrov comments that it is quiet and peaceful here, and Marina suggests that he should stay. He says he cannot, and at that moment a laborer comes in and says his carriage is ready. Sonya stands to say goodbye and asks when he will return. He replies that he won't return any earlier than next summer. Marina offers him some vodka; he takes it and then leaves. Outside, harness bells are heard and Marina comments that Astrov is gone. Telegin strums quietly on his guitar while Sonya and Vanya write. Vanya tells his niece that he is so depressed. She looks at him with compassion and says that life will go on. It will be long, tiring, and they will never have peace; beyond the grave, though, they will know that although they wept, suffered, and their lot was bitter, God will pity them and they will have another life of beauty, light, and joy. Sonya kneels before her uncle and tells him softly multiple times that they will have peace, they will see the angels, they will experience a flood of mercy, and they will have a calm, gentle, and sweet life. Vanya hasn't had any happiness yet, but he will in the future. Sonya reaches up to wipe his tears away and tells him again that they will find peace.\", \"analysis\": \"The fourth and final act of Uncle Vanya is, to say the least, anticlimactic ). Helen stays faithful to Serebryakov, and both of them depart the estate. Serebryakov is just as shortsighted, pompous, and self-absorbed as he was prior to his departure, and Helen is just as bored and unhappy. Helen and Astrov kiss, but it is perfunctory and passionless. The unmarried Sonya returns to work, as do Marina and Telegin. Astrov leaves for the season, just as simultaneously hopeful and cynical as he was earlier. As for Vanya, he has further revealed himself to be ridiculous. His complaints, his demonization of Serebryakov, his lack of personal insight, his attempt to seduce Helen, and the attempted murder \\\"make him comically pathetic rather than tragically heroic,\\\" as critic Geoffrey Borny writes. His exclamation that he could have been the inimitable Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky ultimately comes across as petulant and inane rather than as a legitimate woe. Overall, no one seems to have learned any lessons or decided to alter their current state of existence. Critic Jane Anderson writes, \\\" must live without the illusions of their hopes. Each must once again take up the stifling trifles of daily life to distract themselves from their lives of quiet desperation.\\\" Chekhov himself once wrote, \\\"In spite of all my attempts at being serious, the result is noting; with me the serious always alternates with the trivial.\\\" Critic John Weston lauds the confluence of serious and trivial, and he doesn't lay the blame entirely at the characters' feet. He writes, \\\"it is not so much the personal defects of character that cause unhappiness as it is the pressures and tensions of everyday country life created by economic and social conditions of the time. It is the boring, stupefying, and vulgar life in the country which drags down intelligent people like Astrov and Uncle Vanya and Sonya and Serebryakov to the level of pettiness and selfishness.\\\" Finally, Sonya's speech to Vanya merits analysis. She imitates the sentiments Marina conveyed to Astrov at the beginning of the play--that God will remember them. For Sonya, life is indeed hard work with little recognition, but it is the hope of an afterlife that sustains her. She tells her uncle, \\\"In the world beyond the grave we shall say we have wept and suffered, that our lot was harsh and bitter, and God will have pity on us. And you and I, Uncle, shall behold a life which is bright and beautiful and splendid\\\" . Sonya's religious faith allows her to genuinely comfort her uncle, as well as to prop herself up after learning that Astrov does not love her. Sadly, though, there is no evidence that Vanya shares his niece's faith. He merely sobs while she tries to comfort him. Borny notes, \\\"Sonya's long speech of faith at the end of the play is undercut by the fact that she is preaching to the unconverted. Vanya appears to have little faith in the existence of Sonya's God, and even though he has now resumed working, he no longer has faith in the value of work.\\\" Vanya will most likely get back to a place where he finds value in work, but it may take a long time and will be liable to disruption again.\"}","chapter":"ACT IV\n\nVOITSKI'S bedroom, which is also his office. A table stands near\nthe window; on it are ledgers, letter scales, and papers of every\ndescription. Near by stands a smaller table belonging to ASTROFF, with\nhis paints and drawing materials. On the wall hangs a cage containing a\nstarling. There is also a map of Africa on the wall, obviously of no use\nto anybody. There is a large sofa covered with buckram. A door to the\nleft leads into an inner room; one to the right leads into the front\nhall, and before this door lies a mat for the peasants with their muddy\nboots to stand on. It is an autumn evening. The silence is profound.\nTELEGIN and MARINA are sitting facing one another, winding wool.\n\nTELEGIN. Be quick, Marina, or we shall be called away to say good-bye\nbefore you have finished. The carriage has already been ordered.\n\nMARINA. [Trying to wind more quickly] I am a little tired.\n\nTELEGIN. They are going to Kharkoff to live.\n\nMARINA. They do well to go.\n\nTELEGIN. They have been frightened. The professor's wife won't stay here\nan hour longer. \"If we are going at all, let's be off,\" says she, \"we\nshall go to Kharkoff and look about us, and then we can send for our\nthings.\" They are travelling light. It seems, Marina, that fate has\ndecreed for them not to live here.\n\nMARINA. And quite rightly. What a storm they have just raised! It was\nshameful!\n\nTELEGIN. It was indeed. The scene was worthy of the brush of Aibazofski.\n\nMARINA. I wish I'd never laid eyes on them. [A pause] Now we shall have\nthings as they were again: tea at eight, dinner at one, and supper in\nthe evening; everything in order as decent folks, as Christians like to\nhave it. [Sighs] It is a long time since I have eaten noodles.\n\nTELEGIN. Yes, we haven't had noodles for ages. [A pause] Not for ages.\nAs I was going through the village this morning, Marina, one of the\nshop-keepers called after me, \"Hi! you hanger-on!\" I felt it bitterly.\n\nMARINA. Don't pay the least attention to them, master; we are all\ndependents on God. You and Sonia and all of us. Every one must work, no\none can sit idle. Where is Sonia?\n\nTELEGIN. In the garden with the doctor, looking for Ivan. They fear he\nmay lay violent hands on himself.\n\nMARINA. Where is his pistol?\n\nTELEGIN. [Whispers] I hid it in the cellar.\n\nVOITSKI and ASTROFF come in.\n\nVOITSKI. Leave me alone! [To MARINA and TELEGIN] Go away! Go away and\nleave me to myself, if but for an hour. I won't have you watching me\nlike this!\n\nTELEGIN. Yes, yes, Vanya. [He goes out on tiptoe.]\n\nMARINA. The gander cackles; ho! ho! ho!\n\n[She gathers up her wool and goes out.]\n\nVOITSKI. Leave me by myself!\n\nASTROFF. I would, with the greatest pleasure. I ought to have gone long\nago, but I shan't leave you until you have returned what you took from\nme.\n\nVOITSKI. I took nothing from you.\n\nASTROFF. I am not jesting, don't detain me, I really must go.\n\nVOITSKI. I took nothing of yours.\n\nASTROFF. You didn't? Very well, I shall have to wait a little longer,\nand then you will have to forgive me if I resort to force. We shall have\nto bind you and search you. I mean what I say.\n\nVOITSKI. Do as you please. [A pause] Oh, to make such a fool of myself!\nTo shoot twice and miss him both times! I shall never forgive myself.\n\nASTROFF. When the impulse came to shoot, it would have been as well had\nyou put a bullet through your own head.\n\nVOITSKI. [Shrugging his shoulders] Strange! I attempted murder, and am\nnot going to be arrested or brought to trial. That means they think\nme mad. [With a bitter laugh] Me! I am mad, and those who hide their\nworthlessness, their dullness, their crying heartlessness behind a\nprofessor's mask, are sane! Those who marry old men and then deceive\nthem under the noses of all, are sane! I saw you kiss her; I saw you in\neach other's arms!\n\nASTROFF. Yes, sir, I did kiss her; so there. [He puts his thumb to his\nnose.]\n\nVOITSKI. [His eyes on the door] No, it is the earth that is mad, because\nshe still bears us on her breast.\n\nASTROFF. That is nonsense.\n\nVOITSKI. Well? Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible? Haven't I\nthe right to talk nonsense?\n\nASTROFF. This is a farce! You are not mad; you are simply a ridiculous\nfool. I used to think every fool was out of his senses, but now I\nsee that lack of sense is a man's normal state, and you are perfectly\nnormal.\n\nVOITSKI. [Covers his face with his hands] Oh! If you knew how ashamed\nI am! These piercing pangs of shame are like nothing on earth. [In an\nagonised voice] I can't endure them! [He leans against the table] What\ncan I do? What can I do?\n\nASTROFF. Nothing.\n\nVOITSKI. You must tell me something! Oh, my God! I am forty-seven years\nold. I may live to sixty; I still have thirteen years before me; an\neternity! How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?\nWhat shall I do? How can I fill them? Oh, don't you see? [He presses\nASTROFF'S hand convulsively] Don't you see, if only I could live the\nrest of my life in some new way! If I could only wake some still, bright\nmorning and feel that life had begun again; that the past was forgotten\nand had vanished like smoke. [He weeps] Oh, to begin life anew! Tell me,\ntell me how to begin.\n\nASTROFF. [Crossly] What nonsense! What sort of a new life can you and I\nlook forward to? We can have no hope.\n\nVOITSKI. None?\n\nASTROFF. None. Of that I am convinced.\n\nVOITSKI. Tell me what to do. [He puts his hand to his heart] I feel such\na burning pain here.\n\nASTROFF. [Shouts angrily] Stop! [Then, more gently] It may be that\nposterity, which will despise us for our blind and stupid lives, will\nfind some road to happiness; but we--you and I--have but one hope, the\nhope that we may be visited by visions, perhaps by pleasant ones, as we\nlie resting in our graves. [Sighing] Yes, brother, there were only two\nrespectable, intelligent men in this county, you and I. Ten years or so\nof this life of ours, this miserable life, have sucked us under, and we\nhave become as contemptible and petty as the rest. But don't try to talk\nme out of my purpose! Give me what you took from me, will you?\n\nVOITSKI. I took nothing from you.\n\nASTROFF. You took a little bottle of morphine out of my medicine-case.\n[A pause] Listen! If you are positively determined to make an end\nto yourself, go into the woods and shoot yourself there. Give up the\nmorphine, or there will be a lot of talk and guesswork; people will\nthink I gave it to you. I don't fancy having to perform a post-mortem on\nyou. Do you think I should find it interesting?\n\nSONIA comes in.\n\nVOITSKI. Leave me alone.\n\nASTROFF. [To SONIA] Sonia, your uncle has stolen a bottle of morphine\nout of my medicine-case and won't give it up. Tell him that his\nbehaviour is--well, unwise. I haven't time, I must be going.\n\nSONIA. Uncle Vanya, did you take the morphine?\n\nASTROFF. Yes, he took it. [A pause] I am absolutely sure.\n\nSONIA. Give it up! Why do you want to frighten us? [Tenderly] Give it\nup, Uncle Vanya! My misfortune is perhaps even greater than yours, but I\nam not plunged in despair. I endure my sorrow, and shall endure it until\nmy life comes to a natural end. You must endure yours, too. [A pause]\nGive it up! Dear, darling Uncle Vanya. Give it up! [She weeps] You are\nso good, I am sure you will have pity on us and give it up. You must\nendure your sorrow, Uncle Vanya; you must endure it.\n\nVOITSKI takes a bottle from the drawer of the table and hands it to\nASTROFF.\n\nVOITSKI. There it is! [To SONIA] And now, we must get to work at once;\nwe must do something, or else I shall not be able to endure it.\n\nSONIA. Yes, yes, to work! As soon as we have seen them off we shall\ngo to work. [She nervously straightens out the papers on the table]\nEverything is in a muddle!\n\nASTROFF. [Putting the bottle in his case, which he straps together] Now\nI can be off.\n\nHELENA comes in.\n\nHELENA. Are you here, Ivan? We are starting in a moment. Go to\nAlexander, he wants to speak to you.\n\nSONIA. Go, Uncle Vanya. [She takes VOITSKI 'S arm] Come, you and papa\nmust make peace; that is absolutely necessary.\n\nSONIA and VOITSKI go out.\n\nHELENA. I am going away. [She gives ASTROFF her hand] Good-bye.\n\nASTROFF. So soon?\n\nHELENA. The carriage is waiting.\n\nASTROFF. Good-bye.\n\nHELENA. You promised me you would go away yourself to-day.\n\nASTROFF. I have not forgotten. I am going at once. [A pause] Were you\nfrightened? Was it so terrible?\n\nHELENA. Yes.\n\nASTROFF. Couldn't you stay? Couldn't you? To-morrow--in the forest--\n\nHELENA. No. It is all settled, and that is why I can look you so bravely\nin the face. Our departure is fixed. One thing I must ask of you: don't\nthink too badly of me; I should like you to respect me.\n\nASTROFF. Ah! [With an impatient gesture] Stay, I implore you! Confess\nthat there is nothing for you to do in this world. You have no object\nin life; there is nothing to occupy your attention, and sooner or later\nyour feelings must master you. It is inevitable. It would be better if\nit happened not in Kharkoff or in Kursk, but here, in nature's lap.\nIt would then at least be poetical, even beautiful. Here you have the\nforests, the houses half in ruins that Turgenieff writes of.\n\nHELENA. How comical you are! I am angry with you and yet I shall always\nremember you with pleasure. You are interesting and original. You and\nI will never meet again, and so I shall tell you--why should I conceal\nit?--that I am just a little in love with you. Come, one more last\npressure of our hands, and then let us part good friends. Let us not\nbear each other any ill will.\n\nASTROFF. [Pressing her hand] Yes, go. [Thoughtfully] You seem to be\nsincere and good, and yet there is something strangely disquieting about\nall your personality. No sooner did you arrive here with your husband\nthan every one whom you found busy and actively creating something was\nforced to drop his work and give himself up for the whole summer to\nyour husband's gout and yourself. You and he have infected us with your\nidleness. I have been swept off my feet; I have not put my hand to\na thing for weeks, during which sickness has been running its course\nunchecked among the people, and the peasants have been pasturing their\ncattle in my woods and young plantations. Go where you will, you and\nyour husband will always carry destruction in your train. I am joking of\ncourse, and yet I am strangely sure that had you stayed here we should\nhave been overtaken by the most immense desolation. I would have gone\nto my ruin, and you--you would not have prospered. So go! E finita la\ncomedia!\n\nHELENA. [Snatching a pencil off ASTROFF'S table, and hiding it with a\nquick movement] I shall take this pencil for memory!\n\nASTROFF. How strange it is. We meet, and then suddenly it seems that\nwe must part forever. That is the way in this world. As long as we are\nalone, before Uncle Vanya comes in with a bouquet--allow me--to kiss you\ngood-bye--may I? [He kisses her on the cheek] So! Splendid!\n\nHELENA. I wish you every happiness. [She glances about her] For once\nin my life, I shall! and scorn the consequences! [She kisses him\nimpetuously, and they quickly part] I must go.\n\nASTROFF. Yes, go. If the carriage is there, then start at once. [They\nstand listening.]\n\nASTROFF. E finita!\n\nVOITSKI, SEREBRAKOFF, MME. VOITSKAYA with her book, TELEGIN, and SONIA\ncome in.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [To VOITSKI] Shame on him who bears malice for the past. I\nhave gone through so much in the last few hours that I feel capable of\nwriting a whole treatise on the conduct of life for the instruction\nof posterity. I gladly accept your apology, and myself ask your\nforgiveness. [He kisses VOITSKI three times.]\n\nHELENA embraces SONIA.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [Kissing MME. VOITSKAYA'S hand] Mother!\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA. [Kissing him] Have your picture taken, Alexander, and\nsend me one. You know how dear you are to me.\n\nTELEGIN. Good-bye, your Excellency. Don't forget us.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [Kissing his daughter] Good-bye, good-bye all. [Shaking\nhands with ASTROFF] Many thanks for your pleasant company. I have a deep\nregard for your opinions and your enthusiasm, but let me, as an old man,\ngive one word of advice at parting: do something, my friend! Work! Do\nsomething! [They all bow] Good luck to you all. [He goes out followed by\nMME. VOITSKAYA and SONIA.]\n\nVOITSKI [Kissing HELENA'S hand fervently] Good-bye--forgive me. I shall\nnever see you again!\n\nHELENA. [Touched] Good-bye, dear boy.\n\nShe lightly kisses his head as he bends over her hand, and goes out.\n\nASTROFF. Tell them to bring my carriage around too, Waffles.\n\nTELEGIN. All right, old man.\n\nASTROFF and VOITSKI are left behind alone. ASTROFF collects his paints\nand drawing materials on the table and packs them away in a box.\n\nASTROFF. Why don't you go to see them off?\n\nVOITSKI. Let them go! I--I can't go out there. I feel too sad. I must go\nto work on something at once. To work! To work!\n\nHe rummages through his papers on the table. A pause. The tinkling of\nbells is heard as the horses trot away.\n\nASTROFF. They have gone! The professor, I suppose, is glad to go. He\ncouldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.\n\nMARINA comes in.\n\nMARINA. They have gone. [She sits down in an arm-chair and knits her\nstocking.]\n\nSONIA comes in wiping her eyes.\n\nSONIA. They have gone. God be with them. [To her uncle] And now, Uncle\nVanya, let us do something!\n\nVOITSKI. To work! To work!\n\nSONIA. It is long, long, since you and I have sat together at this\ntable. [She lights a lamp on the table] No ink! [She takes the inkstand\nto the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle] How sad it is to see\nthem go!\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA comes slowly in.\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA. They have gone.\n\nShe sits down and at once becomes absorbed in her book. SONIA sits down\nat the table and looks through an account book.\n\nSONIA. First, Uncle Vanya, let us write up the accounts. They are in a\ndreadful state. Come, begin. You take one and I will take the other.\n\nVOITSKI. In account with [They sit silently writing.]\n\nMARINA. [Yawning] The sand-man has come.\n\nASTROFF. How still it is. Their pens scratch, the cricket sings; it is\nso warm and comfortable. I hate to go. [The tinkling of bells is heard.]\n\nASTROFF. My carriage has come. There now remains but to say good-bye to\nyou, my friends, and to my table here, and then--away! [He puts the map\ninto the portfolio.]\n\nMARINA. Don't hurry away; sit a little longer with us.\n\nASTROFF. Impossible.\n\nVOITSKI. [Writing] And carry forward from the old debt two\nseventy-five--\n\nWORKMAN comes in.\n\nWORKMAN. Your carriage is waiting, sir.\n\nASTROFF. All right. [He hands the WORKMAN his medicine-case, portfolio,\nand box] Look out, don't crush the portfolio!\n\nWORKMAN. Very well, sir.\n\nSONIA. When shall we see you again?\n\nASTROFF. Hardly before next summer. Probably not this winter, though, of\ncourse, if anything should happen you will let me know. [He shakes\nhands with them] Thank you for your kindness, for your hospitality, for\neverything! [He goes up to MARINA and kisses her head] Good-bye, old\nnurse!\n\nMARINA. Are you going without your tea?\n\nASTROFF. I don't want any, nurse.\n\nMARINA. Won't you have a drop of vodka?\n\nASTROFF. [Hesitatingly] Yes, I might.\n\nMARINA goes out.\n\nASTROFF. [After a pause] My off-wheeler has gone lame for some reason. I\nnoticed it yesterday when Peter was taking him to water.\n\nVOITSKI. You should have him re-shod.\n\nASTROFF. I shall have to go around by the blacksmith's on my way home.\nIt can't be avoided. [He stands looking up at the map of Africa hanging\non the wall] I suppose it is roasting hot in Africa now.\n\nVOITSKI. Yes, I suppose it is.\n\nMARINA comes back carrying a tray on which are a glass of vodka and a\npiece of bread.\n\nMARINA. Help yourself.\n\nASTROFF drinks\n\nMARINA. To your good health! [She bows deeply] Eat your bread with it.\n\nASTROFF. No, I like it so. And now, good-bye. [To MARINA] You needn't\ncome out to see me off, nurse.\n\nHe goes out. SONIA follows him with a candle to light him to the\ncarriage. MARINA sits down in her armchair.\n\nVOITSKI. [Writing] On the 2d of February, twenty pounds of butter; on\nthe 16th, twenty pounds of butter again. Buckwheat flour--[A pause.\nBells are heard tinkling.]\n\nMARINA. He has gone. [A pause.]\n\nSONIA comes in and sets the candle stick on the table.\n\nSONIA. He has gone.\n\nVOITSKI. [Adding and writing] Total, fifteen--twenty-five--\n\nSONIA sits down and begins to write.\n\n[Yawning] Oh, ho! The Lord have mercy.\n\nTELEGIN comes in on tiptoe, sits down near the door, and begins to tune\nhis guitar.\n\nVOITSKI. [To SONIA, stroking her hair] Oh, my child, I am miserable; if\nyou only knew how miserable I am!\n\nSONIA. What can we do? We must live our lives. [A pause] Yes, we shall\nlive, Uncle Vanya. We shall live through the long procession of days\nbefore us, and through the long evenings; we shall patiently bear the\ntrials that fate imposes on us; we shall work for others without rest,\nboth now and when we are old; and when our last hour comes we shall\nmeet it humbly, and there, beyond the grave, we shall say that we have\nsuffered and wept, that our life was bitter, and God will have pity on\nus. Ah, then dear, dear Uncle, we shall see that bright and beautiful\nlife; we shall rejoice and look back upon our sorrow here; a tender\nsmile--and--we shall rest. I have faith, Uncle, fervent, passionate\nfaith. [SONIA kneels down before her uncle and lays her head on his\nhands. She speaks in a weary voice] We shall rest. [TELEGIN plays softly\non the guitar] We shall rest. We shall hear the angels. We shall see\nheaven shining like a jewel. We shall see all evil and all our pain sink\naway in the great compassion that shall enfold the world. Our life will\nbe as peaceful and tender and sweet as a caress. I have faith; I have\nfaith. [She wipes away her tears] My poor, poor Uncle Vanya, you are\ncrying! [Weeping] You have never known what happiness was, but wait,\nUncle Vanya, wait! We shall rest. [She embraces him] We shall rest. [The\nWATCHMAN'S rattle is heard in the garden; TELEGIN plays softly; MME.\nVOITSKAYA writes something on the margin of her pamphlet; MARINA knits\nher stocking] We shall rest.\n\nThe curtain slowly falls.\n\n","chapter_length":2974.0,"summary_name":"Act IV","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180409044821\/http:\/\/www.gradesaver.com\/uncle-vanya\/study-guide\/summary-act-iv","summary_text":"It is evening. The scene is Vanya's room, which is also the estate office. There is a map of Africa, a small table for Astrov, and a cage with a starling. Telegin and Marina are sitting in the office, discussing how Serebryakov and Helen are going to live in Kharkov. They both think this is a good thing, especially after Vanya's disgraceful behavior. Marina is looking forward to things going back to normal. Telegin sighs that he is looking forward to this. Marina smiles at Telegin when the old man confesses he hid the pistol in the cellar. Vanya and Astrov enter. Vanya is irritable, and orders Marina and Telegin out. They comply. Vanya tells Astrov to leave; Astrov says that he will, and with pleasure, but only when Vanya gives him back what is his. Vanya is confused, but Astrov stubbornly stands his ground. Vanya rues the fact that he missed the professor twice, and Astrov asks why he didn't just shoot himself if he had to shoot someone. Vanya shrugs. He wonders if they think he is mad, for he just tried to kill someone and he isn't arrested or in jail. He sneers that people can dress themselves up as professors or marry old men, yet no one thinks they are mad. He looks at Astrov and tells him that he saw him kiss Helen. Astrov admits this and thumbs his nose at Vanya. He calls Vanya an old clown and says he simply has no sense. Vanya hangs his head and says that the feeling of shame he has is worse than pain. He wonders what he is to do. Astrov replies that he can do nothing. Vanya laments his age and how he is to live the rest of the years of his life. He wishes that he could wake up one day with a fresh start. Astrov is annoyed with him and states that both of their lives are hopeless. Vanya points to his own chest and asks for something. Astrov shouts at him to shut up, but then more gently says that their only hope is to have pleasant visions once they're in their graves. He and Vanya are the only civilized people in their district, but the parochial existence ruined them and \"poisoned our blood and we've become as second-rate as the rest of them\" . After a moment, Astrov repeats his claim that Vanya took something from him: a bottle of morphia out of his medical case. If Vanya wants to do himself in, he might as well go into the woods and shoot himself, but Astrov can't have people thinking he gave Vanya the bottle. Sonya enters, and Astrov tells her she needs to tell her uncle to give him back the morphia. She looks at Vanya and asks if he took it, then moves toward him and tells him affectionately that he has to give it back. He cannot give into despair; he should be patient. She weeps and holds his hands; Vanya gives in and returns the bottle, saying he must get back to work. Helen enters and tells Vanya that Serebryakov wants a word with him. Vanya and Sonya depart. Helen gives Astrov her hand and says goodbye. Astrov asks her once more about the forest reservation tomorrow; she tells him flatly that it is ended and they are leaving. Astrov makes an impatient gesture and says she has nothing else to do, no object in life, and no occupations; thus, she ought to stay in this rather romantic place. Helen replies that he is absurd, but that she will remember him fondly because he is interesting and different from the others. They shake hands and Astrov says that, yes, she had better leave. She and her husband riled up the place and infected them all with their idleness. Astrov jokes that they bring havoc wherever they go. Helen picks up a pencil and says she will take it to remember him by. He is amused that they will never see each other again. Helen kisses him on the cheek, then impulsively kisses him on the lips and wishes him happiness. Everyone else enters. Serebryakov wishes Vanya the best, and they formally kiss three times in parting. Everyone in the group exchanges farewells, and Serebryakov urges them to get down to work. Helen kisses Vanya on the head and leaves. Serebryakov follows, asking Telegin to get their carriage. Vanya starts rifling through his papers, commenting that he is depressed and must get to work immediately. Outside bells sound, and Astrov comments that they are gone. Marina enters and sits down to knit a sock. Sonya enters and tells her uncle they should get to work. She lights the lamp and sighs that she is sad that they've gone. She and Vanya start to work. Astrov comments that it is quiet and peaceful here, and Marina suggests that he should stay. He says he cannot, and at that moment a laborer comes in and says his carriage is ready. Sonya stands to say goodbye and asks when he will return. He replies that he won't return any earlier than next summer. Marina offers him some vodka; he takes it and then leaves. Outside, harness bells are heard and Marina comments that Astrov is gone. Telegin strums quietly on his guitar while Sonya and Vanya write. Vanya tells his niece that he is so depressed. She looks at him with compassion and says that life will go on. It will be long, tiring, and they will never have peace; beyond the grave, though, they will know that although they wept, suffered, and their lot was bitter, God will pity them and they will have another life of beauty, light, and joy. Sonya kneels before her uncle and tells him softly multiple times that they will have peace, they will see the angels, they will experience a flood of mercy, and they will have a calm, gentle, and sweet life. Vanya hasn't had any happiness yet, but he will in the future. Sonya reaches up to wipe his tears away and tells him again that they will find peace.","summary_analysis":"The fourth and final act of Uncle Vanya is, to say the least, anticlimactic ). Helen stays faithful to Serebryakov, and both of them depart the estate. Serebryakov is just as shortsighted, pompous, and self-absorbed as he was prior to his departure, and Helen is just as bored and unhappy. Helen and Astrov kiss, but it is perfunctory and passionless. The unmarried Sonya returns to work, as do Marina and Telegin. Astrov leaves for the season, just as simultaneously hopeful and cynical as he was earlier. As for Vanya, he has further revealed himself to be ridiculous. His complaints, his demonization of Serebryakov, his lack of personal insight, his attempt to seduce Helen, and the attempted murder \"make him comically pathetic rather than tragically heroic,\" as critic Geoffrey Borny writes. His exclamation that he could have been the inimitable Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky ultimately comes across as petulant and inane rather than as a legitimate woe. Overall, no one seems to have learned any lessons or decided to alter their current state of existence. Critic Jane Anderson writes, \" must live without the illusions of their hopes. Each must once again take up the stifling trifles of daily life to distract themselves from their lives of quiet desperation.\" Chekhov himself once wrote, \"In spite of all my attempts at being serious, the result is noting; with me the serious always alternates with the trivial.\" Critic John Weston lauds the confluence of serious and trivial, and he doesn't lay the blame entirely at the characters' feet. He writes, \"it is not so much the personal defects of character that cause unhappiness as it is the pressures and tensions of everyday country life created by economic and social conditions of the time. It is the boring, stupefying, and vulgar life in the country which drags down intelligent people like Astrov and Uncle Vanya and Sonya and Serebryakov to the level of pettiness and selfishness.\" Finally, Sonya's speech to Vanya merits analysis. She imitates the sentiments Marina conveyed to Astrov at the beginning of the play--that God will remember them. For Sonya, life is indeed hard work with little recognition, but it is the hope of an afterlife that sustains her. She tells her uncle, \"In the world beyond the grave we shall say we have wept and suffered, that our lot was harsh and bitter, and God will have pity on us. And you and I, Uncle, shall behold a life which is bright and beautiful and splendid\" . Sonya's religious faith allows her to genuinely comfort her uncle, as well as to prop herself up after learning that Astrov does not love her. Sadly, though, there is no evidence that Vanya shares his niece's faith. He merely sobs while she tries to comfort him. Borny notes, \"Sonya's long speech of faith at the end of the play is undercut by the fact that she is preaching to the unconverted. Vanya appears to have little faith in the existence of Sonya's God, and even though he has now resumed working, he no longer has faith in the value of work.\" Vanya will most likely get back to a place where he finds value in work, but it may take a long time and will be liable to disruption again.","summary_length":1029.0,"analysis_length":546.0,"chap_int":4,"previous summary id":["act iii","act 3","act iii"],"previous chapter":["In the drawing room, Vanya and Sonya sit; Helen, deep in thought, walks up to them. Vanya complains to the ladies that Serebryakov wants to speak to them, no doubt about something pointless. He mocks Helen for her charming laziness, and Helen furrows her brow. She tells him to stop and says that she is excessively bored. Sonya suggests that there are plenty of things for her to do, such as working on the farm, or teaching, or nursing. Helen simply replies that she cannot to do that sort of thing. Sonya tells her that her boredom is infectious, and that she could certainly teach. Vanya sneers that Helen has mermaid's blood and ought to just fall into the river with a river-god. Helen is angry, even when Vanya apologizes and kisses her hand. She wonders how they will ever get through the winter. After Vanya leaves, Sonya confides in Helen that she is sad that she is not beautiful. Helen compliments her hair, but this does not comfort Sonya. She loves Astrov's voice, his hand, and the sound of him arriving at the house, but he doesn't seem to even notice her. Helen thoughtfully says she will talk to him on her behalf; Sonya is pleased but a bit agitated, and makes Helen promise to tell her exactly what he says. Helen does; the plan is for Sonya to tell Astrov that Helen wants to see his maps. After Sonya departs, Helen muses aloud that Astrov certainly does not love Sonya; however, even though she is not beautiful, she would make him a good wife because she is clever and unspoiled. Helen feels like she understands Sonya, and she certainly understands ghastly boredom and how Astrov's occasional appearance enlivens that boredom. He is different from the others and is like a \"bright moon rising in the darkness\" . Helen sighs that she wishes she could fly away like a bird from all of this, but she is too much of a coward to leave. Astrov enters with his maps, happily asking if she wants to see them. Astrov spreads them out; as he does so, he asks where she is from and where she was educated. He wonders if she could actually be interested in this; Helen responds that she might not know much about country life, but she has read a lot. Astrov begins to speak about the maps, a pleasure he allows himself only once a month. The first map, he begins, is the district fifty years ago. Half the area was wooded. The land featured small isolated hamlets and a great deal of birds and cattle and horses. Twenty-five years ago, though, some of the animals were gone, and only a third of the area was wooded. Old hamlets and farmsteads vanished, and the \"general picture is one of a gradual and unmistakable decline\" . Things have certainly worsened over the last years. Astrov pauses and says that if people had built roads and railways instead of simply destroying the forests, or had erected factories and schools, then the peasants would be better off and happier. However, this did not happen: the district is still mosquito-laden, poor, and prone to fires and disease. People find the struggle for existence difficult, he says: they are backward, ignorant, and have no idea what they're doing. A man's only instinct is to be warm and fed, and he does not think about the future. Astrov looks at Helen and coldly comments that she is bored. She replies that she understands little, but he denies this: she is just not interested. Helen asks if she can change the subject, so they sit down and asks bluntly about Sonya--does she attract him as a woman? He answers no. Helen sighs and says that Sonya is so unhappy, and that he ought to stop coming here. Astrov, annoyed, stands up. Helen feels that this is a disagreeable conversation and is wearied by it. She tells them that they ought to pretend like nothing was said. Astrov stares at her and asks why she brought it up. He shrugs but then regards her more carefully and comments that she is a little box of tricks. Helen is confused, and he laughs that she has it all figured out. He presses on and says she knows perfectly well why he comes here, that she's a little vampire, and that he is not new to this. Helen is still confused, and Astrov smiles that she is a beautiful little weasel. He bows his head and mockingly says that he surrenders. Helen is surprised, calls him crazy, and moves to leave, but he bars her way and takes her hand. He moves closer and passionately begs her to let him kiss her. He kisses her hand as she tries to pull away. He leans in, imploring her to tell him when they can meet, and he kisses her as Vanya walks in. Helen does not see Vanya, but she tells Astrov to leave her alone. He insists that she meet him at the forest reservation, but she still tries to extricate herself, especially once she notices Vanya. Vanya is carrying roses and puts them down. Astrov bitterly talks about the weather as he rolls up the maps. Helen runs up to Vanya and says he must do all he can to get her husband and her away from this house. Vanya is distracted but says \"of course.\" Serebryakov, Sonya, Telegin, and Marina enter. Serebryakov complains about the house. As her father prepares to speak, Sonya goes up to Helen and asks what Astrov said. Helen only says she will tell her later, and Sonya trembles and asks if he said he wasn't going to come anymore. Helen nods. Serebryakov tells everyone to sit down and Vanya asks in an annoyed, agitated tone if he is needed. Serebryakov tells him that he obviously is, and he wonders why he is acting like this. He begins his speech a moment later, explaining that he needs everyone's advice. He is old now and has to think about putting his affairs in order. It is impossible for him to live in the country, and the estate's income will not support them in the city. It is his proposal that they sell the estate, which would allow for a smaller cottage near St. Petersburg. Vanya is stunned and asks what Serebryakov thinks he, Mrs. Voynitksy, and Sonya will do. Serebryakov replies that they will figure that out in time. Vanya shakes his head, saying that he thought all this time that this was Sonya's estate. Serebryakov replies that it is, and that he would do this in her best interest. This does not comfort Vanya, even though Mrs. Voynitsky suggests listening to the professor. Serebryakov doesn't understand why people are upset, and Vanya interrupts clueless Telegin's comments to explain angrily how he gave up part of his inheritance so that his sister could buy this land. Furthermore, it is free from debt because he, Vanya, has worked so hard on it for twenty-five years. All this time, Serebryakov has neither thanked him nor given him an extra ruble. Telegin and Mrs. Voynitsky try to calm Vanya down but he continues, saying how he used to revere the professor's writing and books but how he now despises them. He says they used to think of the professor as superior, but now he sees that he knows nothing of the art he writes about. Serebryakov is still confused and Helen tries to calm Vanya down. Serebryakov tells Vanya that, if he wants the estate, it is his. Telegin runs out in distress. Helen shouts that she can't stand this. Vanya moans that his life is ruined, and that he could have been a Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky but for Serebryakov; he feels like he is going mad. Sonya leans before Marina in anguish. Vanya calls out to his mother, then announces he knows what to do, and runs out. Serebryakov proclaims he does not know what is wrong with Vanya, and Helen insists they must leave today. Sonya turns to her father and begs him to understand that she and her uncle are so unhappy and worked so hard for him their whole lives. Helen tells her husband that she must sort this out. Grudgingly, Serebryakov leaves to talk to Vanya with Helen following. Marina comforts Sonya. Suddenly, a shot is heard; Helen's scream follows. Serebryakov staggers back in, shouting about Vanya's madness. Helen and Vanya struggle over a revolver. Vanya bests her and fires again at Serebryakov but misses. He tries again and misses. He curses and sinks into a chair. Helen leans against a wall, her chest heaving. She says she must leave. Vanya wonders desperately what he is doing, and Sonya cries for Nanny.","In the daytime, Vanya, Sonya, and Yelena are gathered in the drawing room, waiting for Serebryakov, who has an announcement for them. Yelena says she's bored, and Sonya insists that she just needs something to keep herself busy because she's infecting everyone with her laziness. Vanya leaves and Sonya tells Yelena that she's dying of love for Astrov. Yelena promises to talk to him and find out if he feels the same way. Yelena says that it will be better to be certain, though Sonya isn't sure. She thinks that with uncertainty she at least still has hope. When Yelena approaches Astrov about Sonya, however, he just starts talking about the decay of society and civilization. Yelena finally gets her chance to ask Astrov about Sonya, and when he confirms that he doesn't love her, Yelena asks him to stop coming around so that he won't torture the poor girl anymore. Astrov misunderstands Yelena's intentions and thinks that she is the one who has a crush on him. He tries to kiss her, and just then Vanya walks in with a bouquet of flowers and sees Yelena struggling. The plot thickens. Yelena asks Vanya to help her get out of the country house. She wants to leave that very day. Finally, Serebryakov shows up to make his announcement. As his speech begins, Sonya can tell by Yelena's actions that Astrov doesn't love her. Serebryakov reveals that he's in financial doo doo. He doesn't have enough money to live in the city, but he hates living in the country. So he's going to sell the estate and move to Finland. Vanya is pretty ticked off at this proposal since he, his mother, and his niece, Sonya, won't have anywhere to go. He explains that the estate had belonged to his sister, and that he gave up his own inheritance to buy it for her. Now that he's worked for years keeping it running, his former brother-in-law wants to sell it out from under him. The family meeting turns into a shouting match, with Vanya and Yelena as the main maniacs. Sonya begs her father to have mercy on Vanya, reminding him that she, her uncle, and her grandmother worked their whole lives for him without asking for anything in return. Serebryakov goes offstage and a shot is fired. He comes back in, and Vanya shoots at him one more time. He misses both times, and gives up on his mission.","Set in the daytime, Act III opens in the drawing room with Voynitsky and Sonya seated as Yelena paces in thought. The professor has called a meeting at one o'clock. After grumbling about Serebryakov, Voynitsky attacks Yelena, describing her as ready to \"drop from sheer laziness\". Yelena replies that she is dying of boredom and is without an idea of what to do. Sonya produces a number of possibilities: help with the estate, teaching, nursing, and so on. Yelena cannot imagine being interested; only people in ideological novels undertake such work. For Sonya, Yelena's idleness is \"infectious\"--her effect on Vanya, herself, and the doctor, all of whom having deserted their work to follow her, make this clear. Yelena is certainly a witch. Voynitsky adds that she must have the blood of a mermaid and should flee the estate by diving into a whirlpool with some water sprite. Yelena is enraged: Voynitsky offers to pick her a bouquet of roses in apology and exits. Sadly Sonya then puts her head on Yelena's breast and once again begins pining for the doctor. Having loved him for six years, she has lost all pride and confessed her love to everyone except Astrov. Remarking that he is a strange person, Yelena resolves to find out what he thinks of Sonya, using his cartograms as a pretext. Sonya pauses for a moment, wondering if uncertainty is better and exits to fetch him. Yelena then delivers a soliloquy, ruminating on how Sonya cannot help falling for such a \"fascinating\" man amidst such boredom and admits her own fascination for the doctor. Recalling Vanya's quip about the mermaid, she wonders if she should flee with him--her conscience, however, prevents it. Indeed, she already feels guilty, ready to prostrate herself before Sonya and weep. Astrov then enters with a cartogram and proceeds to explain the progressive degeneration of the region. Forests, settlements, and wildlife have disappeared in the \"downhill struggle for existence\"; instead of progress, the same swamps, diseases, and disasters remain. It is clear to Astrov that Yelena is uninterested. He breaks off, and she cross-examines him with regards to Sonya. Astrov does not love her. He is, however, convinced that the subtext of Yelena's cross-examination is her own desire and that she is finally responding to his longtime advances. Much to Yelena's dismay, he embraces her passionately and insists upon arranging a rendezvous. Yelena resists, and suddenly Voynitsky enters unseen. For a moment, Yelena will then relent, laying her head on Astrov's chest. Just as the doctor proposes a rendezvous, however, she sees Voynitsky and disengages herself from his arms. Astrov chats about the weather, noting that the days are getting shorter, and he exits. Nervously, Yelena insists that Voynitsky prevail upon her husband for an immediate departure from the estate; a shaken Voynitsky replies that he has seen everything."],"next summary id":"act iv","next chapter":"It is evening. The scene is Vanya's room, which is also the estate office. There is a map of Africa, a small table for Astrov, and a cage with a starling. Telegin and Marina are sitting in the office, discussing how Serebryakov and Helen are going to live in Kharkov. They both think this is a good thing, especially after Vanya's disgraceful behavior. Marina is looking forward to things going back to normal. Telegin sighs that he is looking forward to this. Marina smiles at Telegin when the old man confesses he hid the pistol in the cellar. Vanya and Astrov enter. Vanya is irritable, and orders Marina and Telegin out. They comply. Vanya tells Astrov to leave; Astrov says that he will, and with pleasure, but only when Vanya gives him back what is his. Vanya is confused, but Astrov stubbornly stands his ground. Vanya rues the fact that he missed the professor twice, and Astrov asks why he didn't just shoot himself if he had to shoot someone. Vanya shrugs. He wonders if they think he is mad, for he just tried to kill someone and he isn't arrested or in jail. He sneers that people can dress themselves up as professors or marry old men, yet no one thinks they are mad. He looks at Astrov and tells him that he saw him kiss Helen. Astrov admits this and thumbs his nose at Vanya. He calls Vanya an old clown and says he simply has no sense. Vanya hangs his head and says that the feeling of shame he has is worse than pain. He wonders what he is to do. Astrov replies that he can do nothing. Vanya laments his age and how he is to live the rest of the years of his life. He wishes that he could wake up one day with a fresh start. Astrov is annoyed with him and states that both of their lives are hopeless. Vanya points to his own chest and asks for something. Astrov shouts at him to shut up, but then more gently says that their only hope is to have pleasant visions once they're in their graves. He and Vanya are the only civilized people in their district, but the parochial existence ruined them and \"poisoned our blood and we've become as second-rate as the rest of them\" . After a moment, Astrov repeats his claim that Vanya took something from him: a bottle of morphia out of his medical case. If Vanya wants to do himself in, he might as well go into the woods and shoot himself, but Astrov can't have people thinking he gave Vanya the bottle. Sonya enters, and Astrov tells her she needs to tell her uncle to give him back the morphia. She looks at Vanya and asks if he took it, then moves toward him and tells him affectionately that he has to give it back. He cannot give into despair; he should be patient. She weeps and holds his hands; Vanya gives in and returns the bottle, saying he must get back to work. Helen enters and tells Vanya that Serebryakov wants a word with him. Vanya and Sonya depart. Helen gives Astrov her hand and says goodbye. Astrov asks her once more about the forest reservation tomorrow; she tells him flatly that it is ended and they are leaving. Astrov makes an impatient gesture and says she has nothing else to do, no object in life, and no occupations; thus, she ought to stay in this rather romantic place. Helen replies that he is absurd, but that she will remember him fondly because he is interesting and different from the others. They shake hands and Astrov says that, yes, she had better leave. She and her husband riled up the place and infected them all with their idleness. Astrov jokes that they bring havoc wherever they go. Helen picks up a pencil and says she will take it to remember him by. He is amused that they will never see each other again. Helen kisses him on the cheek, then impulsively kisses him on the lips and wishes him happiness. Everyone else enters. Serebryakov wishes Vanya the best, and they formally kiss three times in parting. Everyone in the group exchanges farewells, and Serebryakov urges them to get down to work. Helen kisses Vanya on the head and leaves. Serebryakov follows, asking Telegin to get their carriage. Vanya starts rifling through his papers, commenting that he is depressed and must get to work immediately. Outside bells sound, and Astrov comments that they are gone. Marina enters and sits down to knit a sock. Sonya enters and tells her uncle they should get to work. She lights the lamp and sighs that she is sad that they've gone. She and Vanya start to work. Astrov comments that it is quiet and peaceful here, and Marina suggests that he should stay. He says he cannot, and at that moment a laborer comes in and says his carriage is ready. Sonya stands to say goodbye and asks when he will return. He replies that he won't return any earlier than next summer. Marina offers him some vodka; he takes it and then leaves. Outside, harness bells are heard and Marina comments that Astrov is gone. Telegin strums quietly on his guitar while Sonya and Vanya write. Vanya tells his niece that he is so depressed. She looks at him with compassion and says that life will go on. It will be long, tiring, and they will never have peace; beyond the grave, though, they will know that although they wept, suffered, and their lot was bitter, God will pity them and they will have another life of beauty, light, and joy. Sonya kneels before her uncle and tells him softly multiple times that they will have peace, they will see the angels, they will experience a flood of mercy, and they will have a calm, gentle, and sweet life. Vanya hasn't had any happiness yet, but he will in the future. Sonya reaches up to wipe his tears away and tells him again that they will find peace."}

Astrov claims that Vanya has stolen some morphine from him and can't leave until he gets it back. Sonya enters, and Astrov tattles to her about the morphine. She begs her uncle to give it back, and he finally does. Sonya takes her uncle away to make up with her dad, and Yelena shows up to say goodbye to Astrov.

Near by stands a smaller table belonging to ASTROFF, with\nhis paints and drawing materials. On the wall hangs a cage containing a\nstarling. There is also a map of Africa on the wall, obviously of no use\nto anybody. There is a large sofa covered with buckram. A door to the\nleft leads into an inner room; one to the right leads into the front\nhall, and before this door lies a mat for the peasants with their muddy\nboots to stand on. It is an autumn evening. The silence is profound.\nTELEGIN and MARINA are sitting facing one another, winding wool.\n\nTELEGIN. Be quick, Marina, or we shall be called away to say good-bye\nbefore you have finished. The carriage has already been ordered.\n\nMARINA. [Trying to wind more quickly] I am a little tired.\n\nTELEGIN. They are going to Kharkoff to live.\n\nMARINA. They do well to go.\n\nTELEGIN. They have been frightened. The professor's wife won't stay here\nan hour longer. \"If we are going at all, let's be off,\" says she, \"we\nshall go to Kharkoff and look about us, and then we can send for our\nthings.\" They are travelling light. It seems, Marina, that fate has\ndecreed for them not to live here.\n\nMARINA. And quite rightly. What a storm they have just raised! It was\nshameful!\n\nTELEGIN. It was indeed. The scene was worthy of the brush of Aibazofski.\n\nMARINA. I wish I'd never laid eyes on them. [A pause] Now we shall have\nthings as they were again: tea at eight, dinner at one, and supper in\nthe evening; everything in order as decent folks, as Christians like to\nhave it. [Sighs] It is a long time since I have eaten noodles.\n\nTELEGIN. Yes, we haven't had noodles for ages. [A pause] Not for ages.\nAs I was going through the village this morning, Marina, one of the\nshop-keepers called after me, \"Hi! you hanger-on!\" I felt it bitterly.\n\nMARINA. Don't pay the least attention to them, master; we are all\ndependents on God. You and Sonia and all of us. Every one must work, no\none can sit idle. Where is Sonia?\n\nTELEGIN. In the garden with the doctor, looking for Ivan. They fear he\nmay lay violent hands on himself.\n\nMARINA. Where is his pistol?\n\nTELEGIN. [Whispers] I hid it in the cellar.\n\nVOITSKI and ASTROFF come in.\n\nVOITSKI. Leave me alone! [To MARINA and TELEGIN] Go away! Go away and\nleave me to myself, if but for an hour. I won't have you watching me\nlike this!\n\nTELEGIN. Yes, yes, Vanya. [He goes out on tiptoe.]\n\nMARINA. The gander cackles; ho! ho! ho!\n\n[She gathers up her wool and goes out.]\n\nVOITSKI. Leave me by myself!\n\nASTROFF. I would, with the greatest pleasure. I ought to have gone long\nago, but I shan't leave you until you have returned what you took from\nme.\n\nVOITSKI. I took nothing from you.\n\nASTROFF. I am not jesting, don't detain me, I really must go.\n\nVOITSKI. I took nothing of yours.\n\nASTROFF. You didn't? Very well, I shall have to wait a little longer,\nand then you will have to forgive me if I resort to force. We shall have\nto bind you and search you. I mean what I say.\n\nVOITSKI. Do as you please. [A pause] Oh, to make such a fool of myself!\nTo shoot twice and miss him both times! I shall never forgive myself.\n\nASTROFF. When the impulse came to shoot, it would have been as well had\nyou put a bullet through your own head.\n\nVOITSKI. [Shrugging his shoulders] Strange! I attempted murder, and am\nnot going to be arrested or brought to trial. That means they think\nme mad. [With a bitter laugh] Me! I am mad, and those who hide their\nworthlessness, their dullness, their crying heartlessness behind a\nprofessor's mask, are sane! Those who marry old men and then deceive\nthem under the noses of all, are sane! I saw you kiss her; I saw you in\neach other's arms!\n\nASTROFF. Yes, sir, I did kiss her; so there. [He puts his thumb to his\nnose.]\n\nVOITSKI. [His eyes on the door] No, it is the earth that is mad, because\nshe still bears us on her breast.\n\nASTROFF. That is nonsense.\n\nVOITSKI. Well? Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible? Haven't I\nthe right to talk nonsense?\n\nASTROFF. This is a farce! You are not mad; you are simply a ridiculous\nfool. I used to think every fool was out of his senses, but now I\nsee that lack of sense is a man's normal state, and you are perfectly\nnormal.\n\nVOITSKI. [Covers his face with his hands] Oh! If you knew how ashamed\nI am! These piercing pangs of shame are like nothing on earth. [In an\nagonised voice] I can't endure them! [He leans against the table] What\ncan I do? What can I do?\n\nASTROFF. Nothing.\n\nVOITSKI. You must tell me something! Oh, my God! I am forty-seven years\nold. I may live to sixty; I still have thirteen years before me; an\neternity! How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?\nWhat shall I do? How can I fill them? Oh, don't you see? [He presses\nASTROFF'S hand convulsively] Don't you see, if only I could live the\nrest of my life in some new way! If I could only wake some still, bright\nmorning and feel that life had begun again; that the past was forgotten\nand had vanished like smoke. [He weeps] Oh, to begin life anew! Tell me,\ntell me how to begin.\n\nASTROFF. [Crossly] What nonsense! What sort of a new life can you and I\nlook forward to? We can have no hope.\n\nVOITSKI. None?\n\nASTROFF. None. Of that I am convinced.\n\nVOITSKI. Tell me what to do. [He puts his hand to his heart] I feel such\na burning pain here.\n\nASTROFF. [Shouts angrily] Stop! [Then, more gently] It may be that\nposterity, which will despise us for our blind and stupid lives, will\nfind some road to happiness; but we--you and I--have but one hope, the\nhope that we may be visited by visions, perhaps by pleasant ones, as we\nlie resting in our graves. [Sighing] Yes, brother, there were only two\nrespectable, intelligent men in this county, you and I. Ten years or so\nof this life of ours, this miserable life, have sucked us under, and we\nhave become as contemptible and petty as the rest. But don't try to talk\nme out of my purpose! Give me what you took from me, will you?\n\nVOITSKI. I took nothing from you.\n\nASTROFF. You took a little bottle of morphine out of my medicine-case.\n[A pause] Listen! If you are positively determined to make an end\nto yourself, go into the woods and shoot yourself there. Give up the\nmorphine, or there will be a lot of talk and guesswork; people will\nthink I gave it to you. I don't fancy having to perform a post-mortem on\nyou. Do you think I should find it interesting?\n\nSONIA comes in.\n\nVOITSKI. Leave me alone.\n\nASTROFF. [To SONIA] Sonia, your uncle has stolen a bottle of morphine\nout of my medicine-case and won't give it up. Tell him that his\nbehaviour is--well, unwise. I haven't time, I must be going.\n\nSONIA. Uncle Vanya, did you take the morphine?\n\nASTROFF. Yes, he took it. [A pause] I am absolutely sure.\n\nSONIA. Give it up! Why do you want to frighten us? [Tenderly] Give it\nup, Uncle Vanya! My misfortune is perhaps even greater than yours, but I\nam not plunged in despair. I endure my sorrow, and shall endure it until\nmy life comes to a natural end. You must endure yours, too. [A pause]\nGive it up! Dear, darling Uncle Vanya. Give it up! [She weeps] You are\nso good, I am sure you will have pity on us and give it up. You must\nendure your sorrow, Uncle Vanya; you must endure it.\n\nVOITSKI takes a bottle from the drawer of the table and hands it to\nASTROFF.\n\nVOITSKI. There it is! [To SONIA] And now, we must get to work at once;\nwe must do something, or else I shall not be able to endure it.\n\nSONIA. Yes, yes, to work! As soon as we have seen them off we shall\ngo to work. [She nervously straightens out the papers on the table]\nEverything is in a muddle!\n\nASTROFF. [Putting the bottle in his case, which he straps together] Now\nI can be off.\n\nHELENA comes in.\n\nHELENA. Are you here, Ivan? We are starting in a moment. Go to\nAlexander, he wants to speak to you.\n\nSONIA. Go, Uncle Vanya. [She takes VOITSKI 'S arm] Come, you and papa\nmust make peace; that is absolutely necessary.\n\nSONIA and VOITSKI go out.\n\nHELENA. I am going away. [She gives ASTROFF her hand] Good-bye.\n\nASTROFF. So soon?\n\nHELENA. The carriage is waiting.\n\nASTROFF. Good-bye.\n\nHELENA. You promised me you would go away yourself to-day.\n\nASTROFF. I have not forgotten. I am going at once. [A pause] Were you\nfrightened? Was it so terrible?\n\nHELENA. Yes.\n\nASTROFF. Couldn't you stay? Couldn't you? To-morrow--in the forest--\n\nHELENA. No. It is all settled, and that is why I can look you so bravely\nin the face. Our departure is fixed. One thing I must ask of you: don't\nthink too badly of me; I should like you to respect me.\n\nASTROFF. Ah! [With an impatient gesture] Stay, I implore you! Confess\nthat there is nothing for you to do in this world. You have no object\nin life; there is nothing to occupy your attention, and sooner or later\nyour feelings must master you. It is inevitable. It would be better if\nit happened not in Kharkoff or in Kursk, but here, in nature's lap.\nIt would then at least be poetical, even beautiful. Here you have the\nforests, the houses half in ruins that Turgenieff writes of.\n\nHELENA. How comical you are! I am angry with you and yet I shall always\nremember you with pleasure. You are interesting and original. You and\nI will never meet again, and so I shall tell you--why should I conceal\nit?--that I am just a little in love with you. Come, one more last\npressure of our hands, and then let us part good friends. Let us not\nbear each other any ill will.\n\nASTROFF. [Pressing her hand] Yes, go. [Thoughtfully] You seem to be\nsincere and good, and yet there is something strangely disquieting about\nall your personality. No sooner did you arrive here with your husband\nthan every one whom you found busy and actively creating something was\nforced to drop his work and give himself up for the whole summer to\nyour husband's gout and yourself. You and he have infected us with your\nidleness. I have been swept off my feet; I have not put my hand to\na thing for weeks, during which sickness has been running its course\nunchecked among the people, and the peasants have been pasturing their\ncattle in my woods and young plantations. Go where you will, you and\nyour husband will always carry destruction in your train. I am joking of\ncourse, and yet I am strangely sure that had you stayed here we should\nhave been overtaken by the most immense desolation. I would have gone\nto my ruin, and you--you would not have prospered. So go! E finita la\ncomedia!\n\nHELENA. [Snatching a pencil off ASTROFF'S table, and hiding it with a\nquick movement] I shall take this pencil for memory!\n\nASTROFF. How strange it is. We meet, and then suddenly it seems that\nwe must part forever. That is the way in this world. As long as we are\nalone, before Uncle Vanya comes in with a bouquet--allow me--to kiss you\ngood-bye--may I? [He kisses her on the cheek] So! Splendid!\n\nHELENA. I wish you every happiness. [She glances about her] For once\nin my life, I shall! and scorn the consequences! [She kisses him\nimpetuously, and they quickly part] I must go.\n\nASTROFF. Yes, go. If the carriage is there, then start at once. [They\nstand listening.]\n\nASTROFF. E finita!\n\nVOITSKI, SEREBRAKOFF, MME. VOITSKAYA with her book, TELEGIN, and SONIA\ncome in.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [To VOITSKI] Shame on him who bears malice for the past. I\nhave gone through so much in the last few hours that I feel capable of\nwriting a whole treatise on the conduct of life for the instruction\nof posterity. I gladly accept your apology, and myself ask your\nforgiveness. [He kisses VOITSKI three times.]\n\nHELENA embraces SONIA.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [Kissing MME. VOITSKAYA'S hand] Mother!\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA. [Kissing him] Have your picture taken, Alexander, and\nsend me one. You know how dear you are to me.\n\nTELEGIN. Good-bye, your Excellency. Don't forget us.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [Kissing his daughter] Good-bye, good-bye all. [Shaking\nhands with ASTROFF] Many thanks for your pleasant company. I have a deep\nregard for your opinions and your enthusiasm, but let me, as an old man,\ngive one word of advice at parting: do something, my friend! Work! Do\nsomething! [They all bow] Good luck to you all. [He goes out followed by\nMME. VOITSKAYA and SONIA.]\n\nVOITSKI [Kissing HELENA'S hand fervently] Good-bye--forgive me. I shall\nnever see you again!\n\nHELENA. [Touched] Good-bye, dear boy.\n\nShe lightly kisses his head as he bends over her hand, and goes out.\n\nASTROFF. Tell them to bring my carriage around too, Waffles.\n\nTELEGIN. All right, old man.\n\nASTROFF and VOITSKI are left behind alone. ASTROFF collects his paints\nand drawing materials on the table and packs them away in a box.\n\nASTROFF. Why don't you go to see them off?\n\nVOITSKI. Let them go! I--I can't go out there. I feel too sad. I must go\nto work on something at once. To work! To work!\n\nHe rummages through his papers on the table. A pause. The tinkling of\nbells is heard as the horses trot away.\n\nASTROFF. They have gone! The professor, I suppose, is glad to go. He\ncouldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.\n\nMARINA comes in.\n\nMARINA. They have gone. [She sits down in an arm-chair and knits her\nstocking.]\n\nSONIA comes in wiping her eyes.\n\nSONIA. They have gone. God be with them. [To her uncle] And now, Uncle\nVanya, let us do something!\n\nVOITSKI. To work! To work!\n\nSONIA. It is long, long, since you and I have sat together at this\ntable. [She lights a lamp on the table] No ink! [She takes the inkstand\nto the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle] How sad it is to see\nthem go!\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA comes slowly in.\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA. They have gone.\n\nShe sits down and at once becomes absorbed in her book. SONIA sits down\nat the table and looks through an account book.\n\nSONIA. First, Uncle Vanya, let us write up the accounts. They are in a\ndreadful state. Come, begin. You take one and I will take the other.\n\nVOITSKI. In account with [They sit silently writing.]\n\nMARINA. [Yawning] The sand-man has come.\n\nASTROFF. How still it is. Their pens scratch, the cricket sings; it is\nso warm and comfortable. I hate to go. [The tinkling of bells is heard.]\n\nASTROFF. My carriage has come. There now remains but to say good-bye to\nyou, my friends, and to my table here, and then--away! [He puts the map\ninto the portfolio.]\n\nMARINA. Don't hurry away; sit a little longer with us.\n\nASTROFF. Impossible.\n\nVOITSKI. [Writing] And carry forward from the old debt two\nseventy-five--\n\nWORKMAN comes in.\n\nWORKMAN. Your carriage is waiting, sir.\n\nASTROFF. All right. [He hands the WORKMAN his medicine-case, portfolio,\nand box] Look out, don't crush the portfolio!\n\nWORKMAN. Very well, sir.\n\nSONIA. When shall we see you again?\n\nASTROFF. Hardly before next summer. Probably not this winter, though, of\ncourse, if anything should happen you will let me know. [He shakes\nhands with them] Thank you for your kindness, for your hospitality, for\neverything! [He goes up to MARINA and kisses her head] Good-bye, old\nnurse!\n\nMARINA. Are you going without your tea?\n\nASTROFF. I don't want any, nurse.\n\nMARINA. Won't you have a drop of vodka?\n\nASTROFF. [Hesitatingly] Yes, I might.\n\nMARINA goes out.\n\nASTROFF. [After a pause] My off-wheeler has gone lame for some reason. I\nnoticed it yesterday when Peter was taking him to water.\n\nVOITSKI. You should have him re-shod.\n\nASTROFF. I shall have to go around by the blacksmith's on my way home.\nIt can't be avoided. [He stands looking up at the map of Africa hanging\non the wall] I suppose it is roasting hot in Africa now.\n\nVOITSKI.

Vanya complains to the ladies that Serebryakov wants to speak to them, no doubt about something pointless. He mocks Helen for her charming laziness, and Helen furrows her brow. She tells him to stop and says that she is excessively bored. Sonya suggests that there are plenty of things for her to do, such as working on the farm, or teaching, or nursing. Helen simply replies that she cannot to do that sort of thing. Sonya tells her that her boredom is infectious, and that she could certainly teach. Vanya sneers that Helen has mermaid's blood and ought to just fall into the river with a river-god. Helen is angry, even when Vanya apologizes and kisses her hand. She wonders how they will ever get through the winter. After Vanya leaves, Sonya confides in Helen that she is sad that she is not beautiful. Helen compliments her hair, but this does not comfort Sonya. She loves Astrov's voice, his hand, and the sound of him arriving at the house, but he doesn't seem to even notice her. Helen thoughtfully says she will talk to him on her behalf; Sonya is pleased but a bit agitated, and makes Helen promise to tell her exactly what he says. Helen does; the plan is for Sonya to tell Astrov that Helen wants to see his maps. After Sonya departs, Helen muses aloud that Astrov certainly does not love Sonya; however, even though she is not beautiful, she would make him a good wife because she is clever and unspoiled. Helen feels like she understands Sonya, and she certainly understands ghastly boredom and how Astrov's occasional appearance enlivens that boredom. He is different from the others and is like a \"bright moon rising in the darkness\" . Helen sighs that she wishes she could fly away like a bird from all of this, but she is too much of a coward to leave. Astrov enters with his maps, happily asking if she wants to see them. Astrov spreads them out; as he does so, he asks where she is from and where she was educated. He wonders if she could actually be interested in this; Helen responds that she might not know much about country life, but she has read a lot. Astrov begins to speak about the maps, a pleasure he allows himself only once a month. The first map, he begins, is the district fifty years ago. Half the area was wooded. The land featured small isolated hamlets and a great deal of birds and cattle and horses. Twenty-five years ago, though, some of the animals were gone, and only a third of the area was wooded. Old hamlets and farmsteads vanished, and the \"general picture is one of a gradual and unmistakable decline\" . Things have certainly worsened over the last years. Astrov pauses and says that if people had built roads and railways instead of simply destroying the forests, or had erected factories and schools, then the peasants would be better off and happier. However, this did not happen: the district is still mosquito-laden, poor, and prone to fires and disease. People find the struggle for existence difficult, he says: they are backward, ignorant, and have no idea what they're doing. A man's only instinct is to be warm and fed, and he does not think about the future. Astrov looks at Helen and coldly comments that she is bored. She replies that she understands little, but he denies this: she is just not interested. Helen asks if she can change the subject, so they sit down and asks bluntly about Sonya--does she attract him as a woman? He answers no. Helen sighs and says that Sonya is so unhappy, and that he ought to stop coming here. Astrov, annoyed, stands up. Helen feels that this is a disagreeable conversation and is wearied by it. She tells them that they ought to pretend like nothing was said. Astrov stares at her and asks why she brought it up. He shrugs but then regards her more carefully and comments that she is a little box of tricks. Helen is confused, and he laughs that she has it all figured out. He presses on and says she knows perfectly well why he comes here, that she's a little vampire, and that he is not new to this. Helen is still confused, and Astrov smiles that she is a beautiful little weasel. He bows his head and mockingly says that he surrenders. Helen is surprised, calls him crazy, and moves to leave, but he bars her way and takes her hand. He moves closer and passionately begs her to let him kiss her. He kisses her hand as she tries to pull away. He leans in, imploring her to tell him when they can meet, and he kisses her as Vanya walks in. Helen does not see Vanya, but she tells Astrov to leave her alone. He insists that she meet him at the forest reservation, but she still tries to extricate herself, especially once she notices Vanya. Vanya is carrying roses and puts them down. Astrov bitterly talks about the weather as he rolls up the maps. Helen runs up to Vanya and says he must do all he can to get her husband and her away from this house. Vanya is distracted but says \"of course.\" Serebryakov, Sonya, Telegin, and Marina enter. Serebryakov complains about the house. As her father prepares to speak, Sonya goes up to Helen and asks what Astrov said. Helen only says she will tell her later, and Sonya trembles and asks if he said he wasn't going to come anymore. Helen nods. Serebryakov tells everyone to sit down and Vanya asks in an annoyed, agitated tone if he is needed. Serebryakov tells him that he obviously is, and he wonders why he is acting like this. He begins his speech a moment later, explaining that he needs everyone's advice. He is old now and has to think about putting his affairs in order. It is impossible for him to live in the country, and the estate's income will not support them in the city. It is his proposal that they sell the estate, which would allow for a smaller cottage near St. Petersburg. Vanya is stunned and asks what Serebryakov thinks he, Mrs. Voynitksy, and Sonya will do. Serebryakov replies that they will figure that out in time. Vanya shakes his head, saying that he thought all this time that this was Sonya's estate. Serebryakov replies that it is, and that he would do this in her best interest. This does not comfort Vanya, even though Mrs. Voynitsky suggests listening to the professor. Serebryakov doesn't understand why people are upset, and Vanya interrupts clueless Telegin's comments to explain angrily how he gave up part of his inheritance so that his sister could buy this land. Furthermore, it is free from debt because he, Vanya, has worked so hard on it for twenty-five years. All this time, Serebryakov has neither thanked him nor given him an extra ruble. Telegin and Mrs. Voynitsky try to calm Vanya down but he continues, saying how he used to revere the professor's writing and books but how he now despises them. He says they used to think of the professor as superior, but now he sees that he knows nothing of the art he writes about. Serebryakov is still confused and Helen tries to calm Vanya down. Serebryakov tells Vanya that, if he wants the estate, it is his. Telegin runs out in distress. Helen shouts that she can't stand this. Vanya moans that his life is ruined, and that he could have been a Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky but for Serebryakov; he feels like he is going mad. Sonya leans before Marina in anguish. Vanya calls out to his mother, then announces he knows what to do, and runs out. Serebryakov proclaims he does not know what is wrong with Vanya, and Helen insists they must leave today. Sonya turns to her father and begs him to understand that she and her uncle are so unhappy and worked so hard for him their whole lives. Helen tells her husband that she must sort this out. Grudgingly, Serebryakov leaves to talk to Vanya with Helen following. Marina comforts Sonya. Suddenly, a shot is heard; Helen's scream follows. Serebryakov staggers back in, shouting about Vanya's madness. Helen and Vanya struggle over a revolver. Vanya bests her and fires again at Serebryakov but misses. He tries again and misses. He curses and sinks into a chair. Helen leans against a wall, her chest heaving. She says she must leave. Vanya wonders desperately what he is doing, and Sonya cries for Nanny.","In the daytime, Vanya, Sonya, and Yelena are gathered in the drawing room, waiting for Serebryakov, who has an announcement for them. Yelena says she's bored, and Sonya insists that she just needs something to keep herself busy because she's infecting everyone with her laziness. Vanya leaves and Sonya tells Yelena that she's dying of love for Astrov. Yelena promises to talk to him and find out if he feels the same way. Yelena says that it will be better to be certain, though Sonya isn't sure. She thinks that with uncertainty she at least still has hope. When Yelena approaches Astrov about Sonya, however, he just starts talking about the decay of society and civilization. Yelena finally gets her chance to ask Astrov about Sonya, and when he confirms that he doesn't love her, Yelena asks him to stop coming around so that he won't torture the poor girl anymore. Astrov misunderstands Yelena's intentions and thinks that she is the one who has a crush on him. He tries to kiss her, and just then Vanya walks in with a bouquet of flowers and sees Yelena struggling. The plot thickens. Yelena asks Vanya to help her get out of the country house. She wants to leave that very day. Finally, Serebryakov shows up to make his announcement. As his speech begins, Sonya can tell by Yelena's actions that Astrov doesn't love her. Serebryakov reveals that he's in financial doo doo. He doesn't have enough money to live in the city, but he hates living in the country. So he's going to sell the estate and move to Finland. Vanya is pretty ticked off at this proposal since he, his mother, and his niece, Sonya, won't have anywhere to go. He explains that the estate had belonged to his sister, and that he gave up his own inheritance to buy it for her. Now that he's worked for years keeping it running, his former brother-in-law wants to sell it out from under him. The family meeting turns into a shouting match, with Vanya and Yelena as the main maniacs. Sonya begs her father to have mercy on Vanya, reminding him that she, her uncle, and her grandmother worked their whole lives for him without asking for anything in return. Serebryakov goes offstage and a shot is fired. He comes back in, and Vanya shoots at him one more time. He misses both times, and gives up on his mission.","Set in the daytime, Act III opens in the drawing room with Voynitsky and Sonya seated as Yelena paces in thought. The professor has called a meeting at one o'clock. After grumbling about Serebryakov, Voynitsky attacks Yelena, describing her as ready to \"drop from sheer laziness\". Yelena replies that she is dying of boredom and is without an idea of what to do. Sonya produces a number of possibilities: help with the estate, teaching, nursing, and so on. Yelena cannot imagine being interested; only people in ideological novels undertake such work. For Sonya, Yelena's idleness is \"infectious\"--her effect on Vanya, herself, and the doctor, all of whom having deserted their work to follow her, make this clear. Yelena is certainly a witch. Voynitsky adds that she must have the blood of a mermaid and should flee the estate by diving into a whirlpool with some water sprite. Yelena is enraged: Voynitsky offers to pick her a bouquet of roses in apology and exits. Sadly Sonya then puts her head on Yelena's breast and once again begins pining for the doctor. Having loved him for six years, she has lost all pride and confessed her love to everyone except Astrov. Remarking that he is a strange person, Yelena resolves to find out what he thinks of Sonya, using his cartograms as a pretext. Sonya pauses for a moment, wondering if uncertainty is better and exits to fetch him. Yelena then delivers a soliloquy, ruminating on how Sonya cannot help falling for such a \"fascinating\" man amidst such boredom and admits her own fascination for the doctor. Recalling Vanya's quip about the mermaid, she wonders if she should flee with him--her conscience, however, prevents it. Indeed, she already feels guilty, ready to prostrate herself before Sonya and weep. Astrov then enters with a cartogram and proceeds to explain the progressive degeneration of the region. Forests, settlements, and wildlife have disappeared in the \"downhill struggle for existence\"; instead of progress, the same swamps, diseases, and disasters remain. It is clear to Astrov that Yelena is uninterested. He breaks off, and she cross-examines him with regards to Sonya. Astrov does not love her. He is, however, convinced that the subtext of Yelena's cross-examination is her own desire and that she is finally responding to his longtime advances. Much to Yelena's dismay, he embraces her passionately and insists upon arranging a rendezvous. Yelena resists, and suddenly Voynitsky enters unseen. For a moment, Yelena will then relent, laying her head on Astrov's chest. Just as the doctor proposes a rendezvous, however, she sees Voynitsky and disengages herself from his arms. Astrov chats about the weather, noting that the days are getting shorter, and he exits. Nervously, Yelena insists that Voynitsky prevail upon her husband for an immediate departure from the estate; a shaken Voynitsky replies that he has seen everything."],"next summary id":"act 4","next chapter":"In Vanya's room, Telegin and Marina sit and wind wool to make stockings.

Chekhov describes it at length in his stage notes: a large table stands by the window, piled with account books and papers; Astrov's drawing table sits to the side; a map of Africa hangs on the wall. Telegin and Marina sit opposite each other, winding stocking wool. Again an unspecified period of time has passed; it is still autumn. Through the conversation of the nurse and landowner, we learn that Yelena and the professor are departing that evening for Kharkov, not even bothering to pack their things. Marina is relieved that the household will resume its routine. She then asks after Sonya--apparently she is searching for Voynitsky in the garden with Dr. Astrov, fearful that her father might injure himself. Voynitsky and Astrov then enter, and the former orders the Marina and Telegin out. Astrov asks Voynitsky to return what he took from him, threatening to use force if necessary. Voynitsky responds that Astrov can do what he likes as his friend is now nothing but a fool, a madman. Ironically, he notes that though he might be mad, no one would ever consider a sham professor or treacherous wife mad. He also accuses Astrov of infidelity with Yelena . Astrov thumbs his nose. The conversation continues: for Astrov, Voynitsky is not mad but \\\"simply eccentric\\\" and, indeed, \\\"being eccentric is the normal condition of mankind.\\\" Suddenly Voynitsky buries his face in shame, repeating the refrain from the act previous: \\\"What can I do?\\\" He dreads the many empty years to come, dreaming of a new life and begging Astrov to help him start one. Annoyed, Astrov tells him he can do nothing, that his situation is hopeless, and that, though they were once the only decent, educated men in the district, provincial life has poisoned them both. Astrov then renews his request for what Voynitsky has stolen, which is apparently a bottle of morphine. Voynitsky can shoot himself if he feels suicidal, but morphine would unnecessarily implicate the doctor. Sonya then enters, and the doctor appeals to her for help. After his daughter pleads with him, Voynitsky surrenders the bottle and crumbles. Astrov prepares to leave.\", \"analysis\": \"These final scenes are significant as they show Uncle Vanya asking for redemption; all too clearly, this redemption brusquely is denied to him. Intimately related to this final blow are the themes and motifs we have discussed thus far: estrangement, the memory of a wasted life, and so on. Voynitsky concludes that he is a madman and a fool. Astrov retorts that Voynitsky is not mad but \\\"simply eccentric\\\"--as Astrov himself has been described throughout the play. Though Astrov once considered eccentricity \\\"sick and abnormal\\\", he has come to realize it is the \\\"normal condition of mankind.\\\" As we have noted throughout, \\\"eccentricity\\\" refers in this play to an estrangement from both others and oneself. Thus, though the characters here might not be mad, we can certainly identify them they as doubly alienated in the manner described above. This estrangement is now a condition of existence. Voynitsky also brings up the subject of time and memory, begging the doctor for a new life. To quote: \\\"If you could wake up one clear, quiet morning and feel that you're beginning your life over again, that the entire past is forgotten, scattered to the winds like smoke.\\\" In begging for a new life, Voynitsky would escape his monotonous existence and make the memory of his wasted life disappear. Astrov, however, has no words of solace. Indeed, apparently no longer the visionary we saw in Act I, he remarks that the only happy visions one can hope for are those that may come in the grave. As we will see, Astrov's sentence, condemning Vanya to his misery, prefigures Sonya's similarly fatalistic speech at the end of the play. These final moments will above all reveal how a rebirth for Vanya is impossible-only drudgery awaits him. Indeed, the restoration of daily routine is already prefigured here, not only by the interlude between Marina and Telegin that precedes their conversation, but by Chekhov's detailed description of his office as well. was a famous painter of seascapes.]\"}","chapter":"ACT IV\n\nVOITSKI'S bedroom, which is also his office. A table stands near\nthe window; on it are ledgers, letter scales, and papers of every\ndescription. Near by stands a smaller table belonging to ASTROFF, with\nhis paints and drawing materials. On the wall hangs a cage containing a\nstarling. There is also a map of Africa on the wall, obviously of no use\nto anybody. There is a large sofa covered with buckram. A door to the\nleft leads into an inner room; one to the right leads into the front\nhall, and before this door lies a mat for the peasants with their muddy\nboots to stand on. It is an autumn evening. The silence is profound.\nTELEGIN and MARINA are sitting facing one another, winding wool.\n\nTELEGIN.

It seems, Marina, that fate has\ndecreed for them not to live here.\n\nMARINA. And quite rightly. What a storm they have just raised! It was\nshameful!\n\nTELEGIN. It was indeed.

When the impulse came to shoot, it would have been as well had\nyou put a bullet through your own head.\n\nVOITSKI. [Shrugging his shoulders] Strange! I attempted murder, and am\nnot going to be arrested or brought to trial. That means they think\nme mad. [With a bitter laugh] Me! I am mad, and those who hide their\nworthlessness, their dullness, their crying heartlessness behind a\nprofessor's mask, are sane! Those who marry old men and then deceive\nthem under the noses of all, are sane! I saw you kiss her; I saw you in\neach other's arms!\n\nASTROFF. Yes, sir, I did kiss her; so there.

Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible? Haven't I\nthe right to talk nonsense?\n\nASTROFF. This is a farce! You are not mad; you are simply a ridiculous\nfool. I used to think every fool was out of his senses, but now I\nsee that lack of sense is a man's normal state, and you are perfectly\nnormal.\n\nVOITSKI. [Covers his face with his hands] Oh! If you knew how ashamed\nI am! These piercing pangs of shame are like nothing on earth. [In an\nagonised voice] I can't endure them! [He leans against the table] What\ncan I do? What can I do?\n\nASTROFF. Nothing.\n\nVOITSKI. You must tell me something! Oh, my God! I am forty-seven years\nold. I may live to sixty; I still have thirteen years before me; an\neternity! How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?\nWhat shall I do? How can I fill them? Oh, don't you see?

If I could only wake some still, bright\nmorning and feel that life had begun again; that the past was forgotten\nand had vanished like smoke. [He weeps] Oh, to begin life anew! Tell me,\ntell me how to begin.\n\nASTROFF. [Crossly] What nonsense! What sort of a new life can you and I\nlook forward to? We can have no hope.\n\nVOITSKI. None?\n\nASTROFF. None. Of that I am convinced.\n\nVOITSKI. Tell me what to do. [He puts his hand to his heart] I feel such\na burning pain here.\n\nASTROFF. [Shouts angrily] Stop! [Then, more gently] It may be that\nposterity, which will despise us for our blind and stupid lives, will\nfind some road to happiness; but we--you and I--have but one hope, the\nhope that we may be visited by visions, perhaps by pleasant ones, as we\nlie resting in our graves. [Sighing] Yes, brother, there were only two\nrespectable, intelligent men in this county, you and I. Ten years or so\nof this life of ours, this miserable life, have sucked us under, and we\nhave become as contemptible and petty as the rest. But don't try to talk\nme out of my purpose! Give me what you took from me, will you?\n\nVOITSKI. I took nothing from you.\n\nASTROFF. You took a little bottle of morphine out of my medicine-case.\n[A pause] Listen! If you are positively determined to make an end\nto yourself, go into the woods and shoot yourself there. Give up the\nmorphine, or there will be a lot of talk and guesswork; people will\nthink I gave it to you. I don't fancy having to perform a post-mortem on\nyou. Do you think I should find it interesting?\n\nSONIA comes in.\n\nVOITSKI. Leave me alone.\n\nASTROFF. [To SONIA] Sonia, your uncle has stolen a bottle of morphine\nout of my medicine-case and won't give it up. Tell him that his\nbehaviour is--well, unwise. I haven't time, I must be going.\n\nSONIA. Uncle Vanya, did you take the morphine?\n\nASTROFF. Yes, he took it. [A pause] I am absolutely sure.\n\nSONIA. Give it up! Why do you want to frighten us? [Tenderly] Give it\nup, Uncle Vanya! My misfortune is perhaps even greater than yours, but I\nam not plunged in despair. I endure my sorrow, and shall endure it until\nmy life comes to a natural end. You must endure yours, too. [A pause]\nGive it up! Dear, darling Uncle Vanya. Give it up! [She weeps] You are\nso good, I am sure you will have pity on us and give it up. You must\nendure your sorrow, Uncle Vanya; you must endure it.\n\nVOITSKI takes a bottle from the drawer of the table and hands it to\nASTROFF.\n\nVOITSKI. There it is! [To SONIA] And now, we must get to work at once;\nwe must do something, or else I shall not be able to endure it.\n\nSONIA. Yes, yes, to work! As soon as we have seen them off we shall\ngo to work. [She nervously straightens out the papers on the table]\nEverything is in a muddle!\n\nASTROFF. [Putting the bottle in his case, which he straps together] Now\nI can be off.\n\nHELENA comes in.\n\nHELENA. Are you here, Ivan? We are starting in a moment. Go to\nAlexander, he wants to speak to you.\n\nSONIA. Go, Uncle Vanya. [She takes VOITSKI 'S arm] Come, you and papa\nmust make peace; that is absolutely necessary.\n\nSONIA and VOITSKI go out.\n\nHELENA. I am going away. [She gives ASTROFF her hand] Good-bye.\n\nASTROFF. So soon?\n\nHELENA. The carriage is waiting.\n\nASTROFF. Good-bye.\n\nHELENA. You promised me you would go away yourself to-day.\n\nASTROFF. I have not forgotten. I am going at once. [A pause] Were you\nfrightened? Was it so terrible?\n\nHELENA. Yes.\n\nASTROFF. Couldn't you stay? Couldn't you? To-morrow--in the forest--\n\nHELENA. No. It is all settled, and that is why I can look you so bravely\nin the face. Our departure is fixed. One thing I must ask of you: don't\nthink too badly of me; I should like you to respect me.\n\nASTROFF. Ah! [With an impatient gesture] Stay, I implore you! Confess\nthat there is nothing for you to do in this world. You have no object\nin life; there is nothing to occupy your attention, and sooner or later\nyour feelings must master you. It is inevitable. It would be better if\nit happened not in Kharkoff or in Kursk, but here, in nature's lap.\nIt would then at least be poetical, even beautiful. Here you have the\nforests, the houses half in ruins that Turgenieff writes of.\n\nHELENA. How comical you are! I am angry with you and yet I shall always\nremember you with pleasure. You are interesting and original. You and\nI will never meet again, and so I shall tell you--why should I conceal\nit?--that I am just a little in love with you. Come, one more last\npressure of our hands, and then let us part good friends. Let us not\nbear each other any ill will.\n\nASTROFF. [Pressing her hand] Yes, go. [Thoughtfully] You seem to be\nsincere and good, and yet there is something strangely disquieting about\nall your personality. No sooner did you arrive here with your husband\nthan every one whom you found busy and actively creating something was\nforced to drop his work and give himself up for the whole summer to\nyour husband's gout and yourself. You and he have infected us with your\nidleness. I have been swept off my feet; I have not put my hand to\na thing for weeks, during which sickness has been running its course\nunchecked among the people, and the peasants have been pasturing their\ncattle in my woods and young plantations. Go where you will, you and\nyour husband will always carry destruction in your train. I am joking of\ncourse, and yet I am strangely sure that had you stayed here we should\nhave been overtaken by the most immense desolation. I would have gone\nto my ruin, and you--you would not have prospered. So go! E finita la\ncomedia!\n\nHELENA. [Snatching a pencil off ASTROFF'S table, and hiding it with a\nquick movement] I shall take this pencil for memory!\n\nASTROFF. How strange it is. We meet, and then suddenly it seems that\nwe must part forever. That is the way in this world. As long as we are\nalone, before Uncle Vanya comes in with a bouquet--allow me--to kiss you\ngood-bye--may I? [He kisses her on the cheek] So! Splendid!\n\nHELENA. I wish you every happiness. [She glances about her] For once\nin my life, I shall! and scorn the consequences! [She kisses him\nimpetuously, and they quickly part] I must go.\n\nASTROFF. Yes, go. If the carriage is there, then start at once. [They\nstand listening.]\n\nASTROFF. E finita!\n\nVOITSKI, SEREBRAKOFF, MME. VOITSKAYA with her book, TELEGIN, and SONIA\ncome in.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [To VOITSKI] Shame on him who bears malice for the past. I\nhave gone through so much in the last few hours that I feel capable of\nwriting a whole treatise on the conduct of life for the instruction\nof posterity. I gladly accept your apology, and myself ask your\nforgiveness. [He kisses VOITSKI three times.]\n\nHELENA embraces SONIA.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [Kissing MME. VOITSKAYA'S hand] Mother!\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA. [Kissing him] Have your picture taken, Alexander, and\nsend me one. You know how dear you are to me.\n\nTELEGIN. Good-bye, your Excellency. Don't forget us.\n\nSEREBRAKOFF. [Kissing his daughter] Good-bye, good-bye all. [Shaking\nhands with ASTROFF] Many thanks for your pleasant company. I have a deep\nregard for your opinions and your enthusiasm, but let me, as an old man,\ngive one word of advice at parting: do something, my friend! Work! Do\nsomething! [They all bow] Good luck to you all. [He goes out followed by\nMME. VOITSKAYA and SONIA.]\n\nVOITSKI [Kissing HELENA'S hand fervently] Good-bye--forgive me. I shall\nnever see you again!\n\nHELENA. [Touched] Good-bye, dear boy.\n\nShe lightly kisses his head as he bends over her hand, and goes out.\n\nASTROFF. Tell them to bring my carriage around too, Waffles.\n\nTELEGIN. All right, old man.\n\nASTROFF and VOITSKI are left behind alone. ASTROFF collects his paints\nand drawing materials on the table and packs them away in a box.\n\nASTROFF. Why don't you go to see them off?\n\nVOITSKI. Let them go! I--I can't go out there. I feel too sad. I must go\nto work on something at once. To work! To work!\n\nHe rummages through his papers on the table. A pause. The tinkling of\nbells is heard as the horses trot away.\n\nASTROFF. They have gone! The professor, I suppose, is glad to go. He\ncouldn't be tempted back now by a fortune.\n\nMARINA comes in.\n\nMARINA. They have gone. [She sits down in an arm-chair and knits her\nstocking.]\n\nSONIA comes in wiping her eyes.\n\nSONIA. They have gone. God be with them. [To her uncle] And now, Uncle\nVanya, let us do something!\n\nVOITSKI. To work! To work!\n\nSONIA. It is long, long, since you and I have sat together at this\ntable. [She lights a lamp on the table] No ink! [She takes the inkstand\nto the cupboard and fills it from an ink-bottle] How sad it is to see\nthem go!\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA comes slowly in.\n\nMME. VOITSKAYA. They have gone.\n\nShe sits down and at once becomes absorbed in her book. SONIA sits down\nat the table and looks through an account book.\n\nSONIA. First, Uncle Vanya, let us write up the accounts. They are in a\ndreadful state. Come, begin. You take one and I will take the other.\n\nVOITSKI. In account with [They sit silently writing.]\n\nMARINA. [Yawning] The sand-man has come.\n\nASTROFF. How still it is. Their pens scratch, the cricket sings; it is\nso warm and comfortable. I hate to go. [The tinkling of bells is heard.]\n\nASTROFF. My carriage has come. There now remains but to say good-bye to\nyou, my friends, and to my table here, and then--away! [He puts the map\ninto the portfolio.]\n\nMARINA. Don't hurry away; sit a little longer with us.\n\nASTROFF. Impossible.\n\nVOITSKI. [Writing] And carry forward from the old debt two\nseventy-five--\n\nWORKMAN comes in.\n\nWORKMAN. Your carriage is waiting, sir.\n\nASTROFF. All right. [He hands the WORKMAN his medicine-case, portfolio,\nand box] Look out, don't crush the portfolio!\n\nWORKMAN. Very well, sir.\n\nSONIA. When shall we see you again?\n\nASTROFF. Hardly before next summer. Probably not this winter, though, of\ncourse, if anything should happen you will let me know. [He shakes\nhands with them] Thank you for your kindness, for your hospitality, for\neverything! [He goes up to MARINA and kisses her head] Good-bye, old\nnurse!\n\nMARINA. Are you going without your tea?\n\nASTROFF. I don't want any, nurse.\n\nMARINA. Won't you have a drop of vodka?\n\nASTROFF. [Hesitatingly] Yes, I might.\n\nMARINA goes out.\n\nASTROFF. [After a pause] My off-wheeler has gone lame for some reason. I\nnoticed it yesterday when Peter was taking him to water.\n\nVOITSKI. You should have him re-shod.\n\nASTROFF. I shall have to go around by the blacksmith's on my way home.\nIt can't be avoided. [He stands looking up at the map of Africa hanging\non the wall] I suppose it is roasting hot in Africa now.\n\nVOITSKI. Yes, I suppose it is.\n\nMARINA comes back carrying a tray on which are a glass of vodka and a\npiece of bread.\n\nMARINA. Help yourself.\n\nASTROFF drinks\n\nMARINA. To your good health! [She bows deeply] Eat your bread with it.\n\nASTROFF. No, I like it so. And now, good-bye. [To MARINA] You needn't\ncome out to see me off, nurse.\n\nHe goes out. SONIA follows him with a candle to light him to the\ncarriage. MARINA sits down in her armchair.\n\nVOITSKI. [Writing] On the 2d of February, twenty pounds of butter; on\nthe 16th, twenty pounds of butter again. Buckwheat flour--[A pause.\nBells are heard tinkling.]\n\nMARINA. He has gone. [A pause.]\n\nSONIA comes in and sets the candle stick on the table.\n\nSONIA. He has gone.\n\nVOITSKI. [Adding and writing] Total, fifteen--twenty-five--\n\nSONIA sits down and begins to write.\n\n[Yawning] Oh, ho! The Lord have mercy.\n\nTELEGIN comes in on tiptoe, sits down near the door, and begins to tune\nhis guitar.\n\nVOITSKI. [To SONIA, stroking her hair] Oh, my child, I am miserable; if\nyou only knew how miserable I am!\n\nSONIA. What can we do? We must live our lives. [A pause] Yes, we shall\nlive, Uncle Vanya. We shall live through the long procession of days\nbefore us, and through the long evenings; we shall patiently bear the\ntrials that fate imposes on us; we shall work for others without rest,\nboth now and when we are old; and when our last hour comes we shall\nmeet it humbly, and there, beyond the grave, we shall say that we have\nsuffered and wept, that our life was bitter, and God will have pity on\nus. Ah, then dear, dear Uncle, we shall see that bright and beautiful\nlife; we shall rejoice and look back upon our sorrow here; a tender\nsmile--and--we shall rest. I have faith, Uncle, fervent, passionate\nfaith. [SONIA kneels down before her uncle and lays her head on his\nhands. She speaks in a weary voice] We shall rest. [TELEGIN plays softly\non the guitar] We shall rest. We shall hear the angels. We shall see\nheaven shining like a jewel. We shall see all evil and all our pain sink\naway in the great compassion that shall enfold the world. Our life will\nbe as peaceful and tender and sweet as a caress. I have faith; I have\nfaith. [She wipes away her tears] My poor, poor Uncle Vanya, you are\ncrying! [Weeping] You have never known what happiness was, but wait,\nUncle Vanya, wait! We shall rest. [She embraces him] We shall rest. [The\nWATCHMAN'S rattle is heard in the garden; TELEGIN plays softly; MME.\nVOITSKAYA writes something on the margin of her pamphlet; MARINA knits\nher stocking] We shall rest.\n\nThe curtain slowly falls.\n\n","chapter_length":2974.0,"summary_name":"Act IV - Part One","summary_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210227035013\/https:\/\/www.sparknotes.com\/drama\/unclevanya\/section7\/","summary_text":"Act IV is set in Voynitsky's bedroom, which doubles as the estate office. Chekhov describes it at length in his stage notes: a large table stands by the window, piled with account books and papers; Astrov's drawing table sits to the side; a map of Africa hangs on the wall. Telegin and Marina sit opposite each other, winding stocking wool. Again an unspecified period of time has passed; it is still autumn. Through the conversation of the nurse and landowner, we learn that Yelena and the professor are departing that evening for Kharkov, not even bothering to pack their things. Marina is relieved that the household will resume its routine. She then asks after Sonya--apparently she is searching for Voynitsky in the garden with Dr. Astrov, fearful that her father might injure himself. Voynitsky and Astrov then enter, and the former orders the Marina and Telegin out. Astrov asks Voynitsky to return what he took from him, threatening to use force if necessary. Voynitsky responds that Astrov can do what he likes as his friend is now nothing but a fool, a madman. Ironically, he notes that though he might be mad, no one would ever consider a sham professor or treacherous wife mad. He also accuses Astrov of infidelity with Yelena . Astrov thumbs his nose. The conversation continues: for Astrov, Voynitsky is not mad but \"simply eccentric\" and, indeed, \"being eccentric is the normal condition of mankind.\" Suddenly Voynitsky buries his face in shame, repeating the refrain from the act previous: \"What can I do?\" He dreads the many empty years to come, dreaming of a new life and begging Astrov to help him start one. Annoyed, Astrov tells him he can do nothing, that his situation is hopeless, and that, though they were once the only decent, educated men in the district, provincial life has poisoned them both. Astrov then renews his request for what Voynitsky has stolen, which is apparently a bottle of morphine. Voynitsky can shoot himself if he feels suicidal, but morphine would unnecessarily implicate the doctor. Sonya then enters, and the doctor appeals to her for help. After his daughter pleads with him, Voynitsky surrenders the bottle and crumbles. Astrov prepares to leave.","summary_analysis":"These final scenes are significant as they show Uncle Vanya asking for redemption; all too clearly, this redemption brusquely is denied to him. Intimately related to this final blow are the themes and motifs we have discussed thus far: estrangement, the memory of a wasted life, and so on. Voynitsky concludes that he is a madman and a fool. Astrov retorts that Voynitsky is not mad but \"simply eccentric\"--as Astrov himself has been described throughout the play. Though Astrov once considered eccentricity \"sick and abnormal\", he has come to realize it is the \"normal condition of mankind.\" As we have noted throughout, \"eccentricity\" refers in this play to an estrangement from both others and oneself. Thus, though the characters here might not be mad, we can certainly identify them they as doubly alienated in the manner described above. This estrangement is now a condition of existence. Voynitsky also brings up the subject of time and memory, begging the doctor for a new life. To quote: \"If you could wake up one clear, quiet morning and feel that you're beginning your life over again, that the entire past is forgotten, scattered to the winds like smoke.\" In begging for a new life, Voynitsky would escape his monotonous existence and make the memory of his wasted life disappear. Astrov, however, has no words of solace. Indeed, apparently no longer the visionary we saw in Act I, he remarks that the only happy visions one can hope for are those that may come in the grave. As we will see, Astrov's sentence, condemning Vanya to his misery, prefigures Sonya's similarly fatalistic speech at the end of the play. These final moments will above all reveal how a rebirth for Vanya is impossible-only drudgery awaits him. Indeed, the restoration of daily routine is already prefigured here, not only by the interlude between Marina and Telegin that precedes their conversation, but by Chekhov's detailed description of his office as well. was a famous painter of seascapes.]","summary_length":370.0,"analysis_length":331.0,"chap_int":4,"previous summary id":["act iii","act 3","act iii"],"previous chapter":["In the drawing room, Vanya and Sonya sit; Helen, deep in thought, walks up to them. Vanya complains to the ladies that Serebryakov wants to speak to them, no doubt about something pointless. He mocks Helen for her charming laziness, and Helen furrows her brow. She tells him to stop and says that she is excessively bored. Sonya suggests that there are plenty of things for her to do, such as working on the farm, or teaching, or nursing. Helen simply replies that she cannot to do that sort of thing. Sonya tells her that her boredom is infectious, and that she could certainly teach. Vanya sneers that Helen has mermaid's blood and ought to just fall into the river with a river-god. Helen is angry, even when Vanya apologizes and kisses her hand. She wonders how they will ever get through the winter. After Vanya leaves, Sonya confides in Helen that she is sad that she is not beautiful. Helen compliments her hair, but this does not comfort Sonya. She loves Astrov's voice, his hand, and the sound of him arriving at the house, but he doesn't seem to even notice her. Helen thoughtfully says she will talk to him on her behalf; Sonya is pleased but a bit agitated, and makes Helen promise to tell her exactly what he says. Helen does; the plan is for Sonya to tell Astrov that Helen wants to see his maps. After Sonya departs, Helen muses aloud that Astrov certainly does not love Sonya; however, even though she is not beautiful, she would make him a good wife because she is clever and unspoiled. Helen feels like she understands Sonya, and she certainly understands ghastly boredom and how Astrov's occasional appearance enlivens that boredom. He is different from the others and is like a \"bright moon rising in the darkness\" . Helen sighs that she wishes she could fly away like a bird from all of this, but she is too much of a coward to leave. Astrov enters with his maps, happily asking if she wants to see them. Astrov spreads them out; as he does so, he asks where she is from and where she was educated. He wonders if she could actually be interested in this; Helen responds that she might not know much about country life, but she has read a lot. Astrov begins to speak about the maps, a pleasure he allows himself only once a month. The first map, he begins, is the district fifty years ago. Half the area was wooded. The land featured small isolated hamlets and a great deal of birds and cattle and horses. Twenty-five years ago, though, some of the animals were gone, and only a third of the area was wooded. Old hamlets and farmsteads vanished, and the \"general picture is one of a gradual and unmistakable decline\" . Things have certainly worsened over the last years. Astrov pauses and says that if people had built roads and railways instead of simply destroying the forests, or had erected factories and schools, then the peasants would be better off and happier. However, this did not happen: the district is still mosquito-laden, poor, and prone to fires and disease. People find the struggle for existence difficult, he says: they are backward, ignorant, and have no idea what they're doing. A man's only instinct is to be warm and fed, and he does not think about the future. Astrov looks at Helen and coldly comments that she is bored. She replies that she understands little, but he denies this: she is just not interested. Helen asks if she can change the subject, so they sit down and asks bluntly about Sonya--does she attract him as a woman? He answers no. Helen sighs and says that Sonya is so unhappy, and that he ought to stop coming here. Astrov, annoyed, stands up. Helen feels that this is a disagreeable conversation and is wearied by it. She tells them that they ought to pretend like nothing was said. Astrov stares at her and asks why she brought it up. He shrugs but then regards her more carefully and comments that she is a little box of tricks. Helen is confused, and he laughs that she has it all figured out. He presses on and says she knows perfectly well why he comes here, that she's a little vampire, and that he is not new to this. Helen is still confused, and Astrov smiles that she is a beautiful little weasel. He bows his head and mockingly says that he surrenders. Helen is surprised, calls him crazy, and moves to leave, but he bars her way and takes her hand. He moves closer and passionately begs her to let him kiss her. He kisses her hand as she tries to pull away. He leans in, imploring her to tell him when they can meet, and he kisses her as Vanya walks in. Helen does not see Vanya, but she tells Astrov to leave her alone. He insists that she meet him at the forest reservation, but she still tries to extricate herself, especially once she notices Vanya. Vanya is carrying roses and puts them down. Astrov bitterly talks about the weather as he rolls up the maps. Helen runs up to Vanya and says he must do all he can to get her husband and her away from this house. Vanya is distracted but says \"of course.\" Serebryakov, Sonya, Telegin, and Marina enter. Serebryakov complains about the house. As her father prepares to speak, Sonya goes up to Helen and asks what Astrov said. Helen only says she will tell her later, and Sonya trembles and asks if he said he wasn't going to come anymore. Helen nods. Serebryakov tells everyone to sit down and Vanya asks in an annoyed, agitated tone if he is needed. Serebryakov tells him that he obviously is, and he wonders why he is acting like this. He begins his speech a moment later, explaining that he needs everyone's advice. He is old now and has to think about putting his affairs in order. It is impossible for him to live in the country, and the estate's income will not support them in the city. It is his proposal that they sell the estate, which would allow for a smaller cottage near St. Petersburg. Vanya is stunned and asks what Serebryakov thinks he, Mrs. Voynitksy, and Sonya will do. Serebryakov replies that they will figure that out in time. Vanya shakes his head, saying that he thought all this time that this was Sonya's estate. Serebryakov replies that it is, and that he would do this in her best interest. This does not comfort Vanya, even though Mrs. Voynitsky suggests listening to the professor. Serebryakov doesn't understand why people are upset, and Vanya interrupts clueless Telegin's comments to explain angrily how he gave up part of his inheritance so that his sister could buy this land. Furthermore, it is free from debt because he, Vanya, has worked so hard on it for twenty-five years. All this time, Serebryakov has neither thanked him nor given him an extra ruble. Telegin and Mrs. Voynitsky try to calm Vanya down but he continues, saying how he used to revere the professor's writing and books but how he now despises them. He says they used to think of the professor as superior, but now he sees that he knows nothing of the art he writes about. Serebryakov is still confused and Helen tries to calm Vanya down. Serebryakov tells Vanya that, if he wants the estate, it is his. Telegin runs out in distress. Helen shouts that she can't stand this. Vanya moans that his life is ruined, and that he could have been a Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky but for Serebryakov; he feels like he is going mad. Sonya leans before Marina in anguish. Vanya calls out to his mother, then announces he knows what to do, and runs out. Serebryakov proclaims he does not know what is wrong with Vanya, and Helen insists they must leave today. Sonya turns to her father and begs him to understand that she and her uncle are so unhappy and worked so hard for him their whole lives. Helen tells her husband that she must sort this out. Grudgingly, Serebryakov leaves to talk to Vanya with Helen following. Marina comforts Sonya. Suddenly, a shot is heard; Helen's scream follows. Serebryakov staggers back in, shouting about Vanya's madness. Helen and Vanya struggle over a revolver. Vanya bests her and fires again at Serebryakov but misses. He tries again and misses. He curses and sinks into a chair. Helen leans against a wall, her chest heaving. She says she must leave. Vanya wonders desperately what he is doing, and Sonya cries for Nanny.","In the daytime, Vanya, Sonya, and Yelena are gathered in the drawing room, waiting for Serebryakov, who has an announcement for them. Yelena says she's bored, and Sonya insists that she just needs something to keep herself busy because she's infecting everyone with her laziness. Vanya leaves and Sonya tells Yelena that she's dying of love for Astrov. Yelena promises to talk to him and find out if he feels the same way. Yelena says that it will be better to be certain, though Sonya isn't sure. She thinks that with uncertainty she at least still has hope. When Yelena approaches Astrov about Sonya, however, he just starts talking about the decay of society and civilization. Yelena finally gets her chance to ask Astrov about Sonya, and when he confirms that he doesn't love her, Yelena asks him to stop coming around so that he won't torture the poor girl anymore. Astrov misunderstands Yelena's intentions and thinks that she is the one who has a crush on him. He tries to kiss her, and just then Vanya walks in with a bouquet of flowers and sees Yelena struggling. The plot thickens. Yelena asks Vanya to help her get out of the country house. She wants to leave that very day. Finally, Serebryakov shows up to make his announcement. As his speech begins, Sonya can tell by Yelena's actions that Astrov doesn't love her. Serebryakov reveals that he's in financial doo doo. He doesn't have enough money to live in the city, but he hates living in the country. So he's going to sell the estate and move to Finland. Vanya is pretty ticked off at this proposal since he, his mother, and his niece, Sonya, won't have anywhere to go. He explains that the estate had belonged to his sister, and that he gave up his own inheritance to buy it for her. Now that he's worked for years keeping it running, his former brother-in-law wants to sell it out from under him. The family meeting turns into a shouting match, with Vanya and Yelena as the main maniacs. Sonya begs her father to have mercy on Vanya, reminding him that she, her uncle, and her grandmother worked their whole lives for him without asking for anything in return. Serebryakov goes offstage and a shot is fired. He comes back in, and Vanya shoots at him one more time. He misses both times, and gives up on his mission.","Set in the daytime, Act III opens in the drawing room with Voynitsky and Sonya seated as Yelena paces in thought. The professor has called a meeting at one o'clock. After grumbling about Serebryakov, Voynitsky attacks Yelena, describing her as ready to \"drop from sheer laziness\". Yelena replies that she is dying of boredom and is without an idea of what to do. Sonya produces a number of possibilities: help with the estate, teaching, nursing, and so on. Yelena cannot imagine being interested; only people in ideological novels undertake such work. For Sonya, Yelena's idleness is \"infectious\"--her effect on Vanya, herself, and the doctor, all of whom having deserted their work to follow her, make this clear. Yelena is certainly a witch. Voynitsky adds that she must have the blood of a mermaid and should flee the estate by diving into a whirlpool with some water sprite. Yelena is enraged: Voynitsky offers to pick her a bouquet of roses in apology and exits. Sadly Sonya then puts her head on Yelena's breast and once again begins pining for the doctor. Having loved him for six years, she has lost all pride and confessed her love to everyone except Astrov. Remarking that he is a strange person, Yelena resolves to find out what he thinks of Sonya, using his cartograms as a pretext. Sonya pauses for a moment, wondering if uncertainty is better and exits to fetch him. Yelena then delivers a soliloquy, ruminating on how Sonya cannot help falling for such a \"fascinating\" man amidst such boredom and admits her own fascination for the doctor. Recalling Vanya's quip about the mermaid, she wonders if she should flee with him--her conscience, however, prevents it. Indeed, she already feels guilty, ready to prostrate herself before Sonya and weep. Astrov then enters with a cartogram and proceeds to explain the progressive degeneration of the region. Forests, settlements, and wildlife have disappeared in the \"downhill struggle for existence\"; instead of progress, the same swamps, diseases, and disasters remain. It is clear to Astrov that Yelena is uninterested. He breaks off, and she cross-examines him with regards to Sonya. Astrov does not love her. He is, however, convinced that the subtext of Yelena's cross-examination is her own desire and that she is finally responding to his longtime advances. Much to Yelena's dismay, he embraces her passionately and insists upon arranging a rendezvous. Yelena resists, and suddenly Voynitsky enters unseen. For a moment, Yelena will then relent, laying her head on Astrov's chest. Just as the doctor proposes a rendezvous, however, she sees Voynitsky and disengages herself from his arms. Astrov chats about the weather, noting that the days are getting shorter, and he exits. Nervously, Yelena insists that Voynitsky prevail upon her husband for an immediate departure from the estate; a shaken Voynitsky replies that he has seen everything."],"next summary id":"act iv","next chapter":"Act IV is set in Voynitsky's bedroom, which doubles as the estate office.

Annoyed, Astrov tells him he can do nothing, that his situation is hopeless, and that, though they were once the only decent, educated men in the district, provincial life has poisoned them both. Astrov then renews his request for what Voynitsky has stolen, which is apparently a bottle of morphine. Voynitsky can shoot himself if he feels suicidal, but morphine would unnecessarily implicate the doctor. Sonya then enters, and the doctor appeals to her for help. After his daughter pleads with him, Voynitsky surrenders the bottle and crumbles. Astrov prepares to leave."}

Sir Oliver is disguised as Mr. Stanley, Joseph's poor relative. Joseph refuses to help Stanley financially, claiming that he has no money, even though Sir Oliver sent him a large sum of money from India. Sir Oliver is angered by this and declares, \\\"Charles! You are my heir\\\" as he exits. After \\\"Mr. Stanley\\\" leaves, Rowley returns and tells Joseph that his uncle has arrived in town. Joseph asks Rowley to stop Mr. Stanley, but Rowley says he thinks it won't be possible. Joseph is still upset that all this business is happening at such an inopportune time, but he is excited to see his uncle. Scene II takes place at Sir Peter's house. Lady Sneerwell, Mrs. Candour, Sir Benjamin, and eventually Crabtree talk about the rumors surrounding Lady Teazle. The rumors are blown out of proportion as they report to one another that Charles and Sir Peter supposedly dueled with either swords or guns. Lady Sneerwell hides her involvement in the issue somewhat, and leaves the group discussing the rumor. Soon after Lady Sneerwell leaves, Sir Oliver arrives at the house. They believe him to be the doctor, present to tend to Sir Peter's wound from the supposed duel. Sir Oliver tells them he is not a doctor, calling attention to the differences in the stories he is being told--the parties still not agreeing on whether the wound came from a sword or a bullet. Sir Peter then arrives and everyone makes a fuss about him not being wounded after all. The group makes fun of him and he throws them out of his house, telling them he wants neither their jokes nor their pity. Finally, only Sir Oliver remains, and Rowley returns. Sir Oliver tells Sir Peter about his visits with both nephews. Sir Oliver also says that he too has heard the story of Sir Peter, Lady Teazle, Joseph, and Charles, and laughs at his friend. They all laugh together, and Sir Peter laments without much feeling how the gossip will continue to circulate through the papers. Sir Oliver leaves so that Sir Peter can reconcile with his wife. Rowley and Sir Peter discuss how badly Lady Teazle is feeling about what happened and Sir Peter suggests that he might leave her to feel bad for a while instead of going to speak to her. Rowley chides him, and Sir Peter agrees to go make up with her. Lady Sneerwell and Joseph meet to discuss whether Sir Peter will now reconcile with Charles and let him marry Maria. Lady Sneerwell scolds him for ruining the plot. Joseph suggests that if Snake is still faithful to them, it may not be too late. They hear a knocking at the door; Joseph thinks this will be his uncle coming to call, so Lady Sneerwell leaves. Indeed, it is Sir Oliver at the door, but due to Sir Oliver's disguise, Joseph thinks it is Mr. Stanley. Sir Oliver keeps pretending to be Mr. Stanley, saying he wants to meet with Sir Oliver as well in order to get some financial help. Joseph does not want this, and tries to push Mr. Stanley out the door. Charles arrives and thinks Sir Oliver is Mr. Premium. Both Charles and Joseph try to get the man to leave; in the confusion, Sir Peter, Lady Teazle, Maria, and Rowley all come in. Sir Oliver reveals to his nephews who he is, and that he decided to leave his money to Charles. Maria arrives, but she refuses to marry Charles because she heard rumors about a relationship between him and Lady Sneerwell. Snake reveals the truth, and then Maria agrees to marry Charles. The play ends with an epilogue, spoken by Lady Teazle to the audience.\", \"analysis\": \"Another example of dramatic irony can be found in Act V when Sir Oliver visits Joseph in disguise. Once again, Sir Oliver plays the role while giving many asides to the audience about Joseph's greed, and the audience is both entertained by Joseph's inability to recognize his own uncle  and also shocked along with Sir Oliver at Joseph's immoral behavior. It is clear that, unlike Charles, Joseph does not feel a sense of loyalty to his family, and that he does not value public honesty. Sheridan also uses Act V to continue satirizing the act of rumor-spreading itself. He does this primarily through the vivid and detailed imagery of the scene in which a group of characters discuss a supposed fight between Sir Peter and Joseph. Though the audience knows that there has been no duel, Crabtree delights the group of gossips as well as the audience with a drawn-out description of what he supposedly has heard to have happened between the men: \\\"A pair of pistols lay on the bureau , so, unluckily, the pistols were left charged... Sir Peter forced Charles to take one, and they fired, it seems, pretty nearly together. Charles's shot took effect, as I tell you, and Sir Peter's missed; but, what is very extraordinary, the ball struck against a little bronze Shakspeare that stood over the fireplace, grazed out of the window at a right angle, and wounded the postman, who was just coming to the door with a double letter from Northamptonshire\\\" . Sheridan purposefully writes this rumor and those like it throughout the play with precise, even exaggerated, detail to show how rumors can get out of hand due to the imagination and egotism of the spreaders. In Act V, Sheridan shows his beliefs about truth by giving the various plot lines of the story happy endings once truth is revealed. In Sir Peter and Lady Teazle's plot line, once Sir Peter finds out that Lady Teazle has had an affair , he decides to forgive her and even seems more hopeful about their marriage. When the truth comes out about the real characters of the Surface brothers, both Charles and Sir Oliver are happy, though Joseph, the greedy hypocrite, is not. Finally, once the truth about Lady Sneerwell's plot is outed by Snake, Maria and Charles are able to love one another in peace. Snake is a character who should not be overlooked in The School for Scandal. Though he appears only in the first and last scenes, it is he who transmits information about the rumors, trusting no one fully and loyal to nobody, and it is he who fully resolves the conflict of the play at the end of Act V. Ironically, Snake both begs forgiveness for his involvement in rumor-spreading, but also asks people not to tell others about his help in resolving the conflict, saying ironically that he lives and keeps his friends \\\"by the badness of  character\\\". The play ends with an epilogue; like prologues, these were quite common devices to call final attention to themes in the play and speak directly to the audience, urging them directly to take these themes and morals to heart. Lady Teazle delivers the epilogue of The School for Scandal, underscoring the importance of her role, especially as an outsider herself who could be seen as tainted by the pressures of London's upper-class societal norms. Though this epilogue, Sheridan urges the audience a final time to see this play not as simple entertainment, but rather as a harsh criticism of any who engage in gossip--both its creation and its transmission.\"}","chapter":"ACT V    SCENE I.\n\n--The Library\n\n     Enter SURFACE and SERVANT\n\nSURFACE. Mr. Stanley! and why should you think I would see him?--you\nmust know he came to ask something!\n\nSERVANT. Sir--I shouldn't have let him in but that Mr. Rowley came to\nthe Door with him.\n\nSURFACE. Pshaw!--Blockhead to suppose that I should now be in a Temper\nto receive visits from poor Relations!--well why don't you show the\nFellow up?\n\nSERVANT. I will--Sir--Why, Sir--it was not my Fault that Sir Peter\ndiscover'd my Lady----\n\nSURFACE. Go, fool!--\n\n    [Exit SERVANT.]\n\nSure Fortune never play'd a man of my policy such a Trick before--my\ncharacter with Sir Peter!--my Hopes with Maria!--destroy'd in a\nmoment!--I'm in a rare Humour to listen to other People's Distresses!--I\nshan't be able to bestow even a benevolent sentiment on Stanley--So!\nhere--He comes and Rowley with him--I MUST try to recover myself, and\nput a little Charity into my Face however.----\n\n     [Exit.]\n\n     Enter SIR OLIVER and ROWLEY\n\nSIR OLIVER. What! does He avoid us? that was He--was it not?\n\nROWLEY. It was Sir--but I doubt you are come a little too abruptly--his\nNerves are so weak that the sight of a poor Relation may be too much for\nhim--I should have gone first to break you to him.\n\nSIR OLIVER. A Plague of his Nerves--yet this is He whom Sir Peter\nextolls as a Man of the most Benevolent way of thinking!--\n\nROWLEY. As to his way of thinking--I can't pretend to decide[,] for, to\ndo him justice He appears to have as much speculative Benevolence as any\nprivate Gentleman in the Kingdom--though he is seldom so sensual as to\nindulge himself in the exercise of it----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Yet [he] has a string of charitable Sentiments I suppose at\nhis Fingers' ends!--\n\nROWLEY. Or, rather at his Tongue's end Sir Oliver; for I believe there\nis no sentiment he has more faith in than that 'Charity begins at Home.'\n\nSIR OLIVER. And his I presume is of that domestic sort which never stirs\nabroad at all.\n\nROWLEY. I doubt you'll find it so--but He's coming--I mustn't seem to\ninterrupt you--and you know immediately--as you leave him--I come in to\nannounce--your arrival in your real Character.\n\nSIR OLIVER. True--and afterwards you'll meet me at Sir Peter's----\n\nROWLEY. Without losing a moment.\n\n     [Exit.]\n\nSIR OLIVER. So--I see he has premeditated a Denial by the Complaisance\nof his Features.\n\n     Enter SURFACE\n\nSURFACE. Sir--I beg you ten thousand Pardons for keeping--you a moment\nwaiting--Mr. Stanley--I presume----\n\nSIR OLIVER. At your Service.\n\nSURFACE. Sir--I beg you will do me the honour to sit down--I entreat you\nSir.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Dear Sir there's no occasion--too civil by half!\n\nSURFACE. I have not the Pleasure of knowing you, Mr. Stanley--but I am\nextremely happy to see you look so well--you were nearly related to my\nmother--I think Mr. Stanley----\n\nSIR OLIVER. I was Sir--so nearly that my present Poverty I fear may do\ndiscredit to her Wealthy Children--else I should not have presumed to\ntrouble you.--\n\nSURFACE. Dear Sir--there needs no apology--He that is in Distress tho' a\nstranger has a right to claim kindred with the wealthy--I am sure I wish\nI was of that class, and had it in my power to offer you even a small\nrelief.\n\nSIR OLIVER. If your Unkle, Sir Oliver were here--I should have a\nFriend----\n\nSURFACE. I wish He was Sir, with all my Heart--you should not want an\nadvocate with him--believe me Sir.\n\nSIR OLIVER. I should not need one--my Distresses would recommend\nme.--but I imagined--his Bounty had enabled you to become the agent of\nhis Charity.\n\nSURFACE. My dear Sir--you are strangely misinformed--Sir Oliver is a\nworthy Man, a worthy man--a very worthy sort of Man--but avarice\nMr. Stanley is the vice of age--I will tell you my good Sir in\nconfidence:--what he has done for me has been a mere--nothing[;] tho'\nPeople I know have thought otherwise and for my Part I never chose to\ncontradict the Report.\n\nSIR OLIVER. What!--has he never\ntransmitted--you--Bullion--Rupees--Pagodas!\n\nSURFACE. O Dear Sir--Nothing of the kind--no--no--a few Presents now and\nthen--china, shawls, congo Tea, Avadavats--and indian Crackers--little\nmore, believe me.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Here's Gratitude for twelve thousand pounds!--Avadavats and\nindian Crackers.\n\nSURFACE. Then my dear--Sir--you have heard, I doubt not, of the\nextravagance of my Brother--Sir--there are very few would credit what I\nhave done for that unfortunate young man.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Not I for one!\n\nSURFACE. The sums I have lent him! indeed--I have been exceedingly to\nblame--it was an amiable weakness! however I don't pretend to defend\nit--and now I feel it doubly culpable--since it has deprived me of the\npower of serving YOU Mr. Stanley as my Heart directs----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Dissembler! Then Sir--you cannot assist me?\n\nSURFACE. At Present it grieves me to say I cannot--but whenever I have\nthe ability, you may depend upon hearing from me.\n\nSIR OLIVER. I am extremely sorry----\n\nSURFACE. Not more than I am believe me--to pity without the Power to\nrelieve is still more painful than to ask and be denied----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Kind Sir--your most obedient humble servant.\n\nSURFACE. You leave me deeply affected Mr. Stanley--William--be ready to\nopen the door----\n\nSIR OLIVER. O, Dear Sir, no ceremony----\n\nSURFACE. Your very obedient----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Your most obsequious----\n\nSURFACE. You may depend on hearing from me whenever I can be of\nservice----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Sweet Sir--you are too good----\n\nSURFACE. In the mean time I wish you Health and Spirits----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Your ever grateful and perpetual humble Servant----\n\nSURFACE. Sir--yours as sincerely----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Charles!--you are my Heir.\n\n     [Exit.]\n\nSURFACE, solus Soh!--This is one bad effect of a good Character--it\ninvites applications from the unfortunate and there needs no small\ndegree of address to gain the reputation of Benevolence without\nincurring the expence.--The silver ore of pure Charity is an expensive\narticle in the catalogue of a man's good Qualities--whereas the\nsentimental French Plate I use instead of it makes just as good a\nshew--and pays no tax.\n\n     Enter ROWLEY\n\nROWLEY. Mr. Surface--your Servant: I was apprehensive of interrupting\nyou, tho' my Business demands immediate attention--as this Note will\ninform you----\n\nSURFACE. Always Happy to see Mr. Rowley--how--Oliver--Surface!--My Unkle\narrived!\n\nROWLEY. He is indeed--we have just parted--quite well--after a speedy\nvoyage--and impatient to embrace his worthy Nephew.\n\nSURFACE. I am astonished!--William[!] stop Mr. Stanley, if He's not\ngone----\n\nROWLEY. O--He's out of reach--I believe.\n\nSURFACE. Why didn't you let me know this when you came in together.--\n\nROWLEY. I thought you had particular--Business--but must be gone to\ninform your Brother, and appoint him here to meet his Uncle. He will be\nwith you in a quarter of an hour----\n\nSURFACE. So he says. Well--I am strangely overjoy'd at his coming--never\nto be sure was anything so damn'd unlucky!\n\nROWLEY. You will be delighted to see how well He looks.\n\nSURFACE. O--I'm rejoiced to hear it--just at this time----\n\nROWLEY. I'll tell him how impatiently you expect him----\n\nSURFACE. Do--do--pray--give my best duty and affection--indeed, I cannot\nexpress the sensations I feel at the thought of seeing him!--certainly\nhis coming just at this Time is the cruellest piece of ill Fortune----\n\n     [Exeunt.]\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n--At SIR PETER'S House\n\n     Enter MRS. CANDOUR and SERVANT\n\nSERVANT. Indeed Ma'am, my Lady will see nobody at Present.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Did you tell her it was her Friend Mrs. Candour----\n\nSERVANT. Yes Ma'am but she begs you will excuse her----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Do go again--I shall be glad to see her if it be only for\na moment--for I am sure she must be in great Distress\n\n     [exit MAID]\n\n--Dear Heart--how provoking!--I'm not mistress of half the\ncircumstances!--We shall have the whole affair in the newspapers with\nthe Names of the Parties at length before I have dropt the story at a\ndozen houses.\n\n     Enter SIR BENJAMIN\n\nSir Benjamin you have heard, I suppose----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Of Lady Teazle and Mr. Surface----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. And Sir Peter's Discovery----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. O the strangest Piece of Business to be sure----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Well I never was so surprised in my life!--I am so sorry\nfor all Parties--indeed,\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Now I don't Pity Sir Peter at all--he was so\nextravagant--partial to Mr. Surface----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Mr. Surface!--why 'twas with Charles Lady Teazle was\ndetected.\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. No such thing Mr. Surface is the gallant.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. No--no--Charles is the man--'twas Mr. Surface brought Sir\nPeter on purpose to discover them----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. I tell you I have it from one----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. And I have it from one----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Who had it from one who had it----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. From one immediately--but here comes Lady\nSneerwell--perhaps she knows the whole affair.\n\n     Enter LADY SNEERWELL\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. So--my dear Mrs. Candour Here's a sad affair of our\nFriend Teazle----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye my dear Friend, who could have thought it.\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Well there is no trusting to appearances[;] tho'--indeed\nshe was always too lively for me.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. To be sure, her manners were a little too--free--but she\nwas very young----\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. And had indeed some good Qualities.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. So she had indeed--but have you heard the Particulars?\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. No--but everybody says that Mr. Surface----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Aye there I told you--Mr. Surface was the Man.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. No--no--indeed the assignation was with Charles----\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. With Charles!--You alarm me Mrs. Candour!\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Yes--yes He was the Lover--Mr. Surface--do him\njustice--was only the Informer.\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Well I'll not dispute with you Mrs. Candour--but be it\nwhich it may--I hope that Sir Peter's wound will not----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Sir Peter's wound! O mercy! I didn't hear a word of their\nFighting----\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Nor I a syllable!\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. No--what no mention of the Duel----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Not a word--\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. O, Lord--yes--yes--they fought before they left the Room.\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Pray let us hear.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye--do oblige--us with the Duel----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. 'Sir'--says Sir Peter--immediately after the Discovery,\n'you are a most ungrateful Fellow.'\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye to Charles----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. No, no--to Mr. Surface--'a most ungrateful Fellow; and old\nas I am, Sir,' says He, 'I insist on immediate satisfaction.'\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye that must have been to Charles for 'tis very unlikely\nMr. Surface should go to fight in his own House.\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Gad's Life, Ma'am, not at all--giving me immediate\nsatisfaction--on this, Madam--Lady Teazle seeing Sir Peter in such\nDanger--ran out of the Room in strong Hysterics--and Charles after her\ncalling out for Hartshorn and Water! Then Madam--they began to fight\nwith Swords----\n\n     Enter CRABTREE\n\nCRABTREE. With Pistols--Nephew--I have it from undoubted authority.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Oh, Mr. Crabtree then it is all true----\n\nCRABTREE. Too true indeed Ma'am, and Sir Peter Dangerously wounded----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. By a thrust in second--quite thro' his left side\n\nCRABTREE. By a Bullet lodged in the Thorax----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Mercy--on me[!] Poor Sir Peter----\n\nCRABTREE. Yes, ma'am tho' Charles would have avoided the matter if he\ncould----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. I knew Charles was the Person----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. O my Unkle I see knows nothing of the matter----\n\nCRABTREE. But Sir Peter tax'd him with the basest ingratitude----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. That I told you, you know----\n\nCRABTREE. Do Nephew let me speak--and insisted on immediate----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Just as I said----\n\nCRABTREE. Odds life! Nephew allow others to know something too--A Pair\nof Pistols lay on the Bureau--for Mr. Surface--it seems, had come home\nthe Night before late from Salt-Hill where He had been to see the Montem\nwith a Friend, who has a Son at Eton--so unluckily the Pistols were left\nCharged----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. I heard nothing of this----\n\nCRABTREE. Sir Peter forced Charles to take one and they fired--it seems\npretty nearly together--Charles's shot took Place as I tell you--and Sir\nPeter's miss'd--but what is very extraordinary the Ball struck against\na little Bronze Pliny that stood over the Fire Place--grazed out of the\nwindow at a right angle--and wounded the Postman, who was just coming to\nthe Door with a double letter from Northamptonshire.\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. My Unkle's account is more circumstantial I must\nconfess--but I believe mine is the true one for all that.\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. I am more interested in this Affair than they\nimagine--and must have better information.--\n\n     [Exit.]\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Ah! Lady Sneerwell's alarm is very easily accounted for.--\n\nCRABTREE. Yes yes, they certainly DO say--but that's neither here nor\nthere.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. But pray where is Sir Peter at present----\n\nCRABTREE. Oh! they--brought him home and He is now in the House, tho'\nthe Servants are order'd to deny it----\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. I believe so--and Lady Teazle--I suppose attending him----\n\nCRABTREE. Yes yes--and I saw one of the Faculty enter just before me----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Hey--who comes here----\n\nCRABTREE. Oh, this is He--the Physician depend on't.\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. O certainly it must be the Physician and now we shall\nknow----\n\n     Enter SIR OLIVER\n\nCRABTREE. Well, Doctor--what Hopes?\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye Doctor how's your Patient?\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Now Doctor isn't it a wound with a small sword----\n\nCRABTREE. A bullet lodged in the Thorax--for a hundred!\n\nSIR OLIVER. Doctor!--a wound with a small sword! and a Bullet in the\nThorax!--oon's are you mad, good People?\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Perhaps, Sir, you are not a Doctor.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Truly Sir I am to thank you for my degree If I am.\n\nCRABTREE. Only a Friend of Sir Peter's then I presume--but, sir, you\nmust have heard of this accident--\n\nSIR OLIVER. Not a word!\n\nCRABTREE. Not of his being dangerously wounded?\n\nSIR OLIVER. The Devil he is!\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Run thro' the Body----\n\nCRABTREE. Shot in the breast----\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. By one Mr. Surface----\n\nCRABTREE. Aye the younger.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Hey! what the plague! you seem to differ strangely in your\naccounts--however you agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded.\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. Oh yes, we agree in that.\n\nCRABTREE. Yes, yes, I believe there can be no doubt in that.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Then, upon my word, for a person in that Situation, he is\nthe most imprudent man alive--For here he comes walking as if nothing at\nall was the matter.\n\n     Enter SIR PETER\n\nOdd's heart, sir Peter! you are come in good time I promise you, for we\nhad just given you over!\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. 'Egad, Uncle this is the most sudden Recovery!\n\nSIR OLIVER. Why, man, what do you do out of Bed with a Small Sword\nthrough your Body, and a Bullet lodg'd in your Thorax?\n\nSIR PETER. A Small Sword and a Bullet--\n\nSIR OLIVER. Aye these Gentlemen would have kill'd you without Law or\nPhysic, and wanted to dub me a Doctor to make me an accomplice.\n\nSIR PETER. Why! what is all this?\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. We rejoice, Sir Peter, that the Story of the Duel is not\ntrue--and are sincerely sorry for your other Misfortune.\n\nSIR PETER. So--so--all over the Town already! [Aside.]\n\nCRABTREE. Tho', Sir Peter, you were certainly vastly to blame to marry\nat all at your years.\n\nSIR PETER. Sir, what Business is that of yours?\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Tho' Indeed, as Sir Peter made so good a Husband, he's\nvery much to be pitied.\n\nSIR PETER. Plague on your pity, Ma'am, I desire none of it.\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. However Sir Peter, you must not mind the Laughing and\njests you will meet with on the occasion.\n\nSIR PETER. Sir, I desire to be master in my own house.\n\nCRABTREE. 'Tis no Uncommon Case, that's one comfort.\n\nSIR PETER. I insist on being left to myself, without ceremony,--I insist\non your leaving my house directly!\n\nMRS. CANDOUR. Well, well, we are going and depend on't, we'll make the\nbest report of you we can.\n\nSIR PETER. Leave my house!\n\nCRABTREE. And tell how hardly you have been treated.\n\nSIR PETER. Leave my House--\n\nSIR BENJAMIN. And how patiently you bear it.\n\nSIR PETER. Friends! Vipers! Furies! Oh that their own Venom would choke\nthem!\n\nSIR OLIVER. They are very provoking indeed, Sir Peter.\n\n     Enter ROWLEY\n\nROWLEY. I heard high words: what has ruffled you Sir Peter--\n\nSIR PETER. Pshaw what signifies asking--do I ever pass a Day without my\nVexations?\n\nSIR OLIVER. Well I'm not Inquisitive--I come only to tell you, that I\nhave seen both my Nephews in the manner we proposed.\n\nSIR PETER. A Precious Couple they are!\n\nROWLEY. Yes and Sir Oliver--is convinced that your judgment was right\nSir Peter.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Yes I find Joseph is Indeed the Man after all.\n\nROWLEY. Aye as Sir Peter says, He's a man of Sentiment.\n\nSIR OLIVER. And acts up to the Sentiments he professes.\n\nROWLEY. It certainly is Edification to hear him talk.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Oh, He's a model for the young men of the age! But how's\nthis, Sir Peter? you don't Join us in your Friend Joseph's Praise as I\nexpected.\n\nSIR PETER. Sir Oliver, we live in a damned wicked world, and the fewer\nwe praise the better.\n\nROWLEY. What do YOU say so, Sir Peter--who were never mistaken in your\nLife?\n\nSIR PETER. Pshaw--Plague on you both--I see by your sneering you have\nheard--the whole affair--I shall go mad among you!\n\nROWLEY. Then to fret you no longer Sir Peter--we are indeed acquainted\nwith it all--I met Lady Teazle coming from Mr. Surface's so humbled,\nthat she deigned to request ME to be her advocate with you--\n\nSIR PETER. And does Sir Oliver know all too?\n\nSIR OLIVER. Every circumstance!\n\nSIR PETER. What of the closet and the screen--hey[?]\n\nSIR OLIVER. Yes yes--and the little French Milliner. Oh, I have been\nvastly diverted with the story! ha! ha! ha!\n\nSIR PETER. 'Twas very pleasant!\n\nSIR OLIVER. I never laugh'd more in my life, I assure you: ha! ha!\n\nSIR PETER. O vastly diverting! ha! ha!\n\nROWLEY. To be sure Joseph with his Sentiments! ha! ha!\n\nSIR PETER. Yes his sentiments! ha! ha! a hypocritical Villain!\n\nSIR OLIVER. Aye and that Rogue Charles--to pull Sir Peter out of the\ncloset: ha! ha!\n\nSIR PETER. Ha! ha! 'twas devilish entertaining to be sure--\n\nSIR OLIVER. Ha! ha! Egad, Sir Peter I should like to have seen your Face\nwhen the screen was thrown down--ha! ha!\n\nSIR PETER. Yes, my face when the Screen was thrown down: ha! ha! ha! O I\nmust never show my head again!\n\nSIR OLIVER. But come--come it isn't fair to laugh at you neither my old\nFriend--tho' upon my soul I can't help it--\n\nSIR PETER. O pray don't restrain your mirth on my account: it does not\nhurt me at all--I laugh at the whole affair myself--Yes--yes--I\nthink being a standing Jest for all one's acquaintance a very happy\nsituation--O yes--and then of a morning to read the Paragraphs about\nMr. S----, Lady T----, and Sir P----, will be so entertaining!--I shall\ncertainly leave town tomorrow and never look mankind in the Face again!\n\nROWLEY. Without affectation Sir Peter, you may despise the ridicule of\nFools--but I see Lady Teazle going towards the next Room--I am sure you\nmust desire a Reconciliation as earnestly as she does.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Perhaps MY being here prevents her coming to you--well I'll\nleave honest Rowley to mediate between you; but he must bring you all\npresently to Mr. Surface's--where I am now returning--if not to reclaim\na Libertine, at least to expose Hypocrisy.\n\nSIR PETER. Ah! I'll be present at your discovering yourself there with\nall my heart; though 'tis a vile unlucky Place for discoveries.\n\nSIR OLIVER. However it is very convenient to the carrying on of my Plot\nthat you all live so near one another!\n\n     [Exit SIR OLIVER.]\n\nROWLEY. We'll follow--\n\nSIR PETER. She is not coming here you see, Rowley--\n\nROWLEY. No but she has left the Door of that Room open you\nperceive.--see she is in Tears--!\n\nSIR PETER. She seems indeed to wish I should go to her.--how dejected\nshe appears--\n\nROWLEY. And will you refrain from comforting her--\n\nSIR PETER. Certainly a little mortification appears very becoming in a\nwife--don't you think it will do her good to let her Pine a little.\n\nROWLEY. O this is ungenerous in you--\n\nSIR PETER. Well I know not what to think--you remember Rowley the Letter\nI found of her's--evidently intended for Charles?\n\nROWLEY. A mere forgery, Sir Peter--laid in your way on Purpose--this is\none of the Points which I intend Snake shall give you conviction on--\n\nSIR PETER. I wish I were once satisfied of that--She looks this\nway----what a remarkably elegant Turn of the Head she has! Rowley I'll\ngo to her--\n\nROWLEY. Certainly--\n\nSIR PETER. Tho' when it is known that we are reconciled, People will\nlaugh at me ten times more!\n\nROWLEY. Let--them laugh--and retort their malice only by showing them\nyou are happy in spite of it.\n\nSIR PETER. Efaith so I will--and, if I'm not mistaken we may yet be the\nhappiest couple in the country--\n\nROWLEY. Nay Sir Peter--He who once lays aside suspicion----\n\nSIR PETER. Hold Master Rowley--if you have any Regard for me--never let\nme hear you utter anything like a Sentiment. I have had enough of THEM\nto serve me the rest of my Life.\n\n     [Exeunt.]\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE THE LAST.\n\n--The Library\n\n     SURFACE and LADY SNEERWELL\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Impossible! will not Sir Peter immediately be reconciled\nto CHARLES? and of consequence no longer oppose his union with MARIA?\nthe thought is Distraction to me!\n\nSURFACE. Can Passion--furnish a Remedy?\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. No--nor cunning either. O I was a Fool, an Ideot--to\nleague with such a Blunderer!\n\nSURFACE. Surely Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest Sufferer--yet you see I\nbear the accident with Calmness.\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Because the Disappointment hasn't reached your\nHEART--your interest only attached you to Maria--had you felt for\nher--what I have for that ungrateful Libertine--neither your Temper nor\nHypocrisy could prevent your showing the sharpness of your Vexation.\n\nSURFACE. But why should your Reproaches fall on me for this\nDisappointment?\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Are not you the cause of it? what had you to bate in\nyour Pursuit of Maria to pervert Lady Teazle by the way.--had you not a\nsufficient field for your Roguery in blinding Sir Peter and supplanting\nyour Brother--I hate such an avarice of crimes--'tis an unfair monopoly\nand never prospers.\n\nSURFACE. Well I admit I have been to blame--I confess I deviated from\nthe direct Road of wrong but I don't think we're so totally defeated\nneither.\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. No!\n\nSURFACE. You tell me you have made a trial of Snake since we met--and\nthat you still believe him faithful to us--\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. I do believe so.\n\nSURFACE. And that he has undertaken should it be necessary--to swear and\nprove that Charles is at this Time contracted by vows and Honour to\nyour Ladyship--which some of his former letters to you will serve to\nsupport--\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. This, indeed, might have assisted--\n\nSURFACE. Come--come it is not too late yet--but hark! this is probably\nmy Unkle Sir Oliver--retire to that Room--we'll consult further when\nHe's gone.--\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Well but if HE should find you out to--\n\nSURFACE. O I have no fear of that--Sir Peter will hold his tongue for\nhis own credit sake--and you may depend on't I shall soon Discover Sir\nOliver's weak side!--\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. I have no diffidence of your abilities--only be constant\nto one roguery at a time--\n\n     [Exit.]\n\nSURFACE. I will--I will--So 'tis confounded hard after such bad Fortune,\nto be baited by one's confederate in evil--well at all events\nmy character is so much better than Charles's, that I\ncertainly--hey--what!--this is not Sir Oliver--but old Stanley\nagain!--Plague on't that He should return to teaze me just now--I shall\nhave Sir Oliver come and find him here--and----\n\n     Enter SIR OLIVER\n\nGad's life, Mr. Stanley--why have you come back to plague me at this\ntime? you must not stay now upon my word!\n\nSIR OLIVER. Sir--I hear your Unkle Oliver is expected here--and tho' He\nhas been so penurious to you, I'll try what He'll do for me--\n\nSURFACE. Sir! 'tis impossible for you to stay now--so I must beg----come\nany other time and I promise you you shall be assisted.\n\nSIR OLIVER. No--Sir Oliver and I must be acquainted--\n\nSURFACE. Zounds Sir then [I] insist on your quitting the--Room\ndirectly--\n\nSIR OLIVER. Nay Sir----\n\nSURFACE. Sir--I insist on't--here William show this Gentleman out. Since\nyou compel me Sir--not one moment--this is such insolence.\n\n     [Going to push him out.]\n\n     Enter CHARLES\n\nCHARLES. Heyday! what's the matter now?--what the Devil have you got\nhold of my little Broker here! Zounds--Brother, don't hurt little\nPremium. What's the matter--my little Fellow?\n\nSURFACE. So! He has been with you, too, has He--\n\nCHARLES. To be sure He has! Why, 'tis as honest a little----But sure\nJoseph you have not been borrowing money too have you?\n\nSURFACE. Borrowing--no!--But, Brother--you know sure we expect Sir\nOliver every----\n\nCHARLES. O Gad, that's true--Noll mustn't find the little Broker here to\nbe sure--\n\nSURFACE. Yet Mr. Stanley insists----\n\nCHARLES. Stanley--why his name's Premium--\n\nSURFACE. No no Stanley.\n\nCHARLES. No, no--Premium.\n\nSURFACE. Well no matter which--but----\n\nCHARLES. Aye aye Stanley or Premium, 'tis the same thing as you say--for\nI suppose He goes by half a hundred Names, besides A. B's at the\nCoffee-House. [Knock.]\n\nSURFACE. 'Sdeath--here's Sir Oliver at the Door----Now I beg--Mr.\nStanley----\n\nCHARLES. Aye aye and I beg Mr. Premium----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Gentlemen----\n\nSURFACE. Sir, by Heaven you shall go--\n\nCHARLES. Aye out with him certainly----\n\nSIR OLIVER. This violence----\n\nSURFACE. 'Tis your own Fault.\n\nCHARLES. Out with him to be sure.     [Both forcing SIR OLIVER out.]\n\n     Enter SIR PETER TEAZLE, LADY TEAZLE, MARIA, and ROWLEY\n\nSIR PETER. My old Friend, Sir Oliver!--hey! what in the name of\nwonder!--Here are dutiful Nephews!--assault their Unkle at his first\nVisit!\n\nLADY TEAZLE. Indeed Sir Oliver 'twas well we came in to rescue you.\n\nROWLEY. Truly it was--for I perceive Sir Oliver the character of old\nStanley was no Protection to you.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Nor of Premium either--the necessities of the former could\nnot extort a shilling from that benevolent Gentleman; and with the other\nI stood a chance of faring worse than my Ancestors, and being knocked\ndown without being bid for.\n\nSURFACE. Charles!\n\nCHARLES. Joseph!\n\nSURFACE. 'Tis compleat!\n\nCHARLES. Very!\n\nSIR OLIVER. Sir Peter--my Friend and Rowley too--look on that elder\nNephew of mine--You know what He has already received from my Bounty and\nyou know also how gladly I would have look'd on half my Fortune as held\nin trust for him--judge then my Disappointment in discovering him to be\ndestitute of Truth--Charity--and Gratitude--\n\nSIR PETER. Sir Oliver--I should be more surprized at this Declaration,\nif I had not myself found him to be selfish--treacherous and\nHypocritical.\n\nLADY TEAZLE. And if the Gentleman pleads not guilty to these pray let\nhim call ME to his Character.\n\nSIR PETER. Then I believe we need add no more--if He knows himself He\nwill consider it as the most perfect Punishment that He is known to the\nworld--\n\nCHARLES. If they talk this way to Honesty--what will they say to ME by\nand bye!\n\nSIR OLIVER. As for that Prodigal--his Brother there----\n\nCHARLES. Aye now comes my Turn--the damn'd Family Pictures will ruin\nme--\n\nSURFACE. Sir Oliver--Unkle--will you honour me with a hearing--\n\nCHARLES. I wish Joseph now would make one of his long speeches and I\nmight recollect myself a little--\n\nSIR OLIVER. And I suppose you would undertake to vindicate yourself\nentirely--\n\nSURFACE. I trust I could--\n\nSIR OLIVER. Nay--if you desert your Roguery in its Distress and try to\nbe justified--you have even less principle than I thought you had.--[To\nCHARLES SURFACE] Well, Sir--and YOU could JUSTIFY yourself too I\nsuppose--\n\nCHARLES. Not that I know of, Sir Oliver.\n\nSIR OLIVER. What[!] little Premium has been let too much into the secret\nI presume.\n\nCHARLES. True--Sir--but they were Family Secrets, and should not be\nmentioned again you know.\n\nROWLEY. Come Sir Oliver I know you cannot speak of Charles's Follies\nwith anger.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Odd's heart no more I can--nor with gravity either--Sir\nPeter do you know the Rogue bargain'd with me for all his\nAncestors--sold me judges and Generals by the Foot, and Maiden Aunts as\ncheap as broken China!\n\nCHARLES. To be sure, Sir Oliver, I did make a little free with the\nFamily Canvas that's the truth on't:--my Ancestors may certainly rise in\njudgment against me there's no denying it--but believe me sincere when I\ntell you, and upon my soul I would not say so if I was not--that if I do\nnot appear mortified at the exposure of my Follies, it is because I\nfeel at this moment the warmest satisfaction in seeing you, my liberal\nbenefactor.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Charles--I believe you--give me your hand again: the\nill-looking little fellow over the Couch has made your Peace.\n\nCHARLES. Then Sir--my Gratitude to the original is still encreased.\n\nLADY TEAZLE. [Advancing.] Yet I believe, Sir Oliver, here is one whom\nCharles is still more anxious to be reconciled to.\n\nSIR OLIVER. O I have heard of his Attachment there--and, with the young\nLady's Pardon if I construe right that Blush----\n\nSIR PETER. Well--Child--speak your sentiments--you know--we are going to\nbe reconciled to Charles--\n\nMARIA. Sir--I have little to say--but that I shall rejoice to hear that\nHe is happy--For me--whatever claim I had to his Affection--I willing\nresign to one who has a better title.\n\nCHARLES. How Maria!\n\nSIR PETER. Heyday--what's the mystery now? while he appeared an\nincorrigible Rake, you would give your hand to no one else and now that\nHe's likely to reform I'll warrant You won't have him!\n\nMARIA. His own Heart--and Lady Sneerwell know the cause.\n\n[CHARLES.] Lady Sneerwell!\n\nSURFACE. Brother it is with great concern--I am obliged to speak on\nthis Point, but my Regard to justice obliges me--and Lady Sneerwell's\ninjuries can no longer--be concealed--[Goes to the Door.]\n\n     Enter LADY SNEERWELL\n\nSIR PETER. Soh! another French milliner egad! He has one in every Room\nin the House I suppose--\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Ungrateful Charles! Well may you be surprised and feel\nfor the indelicate situation which your Perfidy has forced me into.\n\nCHARLES. Pray Unkle, is this another Plot of yours? for as I have Life I\ndon't understand it.\n\nSURFACE. I believe Sir there is but the evidence of one Person more\nnecessary to make it extremely clear.\n\nSIR PETER. And that Person--I imagine, is Mr. Snake--Rowley--you were\nperfectly right to bring him with us--and pray let him appear.\n\nROWLEY. Walk in, Mr. Snake--\n\n     Enter SNAKE\n\nI thought his Testimony might be wanted--however it happens unluckily\nthat He comes to confront Lady Sneerwell and not to support her--\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. A Villain!--Treacherous to me at last! Speak, Fellow,\nhave you too conspired against me?\n\nSNAKE. I beg your Ladyship--ten thousand Pardons--you paid me extremely\nLiberally for the Lie in question--but I unfortunately have been offer'd\ndouble to speak the Truth.\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. The Torments of Shame and Disappointment on you all!\n\nLADY TEAZLE. Hold--Lady Sneerwell--before you go let me thank you for\nthe trouble you and that Gentleman have taken in writing Letters from me\nto Charles and answering them yourself--and let me also request you\nto make my Respects to the Scandalous College--of which you are\nPresident--and inform them that Lady Teazle, Licentiate, begs leave to\nreturn the diploma they granted her--as she leaves of[f] Practice and\nkills Characters no longer.\n\nLADY SNEERWELL. Provoking--insolent!--may your Husband live these fifty\nyears!\n\n     [Exit.]\n\nSIR PETER. Oons what a Fury----\n\nLADY TEAZLE. A malicious Creature indeed!\n\nSIR PETER. Hey--not for her last wish?--\n\nLADY TEAZLE. O No--\n\nSIR OLIVER. Well Sir, and what have you to say now?\n\nSURFACE. Sir, I am so confounded, to find that Lady Sneerwell could be\nguilty of suborning Mr. Snake in this manner to impose on us all that\nI know not what to say----however, lest her Revengeful Spirit should\nprompt her to injure my Brother I had certainly better follow her\ndirectly.\n\n     [Exit.]\n\nSIR PETER. Moral to the last drop!\n\nSIR OLIVER. Aye and marry her Joseph if you can.--Oil and Vinegar\negad:--you'll do very well together.\n\nROWLEY. I believe we have no more occasion for Mr. Snake at Present--\n\nSNAKE. Before I go--I beg Pardon once for all for whatever uneasiness I\nhave been the humble instrument of causing to the Parties present.\n\nSIR PETER. Well--well you have made atonement by a good Deed at last--\n\nSNAKE. But I must Request of the Company that it shall never be known--\n\nSIR PETER. Hey!--what the Plague--are you ashamed of having done a right\nthing once in your life?\n\nSNAKE. Ah: Sir--consider I live by the Badness of my Character!--I have\nnothing but my Infamy to depend on!--and, if it were once known that I\nhad been betray'd into an honest Action, I should lose every Friend I\nhave in the world.\n\nSIR OLIVER. Well--well we'll not traduce you by saying anything to your\nPraise never fear.\n\n     [Exit SNAKE.]\n\nSIR PETER. There's a precious Rogue--Yet that fellow is a Writer and a\nCritic.\n\nLADY TEAZLE. See[,] Sir Oliver[,] there needs no persuasion now to\nreconcile your Nephew and Maria--\n\nSIR OLIVER. Aye--aye--that's as it should be and egad we'll have the\nwedding to-morrow morning--\n\nCHARLES. Thank you, dear Unkle!\n\nSIR PETER. What! you rogue don't you ask the Girl's consent first--\n\nCHARLES. Oh, I have done that a long time--above a minute ago--and She\nhas look'd yes--\n\nMARIA. For Shame--Charles--I protest Sir Peter, there has not been a\nword----\n\nSIR OLIVER. Well then the fewer the Better--may your love for each other\nnever know--abatement.\n\nSIR PETER. And may you live as happily together as Lady Teazle and\nI--intend to do--\n\nCHARLES. Rowley my old Friend--I am sure you congratulate me and I\nsuspect too that I owe you much.\n\nSIR OLIVER. You do, indeed, Charles--\n\nROWLEY. If my Efforts to serve you had not succeeded you would have been\nin my debt for the attempt--but deserve to be happy--and you over-repay\nme.\n\nSIR PETER. Aye honest Rowley always said you would reform.\n\nCHARLES. Why as to reforming Sir Peter I'll make no promises--and that\nI take to be a proof that I intend to set about it--But here shall be my\nMonitor--my gentle Guide.--ah! can I leave the Virtuous path those Eyes\nillumine?\n\n   Tho' thou, dear Maid, should'st wave [waive] thy Beauty's Sway,\n   --Thou still must Rule--because I will obey:\n   An humbled fugitive from Folly View,\n   No sanctuary near but Love and YOU:\n   You can indeed each anxious Fear remove,\n   For even Scandal dies if you approve.

Sir Oliver is disguised as Mr. Stanley, Joseph's poor relative. Joseph refuses to help Stanley financially, claiming that he has no money, even though Sir Oliver sent him a large sum of money from India. Sir Oliver is angered by this and declares, \"Charles! You are my heir\" as he exits. After \"Mr. Stanley\" leaves, Rowley returns and tells Joseph that his uncle has arrived in town. Joseph asks Rowley to stop Mr. Stanley, but Rowley says he thinks it won't be possible. Joseph is still upset that all this business is happening at such an inopportune time, but he is excited to see his uncle. Scene II takes place at Sir Peter's house. Lady Sneerwell, Mrs. Candour, Sir Benjamin, and eventually Crabtree talk about the rumors surrounding Lady Teazle. The rumors are blown out of proportion as they report to one another that Charles and Sir Peter supposedly dueled with either swords or guns. Lady Sneerwell hides her involvement in the issue somewhat, and leaves the group discussing the rumor. Soon after Lady Sneerwell leaves, Sir Oliver arrives at the house. They believe him to be the doctor, present to tend to Sir Peter's wound from the supposed duel. Sir Oliver tells them he is not a doctor, calling attention to the differences in the stories he is being told--the parties still not agreeing on whether the wound came from a sword or a bullet. Sir Peter then arrives and everyone makes a fuss about him not being wounded after all. The group makes fun of him and he throws them out of his house, telling them he wants neither their jokes nor their pity. Finally, only Sir Oliver remains, and Rowley returns. Sir Oliver tells Sir Peter about his visits with both nephews. Sir Oliver also says that he too has heard the story of Sir Peter, Lady Teazle, Joseph, and Charles, and laughs at his friend. They all laugh together, and Sir Peter laments without much feeling how the gossip will continue to circulate through the papers. Sir Oliver leaves so that Sir Peter can reconcile with his wife. Rowley and Sir Peter discuss how badly Lady Teazle is feeling about what happened and Sir Peter suggests that he might leave her to feel bad for a while instead of going to speak to her. Rowley chides him, and Sir Peter agrees to go make up with her. Lady Sneerwell and Joseph meet to discuss whether Sir Peter will now reconcile with Charles and let him marry Maria. Lady Sneerwell scolds him for ruining the plot. Joseph suggests that if Snake is still faithful to them, it may not be too late. They hear a knocking at the door; Joseph thinks this will be his uncle coming to call, so Lady Sneerwell leaves. Indeed, it is Sir Oliver at the door, but due to Sir Oliver's disguise, Joseph thinks it is Mr. Stanley. Sir Oliver keeps pretending to be Mr. Stanley, saying he wants to meet with Sir Oliver as well in order to get some financial help. Joseph does not want this, and tries to push Mr. Stanley out the door. Charles arrives and thinks Sir Oliver is Mr. Premium. Both Charles and Joseph try to get the man to leave; in the confusion, Sir Peter, Lady Teazle, Maria, and Rowley all come in. Sir Oliver reveals to his nephews who he is, and that he decided to leave his money to Charles. Maria arrives, but she refuses to marry Charles because she heard rumors about a relationship between him and Lady Sneerwell. Snake reveals the truth, and then Maria agrees to marry Charles. The play ends with an epilogue, spoken by Lady Teazle to the audience.","summary_analysis":"Another example of dramatic irony can be found in Act V when Sir Oliver visits Joseph in disguise. Once again, Sir Oliver plays the role while giving many asides to the audience about Joseph's greed, and the audience is both entertained by Joseph's inability to recognize his own uncle  and also shocked along with Sir Oliver at Joseph's immoral behavior. It is clear that, unlike Charles, Joseph does not feel a sense of loyalty to his family, and that he does not value public honesty. Sheridan also uses Act V to continue satirizing the act of rumor-spreading itself. He does this primarily through the vivid and detailed imagery of the scene in which a group of characters discuss a supposed fight between Sir Peter and Joseph. Though the audience knows that there has been no duel, Crabtree delights the group of gossips as well as the audience with a drawn-out description of what he supposedly has heard to have happened between the men: \"A pair of pistols lay on the bureau , so, unluckily, the pistols were left charged... Sir Peter forced Charles to take one, and they fired, it seems, pretty nearly together. Charles's shot took effect, as I tell you, and Sir Peter's missed; but, what is very extraordinary, the ball struck against a little bronze Shakspeare that stood over the fireplace, grazed out of the window at a right angle, and wounded the postman, who was just coming to the door with a double letter from Northamptonshire\" . Sheridan purposefully writes this rumor and those like it throughout the play with precise, even exaggerated, detail to show how rumors can get out of hand due to the imagination and egotism of the spreaders. In Act V, Sheridan shows his beliefs about truth by giving the various plot lines of the story happy endings once truth is revealed. In Sir Peter and Lady Teazle's plot line, once Sir Peter finds out that Lady Teazle has had an affair , he decides to forgive her and even seems more hopeful about their marriage. When the truth comes out about the real characters of the Surface brothers, both Charles and Sir Oliver are happy, though Joseph, the greedy hypocrite, is not. Finally, once the truth about Lady Sneerwell's plot is outed by Snake, Maria and Charles are able to love one another in peace. Snake is a character who should not be overlooked in The School for Scandal. Though he appears only in the first and last scenes, it is he who transmits information about the rumors, trusting no one fully and loyal to nobody, and it is he who fully resolves the conflict of the play at the end of Act V. Ironically, Snake both begs forgiveness for his involvement in rumor-spreading, but also asks people not to tell others about his help in resolving the conflict, saying ironically that he lives and keeps his friends \"by the badness of  character\". The play ends with an epilogue; like prologues, these were quite common devices to call final attention to themes in the play and speak directly to the audience, urging them directly to take these themes and morals to heart. Lady Teazle delivers the epilogue of The School for Scandal, underscoring the importance of her role, especially as an outsider herself who could be seen as tainted by the pressures of London's upper-class societal norms. Though this epilogue, Sheridan urges the audience a final time to see this play not as simple entertainment, but rather as a harsh criticism of any who engage in gossip--both its creation and its transmission.","summary_length":640.0,"analysis_length":603.0,"chap_int":5,"previous summary id":["act iv"],"previous chapter":["Charles sells every painting of his ancestors except for a portrait of Sir Oliver. When \"Mr. Premium\" offers to pay a large sum of money for it, Charles still refuses to sell it. After the deal is done, Charles sends a sum of money for the relief of Mr. Stanley, despite's Rowley's objections. Sir Oliver thinks about Charles' behavior when Rowley comes with the money Charles sent for Mr. Stanley. After this, Sir Oliver decides to go and visit Joseph as Mr. Stanley to see how he will behave. Meanwhile, Lady Teazle is paying a visit to Joseph. A servant announces that Sir Peter has also come to call on Joseph, and Lady Teazle hides behind a screen. Sir Peter tells Joseph about the rumored relationship between his wife and Charles and also urges Joseph to marry Maria--much to Joseph's displeasure, since he had just been trying to convince Lady Teazle to cheat on her husband with him. Charles is announced, and Sir Peter decides to hide as well behind the screen. Sir Peter sees a woman behind the screen, but Joseph convinces him that it is just some random woman--a French milliner. Sir Peter hides in a closet instead. Charles enters; and he and Joseph start talking about Lady Teazle, and how Charles thinks that Joseph and her are in a relationship. Joseph tries to get him off the subject, but Charles does not understand, so Joseph tells him quietly that Sir Peter is hiding in the room. Charles immediately lets Sir Peter come out, and Sir Peter apologizes for believing that there is something between his wife and him. Lady Sneerwell is announced, and Joseph leaves to stop her from entering the room.

Sir Oliver is disguised as Mr. Stanley, Joseph's poor relative. Joseph refuses to help Stanley financially, claiming that he has no money, even though Sir Oliver sent him a large sum of money from India. Sir Oliver is angered by this and declares, \"Charles! You are my heir\" as he exits. After \"Mr. Stanley\" leaves, Rowley returns and tells Joseph that his uncle has arrived in town. Joseph asks Rowley to stop Mr. Stanley, but Rowley says he thinks it won't be possible. Joseph is still upset that all this business is happening at such an inopportune time, but he is excited to see his uncle. Scene II takes place at Sir Peter's house. Lady Sneerwell, Mrs. Candour, Sir Benjamin, and eventually Crabtree talk about the rumors surrounding Lady Teazle. The rumors are blown out of proportion as they report to one another that Charles and Sir Peter supposedly dueled with either swords or guns. Lady Sneerwell hides her involvement in the issue somewhat, and leaves the group discussing the rumor. Soon after Lady Sneerwell leaves, Sir Oliver arrives at the house. They believe him to be the doctor, present to tend to Sir Peter's wound from the supposed duel. Sir Oliver tells them he is not a doctor, calling attention to the differences in the stories he is being told--the parties still not agreeing on whether the wound came from a sword or a bullet. Sir Peter then arrives and everyone makes a fuss about him not being wounded after all. The group makes fun of him and he throws them out of his house, telling them he wants neither their jokes nor their pity. Finally, only Sir Oliver remains, and Rowley returns. Sir Oliver tells Sir Peter about his visits with both nephews. Sir Oliver also says that he too has heard the story of Sir Peter, Lady Teazle, Joseph, and Charles, and laughs at his friend. They all laugh together, and Sir Peter laments without much feeling how the gossip will continue to circulate through the papers. Sir Oliver leaves so that Sir Peter can reconcile with his wife. Rowley and Sir Peter discuss how badly Lady Teazle is feeling about what happened and Sir Peter suggests that he might leave her to feel bad for a while instead of going to speak to her. Rowley chides him, and Sir Peter agrees to go make up with her. Lady Sneerwell and Joseph meet to discuss whether Sir Peter will now reconcile with Charles and let him marry Maria. Lady Sneerwell scolds him for ruining the plot. Joseph suggests that if Snake is still faithful to them, it may not be too late. They hear a knocking at the door; Joseph thinks this will be his uncle coming to call, so Lady Sneerwell leaves. Indeed, it is Sir Oliver at the door, but due to Sir Oliver's disguise, Joseph thinks it is Mr. Stanley. Sir Oliver keeps pretending to be Mr. Stanley, saying he wants to meet with Sir Oliver as well in order to get some financial help. Joseph does not want this, and tries to push Mr. Stanley out the door. Charles arrives and thinks Sir Oliver is Mr. Premium. Both Charles and Joseph try to get the man to leave; in the confusion, Sir Peter, Lady Teazle, Maria, and Rowley all come in. Sir Oliver reveals to his nephews who he is, and that he decided to leave his money to Charles. Maria arrives, but she refuses to marry Charles because she heard rumors about a relationship between him and Lady Sneerwell. Snake reveals the truth, and then Maria agrees to marry Charles. The play ends with an epilogue, spoken by Lady Teazle to the audience."}
